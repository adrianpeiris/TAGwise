how will i rest in peace if i'm buried by a highway?// (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to W...,"KennyHoopla - how will i rest in peace if i’m buried by a highway?//. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

The next time anyone tells you rock n roll has gone stale, play ‘em a KennyHoopla track. The intro seconds of his 2020 alt-radio breakout “how will i rest in peace if i’m buried by a highway//“ can cause first time listeners to double check they’re not listening to Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasures.” But then, like foreign spices in a familiar dish, that visceral scream and hi-fi drum machine creates an entirely new flavor profile. ""I'm not trying to mix genres. It's just a sonic exploration,"" says Kenneth La’Ron, who has recently called Wisconsin home. Makes sense: he’s a child of the 00s after all, having grown up in an age when any curious audiophile could find good music regardless of the physical - or genre - limitations of a record store. Our DSCVR program previously tapped Kenny for an at-home performance this summer. He’s kept on rollin’ since then, getting co-signs from Zane Lowe and recently releasing a collaboration with Travis Barker, “ESTELLA//.” That’s a pretty cool achievement for a kid who grew up idolizing blink-182. And for someone who says “I don’t really know what I’m doing” in regards to the whole music-making thing, the millions of streams he’s quickly accrued off his debut EP say otherwise. So do these performances of “how will i rest” and “ESTELLA//.” Due to travel restrictions, neither his band nor Barker could swing the trip, but Kenny carried the energy like a guy who definitely knows what he’s doing.

Israel launch hundreds of air strikes on Syrian military assets and seize positions | BBC News,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its air force and navy have conducted hundreds of strikes since Saturday night on targets across Syria. 
 
The IDF said these strikes have taken out an estimated 70-80% of Syrian strategic military assets, from Damascus to Latakia.
 
Earlier, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented more than 310 strikes by the IDF since the Syrian government was overthrown by rebels on Sunday.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Syrian rebel group that ousted President Bashar al-Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, that Israel would ""respond forcefully"" if they allow Iran to ""re-establish itself in Syria"".
 
He has previously expressed a desire for peaceful ties with the new Syrian government, and cast its interventions as defensive.

How MSF is Supporting Hospitals in Syria After the Earthquake,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has supported 38 hospitals and health facilities throughout northwestern Syria since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck on February 6. 

MSF teams have responded to a lack of adequate supplies by donating emergency kits, trauma kits, blankets, medicines, medical supplies, laboratory equipment, and medical consumables.

""We set up an emergency system so our ambulances could be at the disposal of any nearby hospital to bring the injured,” said Mohammad Darwish, MSF's deputy coordinator in Idlib governorate. ""We also built a crew with previous  experience with earthquakes and other crises, along with doctors who headed to the neighboring hospitals to help treat the injured there."" 

From February 6 to 12, MSF-supported facilities treated more than 7,600 people injured in the quake and recorded around 1,000 deaths. Read more at https://bit.ly/410CnLq

Hong Kong protests: Tear gas fired at unauthorised demonstrators - BBC News,"Thousands of protesters in Hong Kong have taken to the streets, blocking major roads and defying a police ban.

The protesters wore black and held umbrellas, chanting anti-police slogans while marching through the territory's business district.

Police had given permission for a rally in Chater Garden, but warned that protests outside the park were illegal.

On Saturday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at another pro-democracy protest in Yuen Long, in the north.

Hong Kong has seen seven consecutive weeks of anti-government and pro-democracy protests.

It is ranked as one of the safest cities in the world - but recent protests have been followed by violent clashes between demonstrators, police, and masked men wielding sticks.

28 SIMPLE FIXING HACKS THAT WILL SAVE YOUR DAY,"AMAZING QUICK FIXES THAT WORK WONDERS

Time to get into the handy/engineering mindset and try out your fixing skills. If someone is broken in your home, don’t throw it out and get a new one, you can just try and fix it instead. Sometimes, it's easier than you think. 
If your face powder is broken, try to mush it up evenly with a nail tool or a spatula, pour some alcohol inside, and then mix it all together. Let it sit and voila – all fixed. 
Remove scratches from your phone by burning the back of a spoon. Then, wipe off the black residue using a cotton pad and wipe your screen with it. 
If some of your popcorn wasn’t properly cooked, you can separate them from the cooked popcorn and add them in the microwave for a few more seconds. 
If you see some white build-up on your colored pencils, and they aren’t as opaque as they used to be, you can either sharpen them or place them in water for a few minutes. They’ll soften up and you can draw again. 
You can attach the neck of a plastic bottle on your hairdryer and use it to inflate your airbed.

US Supreme Court strikes down abortion rights - BBC News,"Millions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned the 50-year-old Roe v Wade ruling that legalised it nationwide.

The court struck down the landmark ruling, weeks after an unprecedented leaked document suggested it favoured doing so.

The judgement will transform abortion rights in America, with individual states now able to ban the procedure, and half of US states expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.

22 HELPFUL HACKS TO HELP YOU SURVIVE,"GENIUS SURVIVAL TRICKS EVERYONE SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL

Survival skills and lifehacks usually come with experience. But not everyone has spent a ton of time outdoors to learn most things. So, in this video, I teach you some life-saving tricks that are extremely useful. 
When going swimming, attach a hook on a wine-cork and then attach your key to it, this way, even in the ocean, your keys will float in case you lose them, and it will be easy to locate them. 
To unclog your toilet, wrap the toilet sit in some cling-film – (make sure it’s air-tight), then flush your toilet and voila. 
To help you protect yourself from possible predators, I show you some amazing self-defense tricks that might help you get away and fight back. 
I also show you some lifehacks using panty liners. For example, when you are at a public shower, you can use panty liners to make flip-flops and prevent your feet from touching the ground. You can also use them as DIY makeup removers by soaking them with micellar water. 
Watch until the end to find out some smart ways to escape cable ties and how to make a fire starter with batteries.

***TRAVEL VLOG 348*** 
Thanks for the music, Unwritten Stories! - “Good Morning”  (https://soundcloud.com/unwritten-stories)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Mike's New Car (2002) with healthbars,"Mike is obsessed with his new six-wheel drive car, and insists on showing it off to his pal Sulley. Unfortunately for Mike, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Sulley plays with the ultra-adjustable seats until an annoyed Mike asks him to stop. Mike starts the engine and the seatbelt reminder tone sounds. He finds his seatbelt stuck and accidentally locks himself out of the car while trying to unstick it.

Sulley, trying to be helpful but confused by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, pops the hood open. When he closes it, he ends up trapping Mike in the engine compartment. Mike manages to escape, re-enters the car, and is exasperated by the continuous seatbelt reminder tone. Sulley reaches for another button on the dash, so just as Mike manages to put his seatbelt on, Sulley turns the windshield wipers on by accident. Mike shouts, ""Don't touch anything!"" and pushes a button that launches the entire car into chaotic malfunction, such as conga music (""Jungle Baby"" by Hans Ehrlinger) playing loudly.

Mike finally ends the chaos by pulling the key out of the ignition, and Sulley adds insult to injury when, in an attempt to realign the rearview mirror, he breaks it off. Mike orders Sulley to get out of the car, and speeds away, wrecking the car completely. Sulley mutters, ""Huh, that's weird, the airbag didn't go off."" Right on cue, the airbag inflates, and its force sends Mike flying back up the street. Sulley catches Mike, who mourns for his old car before agreeing to walk to work while the credits roll.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Sun,"Hottest takes in the solar system? Here comes the sun on this explainer, where Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice break down solar flares, sun spots, and all the things you thought you knew about the star at the center of our solar system.

How big is the sun? We wrap our heads around the scale of our universe and the role of the sun on our planet. If the sun were magically plucked from its spot, how long would it take for us to realize it? What is “solar max”? How to do sunspots work? What about solar flares? Can they break our satellites? We break down the mechanics of the sun’s interior, the merry-go-round effect, and the flipping of the sun's poles. All that, plus, what are deep sea fishes’ experience with the sun?

10 Exotic Animals You Can Keep as Pets at Home,"How to keep an exotic pet. It can be a skunk, a fennec, or even a capybara. Above all, it’ll cost you quite a lot of money and effort to take care of one of those creatures. But if you’re ready to accept the challenges and responsibilities, pay attention to these important tips any exotic pet owner must follow.

TIMESTAMPS:
Capybara 1:08
Fennec 2:23
Axolotl 3:28
Sugar Glider 4:49
Genet 5:56
Hedgehog 6:56 
Electric Blue Crayfish 7:43
Kinkajou 8:36
Fox 9:40 
Skunk 11:14

Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music 

SUMMARY:
- The capybara is a huge but very friendly rodent that can weigh up to 140 lb. This intelligent animal can make friends with anyone and gets along well with cats, dogs, and birds. You can easily train your capybara, and it won’t show any resistance or aggression.
- The fennec is the size of a chihuahua, weighs no more than 3 lb, and is getting more and more popular as a pet. It is an extremely friendly creature that’s full of energy.
- Despite being a popular domestic pet, the axolotl is on the verge of total extinction. Catching this amphibian in natural waters is prohibited, but it’s OK to breed it at home.
- Sugar gliders are incredibly affectionate and strongly attached to their owners and the animals they live with. Flying squirrels are nonaggressive, and they respond well to voice intonation and can be trained in simple commands.
- Genets get really attached to their homes. Despite its exotic looks, the genet is unpretentious. Its main needs are regular feedings and a clean tray.
- Hedgehogs are good-natured and have an amazing ability to get used to home conditions quickly. Remember that hedgehogs are predators, and raw meat should be the core of their diet.
- The electric blue crayfish need clean water, a large aquarium, and a place to hide in there.
- The kinkajou is curious and loves following its owner wherever they go, hanging off their shoulders and sitting on their lap. They don’t really make any trouble and easily adapt to a new home.
- Foxes have quite a specific character: they are devoted but independent and very curious, trustful, and playful. Finding a common language with this pet will take a long time, so you have to be patient.
- Skunks are affectionate and very loyal, much like dogs. A tame skunk doesn’t use its fetid weapons at home. The main thing is to regularly comb out the animal and trim its claws.

'I'm ashamed my father was a Capitol Hill rioter' - BBC News,"Over the past five years, Robyn Sweet became more concerned as her father became immersed in far-right conspiracy theories. 

Then she saw the picture of him in handcuffs inside the US Capitol building on 6 January.

Douglas Sweet declined to be interviewed by the BBC.

He is one of hundreds of pro-Trump protesters who stormed the US Capitol four months ago. We look at how many people have been arrested, and ask what punishment they might face.

Lyrics 

I want you
Yeah I want you
And nothing comes close
To the way that I need you
I wish I can feel your skin
And I want you
From somewhere within
It feels like there's oceans
Between me and you once again
We hide our emotions
Under the surface and tryin' to pretend
But it feels like there's oceans
Between you and me
I want you
And I always will
I wish I was worth
But I know what you deserve
You know I'd rather drown
Than to go on without you
But you're pulling me down
It feels like there's oceans
Between you and me once again
We hide our emotions
Under the surface and try to pretend
But it feels like there's oceans
Between you and me
I want you
I want you
And always will
It feels like there's oceans
Between you and me

Italy to require all workers to show Covid pass - BBC News,"Italy is to make it compulsory for all workers to have a Covid ""green pass"" - proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the virus.

The measures are a first for Europe and some of the strictest in the world.

Anyone without a pass will reportedly face suspension from work and may have their pay stopped after five days.

The measure aims to boost vaccinations in a country that has been badly hit by the virus.

Beautiful Undone Lyrics

I took you walking
Through the murmurations of my mind
And I got you talking
About the ones you thought you left behind

You know you’re beautiful undone
Beautiful undone
You look beautiful undone
My boy of blue. 

We’d swap places
We’d ebb and flow
A simple migration
Between us both. 

You know you’re beautiful undone
Beautiful undone
You look beautiful undone
My boy of blue. 

I’m looking down and my heart’s connected
I’m feeling love from a different view
We learn the most when we least expect it 
We learn the most when we break in two 

You know you’re beautiful undone
(Shine on)
Beautiful undone
You look beautiful undone
(Hearts connected)
My boy of blue. 

It’s the cracks that let the light shine
It’s the cracks that let the light shine through.
It’s the cracks that let the light shine
It’s the cracks that let the light shine through. 

It’s the cracks that let the light shine
It’s the cracks that let the light shine
It’s the cracks that let the light shine

Flowerovlove - Get With You (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Flowerovlove - Get With You - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

One great thing about young artists is that their creativity has yet to be tainted by cynicism. This surely applies to Flowerovlove, the alt-pop project of 17-year-old Joyce Cisse, a precocious Brit who started dropping music as Flowerovlove a mere two years ago. “Kiss & Chase '' and “Unseen Miracles,” her first two releases, were marked by wispy clouds of guitar that allowed observational lyrics to shine through. On the more recent “Fat Wave” and “On My Way,” Cisse shows off thorns that prick with the aplomb of fellow London-based ladies Beabadoobee and Baby Queen. Smart outlets like i-D, Notion, and Clash Magazine have gotten behind Flowerovlove's work, and even more attention has arrived as Cisse leans into her fashionista side. This year she not only walked at Paris Fashion Week but also aligned herself in campaigns for brands such as Gucci, Maison Kitsune, and Adidas. That she rapped about the latter experience in her hip-hop foray “Malibu” is another example of the diary-like details weaved into her lyrics. “Paris, Fashion Week/We do that too.” Yeah, no big deal. This year’s “Get With You” is another example of Cisse’s talent for injecting the detached irony of her GenZ phylum into her personal interest in dreamscapes and Magritte-like weirdness (a wonderful surrealism-postmodernism combo percolates through her output, especially in her latest EP, ‘A Mosh Pit In The Clouds’). She once told an interviewer that “you need to serve yourself, otherwise, who will?” It was cool to see that Cisse puts just as much care into her stage act. Angsty emotions chase her in “Get With You.” So she frantically headbangs them away. Conversely, “Out For The Weekend” escapes into blissful hours spent listening to TV Girl with pals, and the sunset orange hues and evening sky purples of our intricate new DSCVR studio lighting setup really turn the performance into something infinite. It’s youth epitomized. Fandom is most fun when the hero has lots of layers, and Flowerovlove is one into which you can really sink your roots.

SUMMARY
Recent research has shown that the brain works better when you can hear the sound of crashing waves, feel the salty breeze and warm sand on your skin, and see all those beautiful shades of blue. That’s why we regain our strength much faster near the ocean. The answer here is either salt therapy, a walk in the forest, or a vacation close to natural bodies of water. And don't forget about going to the beach!

So which one of these revelations did you find the most surprising? Tell us in the comments below!

More than 30 dead in blast in Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif - BBC News,"Dozens of people have been killed or injured in four explosions across Afghanistan on Thursday, local officials and journalists have said.

The first explosion tore through a Shia mosque in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, where at least 30 people were killed and 87 were wounded, the BBC has been told.

The Islamic State group (IS) admitted carrying out the attack. The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a serious security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.

The attack on the Mazar-i-Sharif mosque was carried out using a remotely detonated booby-trapped bag when the building was packed with worshippers, the IS jihadists said.

Secunder Kermani reports on the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country since the Taliban took over.

What If Life Had Never Left the Ocean,"If humans never ditched the ocean life, we'd probably rock some serious aquatic vibes. We might've developed webbed fingers and toes for better swimming and diving, like real-life merfolk! Our skin might be smoother and more streamlined, adapted for gliding through the water with ease. And hey, maybe we'd even sport some gills for breathing underwater, like the coolest fish in the sea. But who knows? Evolution's a wild ride, and maybe one day, we'll uncover what our ocean-dwelling ancestors might've looked like—if they ever existed at all!

The Darién Gap The Most Dangerous Place i have never Seen Before,"The Darién Gap The Most Dangerous Place i have never Seen Before

Much of South America is reeling from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the main reason tens of thousands of people, primarily from Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela, are risking their lives on this dangerous route north. In June, 11,000 migrants entered Panama from Colombia—the highest figure recorded this year despite it being the rainy season, the most dangerous time to cross the Darién Gap. “The Darién [Gap] is like a nightmare, as if you’re in a nightmare with 1,001 demons,” says Óscar, who is from Colombia but was living in Bolivia. “Actually, you find things here that you just can’t imagine.” 

In May, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened programs in Bajo Chiquito—the first village that migrants reach in Panama. Since then, our teams have provided medical and mental health care to more than 14,000 people who have crossed The Darién Gap.

Kelvyn Colt - Moon (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Kelvyn Colt - Moon an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

24-year old Kelvyn Colt is a globetrotting songwriter, rapper and entrepreneur. At this early stage in his career, Kelvyn is already only one small step removed from turning his dreams into reality: In the process of recording his official debut release, he has expanded his back and forth between Berlin and London to LA & NYC. Working on his debut together with the likes of Neff-U (Dr. Dre’s long-standing collaborator and protégé), Bless Beats or The Krautz, Kelvyn’s music is truly postmodern and worldly, combining trap, grime and R&B, alternating between aggressive, sensuous and political modes. It reflects his unique life story in between cultures, and demonstrates his deeply ingrained urge to transcend borders of any kind. If there is one box that Kelvyn Colt could potentially fit into, it would be that of the jack-of-all-trades.

1969 Camaro Build! | DAY 1—Super Chevy Week to Wicked Presented by POL | MotorTrend,"It's day one of our Super Chevy Week to Wicked presented by POL, and one of the biggest goals was to get all the suspension parts and brakes installed under the car. While one team was tackling the front of our 1969 Camaro our group was installing POL's new Lateral X Four-Link system under the F-body. The four-link system has been out for a while, but this new kit is designed for cars that have been mini-tubbed, and it incorporates a cradle assembly that bolts under the back of the car, giving mounting points for suspension bits along with a lot more chassis rigidity. #MotorTrend #WeekToWicked #Camaro",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_RQuoy6aw

Restaurants in Phuket: Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา),"►Looking for restaurants in Phuket? Go here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/phuket-restaurants/
►Read more about this restaurant here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/04/hong-khao-tom-pla-phuket/

There is a lot of good food to eat in Phuket town, and one local restaurant I tried out was a place called Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา), specializing in unique style Thai Chinese food. When we arrived, just after they opened in the afternoon, the restaurant was already pretty busy, and there were plenty of customers eating in and taking away. We chose a table, and proceeded to order a few of the most well known dishes they serve. One thing you’ll immediately notice if you eat at Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา) is that it’s a restaurant with some character. The chef, is a wizard on the wok, and as flames are shooting into the roof from his cooking, he’s barking commands and orders to his staff at the same time - it’s quite an amazing atmosphere.

The first dish I had to try was the talay pad pongari (ทะเลผัดผงกะหรี่), a type of Thai yellow egg curry made with a mixture of seafood. What I immediately loved about it, was that it’s wasn’t oily like it usually is, and yet the curry sauce looked extremely rich and flavorful even without it. The talay pad pongari (ทะเลผัดผงกะหรี่) included a mixture of seafood including fish, shrimp, and squid, withs some shellfish sprinkled in as well. The curry was nicely flavored with yellow curry powder, and had a wonderful fragrance and flavor to it. It was indeed one of the best version of Thai yellow pongari curry I’ve ever had.

Next at Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา) I tried their version of tom yum pla nam sai (ต้มยำปลาน้ำใส), and this was unlike any other version I’ve had in Thailand. It was thick and dark red in color, and teeming with ingredients. While it probably wasn’t as spicy or pungent as it looks, the flavor was indeed incredibly good, it was sour, slightly spicy, and rich with flavor, and there was a nice mixture of fish and mushrooms within the tom yum. I also liked the heavy use of kaffir lime leaves in his recipe. My wife and I also ordered pla pad keun chai (ปลาผัดคึ่นฉ่าย), fish stir fried with Chinese celery - this is one of my standard Thai Chinese dishes, and this time it was done extremely well. The fish was deep fried and then stir fried with lots of ginger and celery, and it had the right saltiness, plus a wonderful smoky flavor from the breath of the wok. Finally, for our last dish at Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา), and to get some more vegetables, we ordered gui chai pad nam man hoy (กุ้ยฉ่ายผัดน้ำมันหอย), which are garlic chives, stir fried with garlic. They were a little on the chew side, but the flavor was excellent, and I love trying all sorts of vegetables.

There are many amazing restaurants in Phuket, and Hong Khao Tom Pla (ฮ้องข้าวต้มปลา) is a very local Phuket style Thai Chinese restaurant that serves some great tasting unique dishes. If you visit Phuket town and are looking for a local food experience, this is a great and interesting restaurant.

British couple charged with espionage in Iran | BBC News,"Detained Britons Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged in Iran with espionage, the country's judiciary news agency has said.
 
Mr and Mrs Foreman were arrested in January but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, emerged last week.
 
Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said that the couple, both aged 52, had ""entered Iran under the guise of tourists"" and ""gathered information in multiple provinces of the country"".
 
The couple had been on a motorbike trip around the world and had planned to stay in Iran for five days.
 
The UK Foreign Office's official advice is against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"".
 
Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds.

Japan’s suicide rate rises during pandemic  - BBC News,"The number of people taking their own lives rose last year for the first time since 2009, Japan's health ministry has said.

Although deaths among men fell slightly, those among women grew by more than 14% and more than 300 children took their own lives in the eight months to November.

""Suicides are the result of many different things, but I think one thing we can definitely say is that there was an impact from the coronavirus on economic and lifestyle factors,"" a ministry official is quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.

Women were said to have been affected worse by increasing unemployment and faced disproportionately more burdens at home, including child supervision.

Where is Russia taking Ukraine's stolen grain? – BBC News,"Russian forces have been repeatedly accused of stealing grain from Ukrainian farmers in occupied areas as well as other crops such as sunflower seeds, along with fertiliser and agricultural equipment.

The UN is warning of famine in Africa and the Middle East because of the disruption to supplies from Ukraine, which is one of the world's biggest wheat producers.

Moscow denies accusations of theft, but Russian installed authorities have been found to be issuing decrees saying they are “nationalising” Ukrainian grain.

Why Japanese Trains Surprise Tourists So Much,"One of the most amazing things about Japan is its railway. See for yourself: 45 of the 50 busiest railway stations on this planet are in Japan. And it’s not surprising. Japan’s progress does not stop with technology, it also affects the comfort level of people’s lives and Japanese trains are a vivid example of convenience. Let's have a look at the most popular ones!

SUMMARY:
- Sunrise Express consists of two trains, Sunrise Izumo and Sunrise Seto. They’re combined on their way from Tokyo to Okayama, then split up and travel to two different places.
- Unlike most modern trains, Sunrise Express has not one or two, but six types of accommodations! 
- Let's say you don't want to spend a fortune on your privacy, or you're going to travel with a companion. In this case, you can opt for class B which offers passengers different kinds of accommodations.
- Sunrise Express has everything you may need to have a comfortable trip. There are enough toilets to take an early morning bathroom trip without getting stuck in a restroom line. 
- There's one important thing you should remember unless you're traveling in a first class Single Deluxe compartment. If you want to take a shower, you need to buy a special card. 
- Shinkansen's operating speed can reach 200 miles per hour! But according to test runs in 2003, Shinkansen can increase its speed up to 361 miles per hour! 
- The train has been running for almost 55 years and has already carried more than 10 billion passengers.
- All Japanese high-speed trains have an automatic emergency brake system that comes into action in case of an earthquake. 
- The world's busiest train station is Shinjuku which has more than 3.6 million visitors.
- The longest train that runs upside down is also in Japan. To see this wonder, you need to travel an hour outside of Tokyo, where you'll find yourself in a beachy prefecture called Chiba. 
- There is so much train fandom in the country that train lovers separate into numerous groups, from those whose hobby is to walk around train stations to those who can't live without train lunch boxes.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

LYRICS:
Are you burnt out  
On religious things  
Are you worn down  
Lacking inner peace  
Take a real rest  
Walk along with Me  
In the pastures of My presence 
You can be yourself and you can  
  
Say what’s on your heart  
I already know it all 
Doesn’t matter what you say 
Come and getaway with Me  
I know where you are  
Where you’ve been and what you’ve seen  
Doesn’t matter how you come  
Come and get away with Me 
Getaway, getaway with Me  

Are you burdened  
From all the heavy days  
It’s not your job  
To shoulder all the weight  
Let Me do it  
Let Me come and take 
The lies you’ve been believing in 
The truth is that you have a place to  

Grace upon grace upon grace  
Let it lead  
Getaway, getaway with Me 
Grace upon grace upon grace  
Let it lead  
Getaway, getaway with Me 
Grace upon grace upon grace  
Let it lead  
Getaway, getaway with Me 
Grace upon grace upon grace  
Let Me lead  
Getaway, getaway with Me

SUMMARY
-“Saving a penny” can give you quite a result. Putting aside even $50 a year will help you build up a $500 emergency fund to help you if you suddenly lose your income.
-Give yourself 24 hours to think things through before buying something.
-Put aside a fixed amount of money for every bad habit that you have.
-“Pay yourself first” is a method that includes paying a part of your wage to yourself before you spend it on anything else.
-Make yourself a promise that you'll buy only necessities for the next 30 days. And this means that you have to make some changes in your everyday life too: walk or bike to work rather than driving, eat simpler homemade food, take lunch to work daily, or cut down your entertainment expenses by going for a walk in the park or exploring your city instead.
-Buy and save method is simple: you put aside a percentage of every purchase you make.
-Save a larger amount every week than you saved the week before. For example, start with $5. Next week, put aside $10, and then $15.

Beirut blast: Explosion rocks city ahead of Hariri verdict - BBC News,"A large blast has hit the Lebanese capital, Beirut, ahead of the verdict in a trial for the killing of ex-PM Rafik Hariri in 2005.

Reports say the explosion was in the port area of the city, with unconfirmed reports of a second blast.

Video showed a large mushroom cloud and extensive damage.

A UN tribunal is due to issue its verdict in the trial in absentia of four suspects in the murder by car bomb of Rafik Hariri.

All four are members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, which has consistently denied any role in Hariri's death.

The possible second explosion was reported to be at the Hariri residence in the city.

Dozens have been injured, AFP news agency reports, quoting a security source.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-NnjZayMVg

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020!

Amanda said: “These communities have a special relationship with the ocean because fishing has been in their families for centuries; the ocean is in their blood. However, the industrial fishing industry is robbing them of their livelihoods and destroying their way of life, and they’ve had enough! From Thailand to Senegal, they’re taking a stand against corporations plundering the oceans for profit, stealing food from their tables, and leaving their families to go hungry.

The true scale of clerical sex abuse in Italy - BBC News,"The BBC has uncovered how a culture of complicity and denial conceals the true scale of sex abuse by Catholic priests in Italy. 

Despite having the highest number of priests of any country, and the seat of the Catholic Church in its backyard, Italy keeps no official statistics on clerical sex abuse and there's been no public inquiry.

The BBC has seen documents that lay out the extent of abuse and cover up by the Catholic Church and the Italian state. 

This video contains descriptions which viewers may find upsetting.

Calvin Harris - My Way (Lyrics)

Why wait 
To say
At least I did it my way 
Lie awake 
Two faced 
But in my heart I understand 
I made 
My move 
And it was all about you 
Now I feel 
So far removed 

You were the one thing in my way 

My way
Away away away""",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Bj7Zb-YD4

UN climate talks 'no longer fit for purpose' say key experts | BBC News,"The United Nations' COP climate talks are ""no longer fit for purpose"" and need an urgent overhaul, key experts, including a former UN climate chief, have said.

This week the Azerbaijani president told world leaders gathered in his country for COP29 that natural gas was a “gift from God” and he shouldn’t be blamed for bringing it to market.

Exiled Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain | BBC News,"Police in Barcelona are hunting for the separatist former leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, who made a dramatic return to Spain after a seven-year exile despite facing an outstanding arrest warrant.

For much of the past several years he has lived in Brussels, after police indicted him on charges linked to a failed bid for independence in 2017.

Mr Puigdemont briefly addressed hundreds of supporters who gathered near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona, shortly ahead of the expected investiture of a new head of the Catalan government.

He said he had returned ""to remind you that we are still here"" and that ""holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime.""

LYRICS:
No North Face couldn't warm me up
Been feeling somewhat in a rut
Driving on the fuel light for a week
You're like coffee in a solo cup
The vessel isn't strong enough
That feels like it's a metaphor for me

Only thing I'm missing is some kindling and a light
Tell you I surrender but it’s feeling trite
Cause I think I lost my desire
So set me on fire
Set me on fire

I’ve been tryna part with my complacence
Think I might be getting places
Finally see the forest for the trees
So I’m cutting ties and turning pages
Not a cult but it’s adjacent
Still a couple flowers in the weeds


Tryna take it easy but my ego never tires
Tryna build the kingdom but is it Yours or mine?
Tell me whose name’s getting higher
When I’m writing mine on a flier

Set me on fire
Fire fall down
Fire fall down on us we pray
So set me on fire
Set me on fire
Set me on

Self-Managed Abortion: How Many Weeks Pregnant Am I? | Episode 2,"In Episode 2 of our series on safe abortion, learn how to calculate how many weeks along your pregnancy is from your last missed period and what you can do if you no longer wish to continue the pregnancy. This video is part of an eight-chapter instructional series co-produced by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and HowToUseAbortionPill.org. The intention behind these videos is to help ensure that abortion with pills is conducted in a safe, accessible, secure, and respectful manner.

Video transcript: 
Lesson 2: How many weeks is my pregnancy? 
If you are pregnant but don’t want to be, you may decide to have an abortion. 1 in every 3 women will have an abortion in their lifetime.  

The length of your pregnancy will help determine how to safely and effectively undergo an abortion with pills. Estimating the length of a pregnancy is simple, though often misunderstood. If you have a calendar on hand, you can use it for reference. 

First, think back to the last time you got your menstrual period. What day did the bleeding start? If you’re using a calendar, circle that date. Then count the number of weeks and days from that day until today’s date. This is how many weeks and days your pregnancy is. 

Let’s use an example. Meet Sofia. Sofia’s last menstrual period began on September 13th, and today’s date is October 28th. How far along is her pregnancy? 

To find out, Sofia marks September 13th on her calendar and begins to count the number of weeks until October 28th. She counts from September 13th to September 20th as one week, from September 20th to September 27th as two weeks, from September 27th to October 4th as three weeks, and so on. She continues like this until she reaches October 25th, which she marks as 6 weeks. Since there are no more full weeks between October 25th and 28th, Sofia counts by days. October 26th counts as one day, October 27th counts as two days, and October 28th counts as three days. This means that Sofia is 6 weeks and three days pregnant. 

If you are not sure when your last menstrual period was, you can also go to a health care facility to get an ultrasound to estimate how many weeks pregnant you are. But an ultrasound is not mandatory before having an abortion with pills. 

Keep in mind that it is not always necessary to know the exact number of weeks or days pregnant that you are. As long as you are less than 13 weeks pregnant, you can safely and effectively have an abortion with pills as described in this video course.  

In our next video, we answer the question, “How does an abortion with pills work?”

HEX - Canadian Drip (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Hex - Canadian Drip - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Simply dubbed by many as ""the UK's answer to Post Malone"", this comparison doesn't tell the whole story for Hex, an artist pushing boundaries with his slick genre fluid music. Dropping tunes fusing Rap, R&B and Afrobeats alongside a distinct visual signature, the Nottingham-born artist deserves way more recognition than just one simplistic comparison. His gritty, dark and often melodic sounds are ushering in a new wave for UK hip-hop. Stand out track ""Stunna"" showcases Hex's ability to create beats that seem beyond his years, a certified rap/R&B banger that wouldn't look out of place on the Hot 100. With collaborations with alt-j and Yungen already in the bag, the hype just isn't going to end for Hex. This is an artist that's going to dominate 2019, shaking off the comparisons and make waves in his own style.

Mr Sadr's political alliance won the most seats in last October's general election, but it is not in power due to political deadlock following the vote.
 
Police reportedly fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters and Iraq's current prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, called on crowds to leave the building.

35 CAR HACKS THAT MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE AND MONEY,"IMPORTANT CAR HACKS

Here's some information for you to think over: Undoubtedly the most dangerous type of transport is automobile.
Because of the sheer number of drivers on the road, there are more opportunities for accidents and fatalities. In 2014, the Department of Transportation reported 32,675 automobile fatalities, making highway travel the deadliest form of travel in America. 

So these car hacks and safety tips may be awfully beneficial for all the car lovers out there!

The main problem with traffic jams are drivers:
their slow reactions and lack of attention, traffic jams occur not only at junctions but also on highways when someone suddenly cuts across the road or a car quickly changes lanes.

So HOW CAN YOU AVOID TRAFFIC JAMS?

DON'T move out onto a crossing if you'll be forced to stop there.

RETAIN the same distance between cars both ahead and behind.

DON'T drive right up close to others - this can cause not only traffic jams but also accidents.

Check out 9 GOLDEN RULES OF PARKING:

9. Park in reverse to make it easier to leave.

8. Before parking, make sure there's nothing behind you.

7. Leave a space to allow other cars to get past.

6. Position your car in a way that doesn't empede pedestrians.

5. Don't block in other cars.

4. Don't park in the second lane, otherwise you'll cause a traffic jam.

3. If there aren't any markings, park parallel to the neighboring vehicle.

2. When leaving, give a signal to other drivers.

1. Park where it's permitted. Otherwise, you won't find your car later on.

Drive safe, my friends! ;)

Charlotte Plank - Ellen (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025,"Charlotte Plank - Ellen | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

“I was born in Australia with my parents being in the rave scene there,” Charlotte Plank recently recounted on our DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025 set. “My uncle was a DJ. So I was brought up in a lot of ravey, acid house music.” The Brit producer/singer’s musical journey is a cool spin on the familiar story of parents as primary tastemakers for their kids. It’s just that not a lot of moms and dads are blasting 808 State at the crib. Unsurprisingly, Plank herself turned into one cool cat, first becoming a disciple of Rudimental and Amy Winehouse, before immersing herself in the UK dance scene, before eventually plying her own craft. During the pandemic she built beats on Logic. Early releases like “Lost Boys” and “Hate Me” showed her skillful hand at the flurrying sounds of drum and bass. Plank also casts a wide net, as best demonstrated on her debut album, 2023’s ‘InHer World,’ which grabs pieces of indie rock riffs, jazz, blues, and hyperpop. We particularly love that she considers herself “a writer, before anything else.” In the midst of the genre’s mad energy, Charlotte’s voice has a way of cutting through the fray. It’s probably because she’s the rare EDM artist who has something to say with lyrics. Surely, the Plank parents are already cheering on their girl. After all, she’s checked off one dream by collaborating with Rudimental on “Dancing is Healing.” These performances of “Ellen” and “Stargirl,” which transformed our studio into the club, will only increase their pride.

Lyrics: 

Wake up and breathe in deeper than yesterday 
Take on the morning like your soul’s been remade 
Roll down the windows let your cares fly away 
Good things are yours to claim you don’t have to wait 

All across the sky 
New mercies rise 
And the future’s bright 

This is a new day 
Everything bursting with hope 
Coming alive in this moment, moment 
You’ve got a freedom 
No looking back anymore 
Open your eyes, it’s coming, coming 
This is a new day 
The old has gone away 
The old has gone away 
This is a new day 
Don’t let it slip away 
Don’t let it slip away 

Go on and reignite impossible dreams 
Become the one you never thought you could be 
Love hasn’t give up on you 
Love hasn’t give up on you 
Love is making the old things new 
Today and every single day

'Our Irish island is the last stop before America' - BBC News,"A couple from Dublin has left city life behind to take up residence on one of Ireland’s most remote Islands.

The Great Blasket Island is off the cost of County Kerry and is the most westerly point in Europe.

In recent years a number of the houses have been restored and tourists have been welcomed back to the island.

An advertisement for two vacancies as caretakers attracted more than 23,000 applications from around the world.

The successful candidates were Eoin Boyle and Annie Birney from Dublin.

Ms Birney says it’s still sinking in.

“Every morning we wake up and there is a massive seal colony on the beach right on our doorstep and the next thing you look out your window and a donkey is walking past, you don’t know what you’ll see next.”

The couple will live in accommodation on the island until October and run the island's coffee shop and private cottages.

LIFE BEFORE AND AFTER SMARTPHONES,"THE WORLD BEFORE SMARTPHONES
 
Have you ever wondered how life was before cell phones? Today we can’t imagine our lives without having a phone being in touch every single minute. We use a lot of messages, socials and always know what is happening around the world. Today, it’s easier to carry on relationships texting and only a few people still call each other. Messaging takes less time and you can do whatever you want while this process. Before we used paper maps and asked people for directions. Now we have lot’s of navigation maps and there is no need to communicate to strangers. Only ten years ago receiving a letter was something special, now we have lots of spam. On the other hand, you can be in touch with your friends from other countries all the time. 
 The amount of time we spend staring at screens has increased dramatically in the last few years and even parent and kids do not spend a lot of time together. They always watch shows, check Instagram and play games. Don’t forget to spend time without a phone and have fun together! Smartphones make our lives a lot easier, but do not spend too much time on your phone as I could be harmful to your health and relationships. 
 One more collection of hilarious scenes is about funny cell phone moments. Low battery is a really scary situation especially if you are out shopping and need to call your friend to meet. Panic! Do not forget to check your battery or take a power bank with you all the time. Do you have an annoying friend who always makes a lot of photos of food? I have one!

Spain beat England to win Women's World Cup - BBC News,"Spain have beaten England 1-0 in a tense Women's World Cup final.

Olga Carmona's strike on the half-hour mark was enough to earn victory for La Roja on their first appearance in a Women's World Cup final.

China's secret 'brainwashing' camps - BBC News,"Leaked documents detail for the first time China's systematic brainwashing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in a network of high-security prison camps.

The Chinese government has consistently claimed the camps in the far western Xinjiang region offer voluntary education and training.

But official documents, seen by BBC Panorama, show how inmates are locked up, indoctrinated and punished.

China's UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming dismissed the documents as fake news. He said the measures had safeguarded local people and there had not been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years.

""In total disregard of the facts, some people in the West have been fiercely slandering and smearing China over Xinjiang in an attempt to create an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs, disrupt China's counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang and thwart China's steady development,"" he said.

The leak was made to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which has worked with 17 media partners, including BBC Panorama and The Guardian newspaper in the UK.

Lyrics: 

I’ve built up my own name
But the walls couldn’t stand 
I’ve trusted my own strength 
But it was sinking sand 
So I put my ruins 
Into Your hands 
And watch You restore them
Like only You can 

Cause if the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
If the Lord builds the house 
Nobody can tear it down
When it’s built on His name 
There’s nothing gonna shake this ground 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
 
The bricks may be weathered 
Through storm and through fire
But what God holds together
It stands firm every time
Cause my life is anchored
On this solid truth
That whatever God's building
No it can’t be moved
 
Cause if the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
If the Lord builds the house 
Nobody can tear it down
When it’s built on His name 
There’s nothing gonna shake this ground 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
Oh nobody
 
As for me and my house 
We’re gonna serve You Lord
So here’s the keys 
Come on in
Everything we have is Yours
 
As for me and my house 
We’re gonna serve You Lord
So here’s the keys 
Come on in
Everything we have is Yours
 
Oh
Here’s the keys 
Won’t You come on in
Everything we have is Yours
 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can (tear it down)
Nobody can tear it down
(If the Lord builds the house) 
Nobody can tear it down
When it’s built on His name 
There’s nothing gonna shake this ground 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
When it’s built on His name 
There’s nothing that can shake this ground 
If the Lord builds the house
Nobody can tear it down
 
I said if the Lord builds the house 
Nobody can tear it down

The controversial candidates in the Philippines presidential election - BBC News,"The Philippines is holding presidential elections on 9 May and they are set to be highly controversial.

Among the main candidates are the daughter of the country's notorious outgoing president, the son of a former dictator and a world-famous boxer.

The presidential election will take place on Monday alongside elections for Congress and regional governments.

The key election issues are how to revive the country's economy from a sharp recession brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, and how to stamp out corruption in public office.

Inside 'world's most dangerous' hospital in Guatemala,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
***This report contains some disturbing images*** An undercover BBC investigation into conditions at a mental health institution in Guatemala has revealed patient suffering and abuse at the hands of those meant to care for them. Federico Mora Hospital has been described by campaigners as the world's most abusive and dangerous mental health institution. In 2012, Guatemala was ordered by an American Human Rights Commission to make emergency improvements to the Federico Mora Hospital to ""save lives"". The government promised to comply. But an undercover BBC investigation found little has changed. The government defends conditions in the hospital, says it has begun improving mental health care in the country and has ordered an investigation into sexual abuse claims. Report by Chris Rogers

WE  Will Really Appreciate Your Feedback . 
'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Keep Standing With Refugees; We Will, Too!

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

It started out like any other trip home…,"Sign the petition calling for a global network of ocean sanctuaries to protect turtles’ homes: https://act.gp/2FQUTxq
--
Our oceans are under threat from overfishing, climate change, plastic and oil drilling. Six out of seven sea turtle species are threatened with extinction.

But there is hope for our blue planet: a vast network of ocean sanctuaries. 

For this to be possible we need a strong Global Ocean Treaty negotiated at the UN next year. People around the world are working together to make this a reality. Join the movement: https://act.gp/2FQUTxq

Turtle Journey was created by Greenpeace and Aardman Animations (Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep), and features special guests Helen Mirren, Olivia Colman, Ahir Shah, Bella Ramsey, David Harbour, Jim Carter and Giovanna Lancellotti.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. #Vanlife was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFRUFGazJnc
Myanmar police 'told to shoot' coup protesters - BBC News,"Police officers from Myanmar have told the BBC they fled across the border into India after refusing to carry out the orders of the military which seized power in a coup last month. 

More than a dozen defectors told us they escaped, fearing they'd be forced to kill or harm civilians.

For nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety - served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma. ""I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't,"" he said.

Now, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram.

33 CRAZY TOILET HACKS,"TOILET HACKS

Do you sit on the toilet correctly?
In the wrong position intestine is pinched and blocked!

In the squatting position puborectalis muscle is relaxed, colon is straigheted out. In the animal world this is the most natural position.

Use a prop for your legs to sit at a right angle.

No matter who we are or where we live - we all experience the unpleasantness of a clogged toilet every so often. With this oh-so-clever trick, you'll be back to smooth sailing before you know it!

In the video below, I'll demonstrate the unclogging process by first covering the entire opening of the toilet with two layers of plastic wrap. After ensuring that the plastic wrap is fastened tightly to the bowl, flush the toilet. Doing this should cause the layer of plastic wrap to ""balloon."" Gently and slowly push down on the plastic wrap - the suction should help to force the clogged material down. Enjoy your restroom time!  : )


Magnetic knife strips are really handy for bathroom stuff! They allow for the removal of that huge mess on your countertop, freeing up valuable space. They allow for easy access to your clippers and brushes as you can mount them pretty much wherever you want. Plus, they look really cool, too!

The only bad thing about magnetic knife strips is that they usually cost upwards of 30 dollars for good ones. 30 dollars?! That is way too much for this DIY. So, I've come up with a way to make homemade knife strips on the cheap!

Materials:
Strip of wood
Sticky-backed magnet roll
Screws
Scissors

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Stuart Russell is a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a co-author of the book that introduced me and millions of other people to AI, called Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Boris Johnson urges “extreme caution” as England lockdown eased - BBC News,"The British Prime minister has urged extreme caution as England's lockdown begins to be lifted. 

Boris Johnson said he hoped this would be the last lockdown but the public must continue to obey the rules and the vaccines need to remain effective. 

After three months of lockdown, people in England can now visit family and friends outside their local area as long as they stay outdoors.   

Outdoor sports facilities like tennis courts can re-open but holidays abroad are still banned. 

More than half the adult population has now been vaccinated in the UK. But there's still concern about the impact of a third wave of infections across the EU.

KILLER DISEASES   Mapping Tuberculosis,"Please  Subscribe: MSF International Channel  For Humanity   🆘
Your Comments  And Likes is Your  Feedback.
We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYHZUlK7ck

What If We Colonized the Ocean Floor?,"Imagine if humans could live on the ocean floor! We'd have entire underwater cities with domes and tunnels, surrounded by sea creatures. It could help solve overcrowding on land, giving us new space to live. But it wouldn’t be easy—building homes to withstand the deep-sea pressure would be a huge challenge. We’d also need to figure out how to get food, oxygen, and energy down there. It sounds super cool, but colonizing the ocean floor would definitely take some serious science and technology!

Why Steve Jobs Didn't Have a License Plate,"What do you know about Steve Jobs, the legendary co-founder of Apple, who created one of the greatest gadgets of our time? Turns out, he was a man of mystery, and in the most literal sense of the word. Just think about it, he'd been driving a car around Silicon Valley without a license plate for years on end! That meant breaking the law, which requires all passenger vehicles to have tags.

Some believed that he did it just because he could. Call it a rebellious spirit if you want. Or maybe he wanted to protect his privacy by any means possible. Someone even came up with the theory that it was the font on the plate that he didn’t like. After all, he was a perfectionist in every way, so maybe he really thought an ugly plate would ruin his beautiful car.

SUMMARY:
- A few years back, California laws allowed people to drive with no plates for six months after buying a new car. So Jobs just made the most of this loophole.
- The interesting thing is that all this time he stayed true to one brand and model, the Mercedes SL55 AMG. 
- He was often on a diet with only one ore two specific types of food allowed. For instance, he would eat nothing but apples for weeks. 
- He also didn’t think he ever got body odor, so he didn’t see the need to shower every day, or use deodorant. 
- Ingvar Kamprad, who created IKEA, had billions of dollars in his account. But still, he lived just like any other person. 
- Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the US, loved air baths. Every morning before work, he'd open the windows in his house to let the chill in. 
- Bill Gates has an unusual method of focusing on his ideas. To help him think, he sits down in a rocking chair and quietly swings back and forth. 
- Inventor Thomas Edison was also incredibly picky about his employees, but in another way. To work for him, a person needed to pass the salt test. 
- Howard Hughes was terrified of germs so much he couldn’t even touch his silverware without wrapping it in tissues first. 
- Brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla, detested bacteria. He wore gloves at almost all times, and didn’t shake hands with anyone. 
- Business magnate Warren Buffett also has a pretty time-consuming habit. He reads 500 pages every day.
- Stephen King revealed that he can’t start writing without a slice of cheesecake.
- As for industrialist Henry Ford, his favorite snack was… roadside greens. And when he had guests, he served them soybean sandwiches and burdock.

Rescuers at the Ready: NASA Team Completes Artemis Emergency Egress System Demonstration,"Teams with NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Program at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center completed an emergency egress system demonstration throughout the course of several days at Launch Complex 39B ahead of the Artemis II test flight that will carry four astronauts around the Moon.

The EGS team practiced emergency procedures during day and nighttime launch scenarios with the closeout crew, the team responsible for helping the astronauts get inside the Orion spacecraft, and the Pad Rescue team, which would aid personnel away from the launch pad in an emergency.

While the crew and other personnel will ride the emergency egress baskets in a real emergency, no one rode the baskets for this test. Instead, teams tested the baskets during separate occasions by using water tanks filled to different levels to replicate simulate the weight of passengers.

Bake and Shark!! #1 FAST FOOD in Trinidad and Tobago - Maracas Bay!!,"🌶️ Get Smoked Ghost Pepper: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper (Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ)

TRINIDAD & TOBAGO - Another amazing day in Trinidad and Tobago and today we’re doing a few things, starting with a unique roast fish and cheesy lobster, then going into the mountains to learn about Trinidad chocolate, and finally finishing with the most famous fast food in Trinidad - bake and shark at Maracas Bay!

Big thank you to #TrinidadandTobago #visitTrinidad for inviting me to Trinidad and Tobago and for making this trip happen! Guide to the things and food in this video: https://visittrinidad.tt/things-to-do/cuisine/mayaro-brasso-seco-maracas-bay-in-trinidad-with-mark-wiens/

Dr. Roast Fish (https://goo.gl/maps/mxTmfzw22xt8utx98) - Mayaro, Trinidad - We’re starting on the East Coast of Trinidad, and going to meet up with Dr. Roast, who is famous for his roast fish. And Trinbagonian roast fish is something very unique and his recipe is different from any other roast fish I’ve seen. He loaded up the fish with corn, plantains, green seasonings, and cheese to top it off! We also had a lobster covered in green seasoning, and topped with cheese again. Very nice guy and fresh seafood!

Brasso Seco Village (http://www.brassosecoparia.com/) - Next we drove into the mountains to Brass Seco Village. They have an indigenous population and they offer a number of eco friendly tourism opportunities like visiting the cacao plantations and seeing the entire process of how chocolate is made. It was a great learning experience, and eating the fresh cacao fruit was the highlight. We also had a quick lunch, a local meal and some Trinidadian dishes like smoked chicken in coconut milk.

Uncle Sam & Sons (https://g.page/UncleSamsTT?share) - Finally to complete this food tour today, we headed to the most famous beach in all of the island - Maracas Bay! Along with the beach, you can’t go to Maracas Bay without eating Bake and Shark. The bake is more of a fried bread and the shark is real local shark meat that’s seasoned and breaded, then deep fried and loaded into the bake. Finally, you add all your own toppings like pepper sauce, shadow beni, and pineapple. The best thing to do is then go stand or sit on the beach to enjoy the most famous and iconic beach food in Trinidad and Tobago!

A New Continent Is Discovered on Earth In the Pacific Ocean,"How to Stop Water Polution. In case you're wondering what water polution has to do with a new continent discoevered in the Pacific Ocean, here's the answer to this mystery. This new continent is an island that consists solely of garbage and plastic waste. Some countries are ready to announce an ecological disaster. Let’s see if there’s something we can all do to save the planet.

https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

SUMMARY
-2 million plastic bags a minute are thrown away. As for bubble wrap, the amount produced in just one year would be enough to cover our planet around the equator. 500 billion plastic cups are used and disposed of annually.
-There are 3 huge garbage islands in the world: in the central North Pacific Ocean, in the Indian Ocean, and in the Atlantic Ocean. 
-The size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is currently more than 600,000 square miles. According to the journal Scientific Reports, there are more than 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that have accumulated in this area.
-Plastic objects in the ocean kill animals or get stuck in their bodies. Some types of plastic are toxic. In addition, plastic has the ability to absorb such poisonous substances as mercury. Birds often choke to death after trying to swallow a bright object that has caught their eye.
-Indonesian authorities have recently declared a “garbage emergency.” More than 100 tons of waste brought ashore every day to beaches from Seminyak and Jimbaran to Kuta.
-To solve the problem, people can find a way to remove the garbage that is already in the ocean. Another way out is to decrease pollution or stop it completely.

Mr Zelensky told soldiers, ""I want to thank each of you for your service.""

Later, he sacked the local security chief for ""not defending"" the city.

Judge refuses to halt parliament suspension plans - BBC News,"A Scottish judge has refused to order a temporary halt to Boris Johnson's plan to shut down the UK Parliament.

A group of 75 parliamentarians were seeking an interim interdict - similar to an injunction - at the Court of Session ahead of a full hearing.

Their request was declined by Lord Doherty, who said he was not satisfied there was a ""cogent need"" for an interdict.

But the full hearing will now be heard next Tuesday, rather than Friday.

Lord Doherty told the court that it was in the interest of justice, and in the public interest, that the case proceeds sooner rather than later.

The prime minister wants to suspend parliament for several weeks ahead of a Queen's Speech on 14 October. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October.

The cross-party group of politicians involved in the case, including SNP MP Joanna Cherry and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, want the court to rule that it would be illegal and unconstitutional for him to do so.

The experiment has been organised by a group campaigning for a shorter working week, but for no loss in wages.

During the trial, employees will get 100% pay for 80% of the hours they would usually work, with the aim of being more productive.

thuy - dumb luck (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"thuy - dumb luck - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

When crafting a track, or delivering a performance, some artists are able to conjure two or three emotions at once. Turns out thuy has such skills; when she’s really on her game, the LA-based R&B singer imbues a tune with a variety of feelings that enrich the experience. In a flash she can come off as assured, nonchalant, poised, or vulnerable. It’s quite a feat, and it makes her new ‘girls like me don’t cry’ a must-hear. Adored by the singer’s ever-growing audience, tracks such as “trust” and “playing tricks” follow the success of “universe” and “chances” from last year’s ‘i hope u see this’ debut. A Vietnamese heritage and Bay Area background enhance a cosmopolitan confidence, and with a vocal agility that conjures Ariana Grande, thuy has numerous ways of bringing lyrics to life. Like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, pop icons she grew up idolizing, her performances are unique yet natural – she truly communicates with her listeners. She’s felt this power in herself for years; early on, her “Hands On Me” took top honors at a regional radio show’s talent contest, and her yen to be a performer started to take hold. But a life in music is risky to say the least, one reason why this well-rounded dreamer went to school, walked away with a degree in medicine, and took a job at Stanford. That pleased her parents, but the itch to create never fully left her, and little by little she returned to music with a parade of individual tracks, each one catchier than the previous. A few years ago, “All Night Long” went viral and thuy became a thing for sure. It’s been a steady progression since, and proud of her heritage, she’s also become a vocal advocate for the AAPI community. When you see her move through our Artists To Watch performance of “dumb luck” from ‘girls like me don’t cry,’ you’ll know she’s not shy about putting herself forward.

"Update from #Lebanon: ""The humanitarian situation is indescribable""","We received this audio from Luna Hammad, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical coordinator in Lebanon. As large-scale Israeli bombardment continues in Lebanon, up to 1 million people have been forced from their homes in a desperate search for safety. People are sleeping in cars on the streets and hospitals are overwhelmed with the wounded. Over 500 schools are full. Our teams are working around the clock to provide support to displaced people in shelters, including schools, in the south of Lebanon as well as in and around #Beirut. We’re providing water, psychological first aid, medical consultations, and donating essential items such as mattresses, blankets, drinking water, and hygiene kits to #displaced people. Our teams continue to assess the needs and deliver help. 

As the Israeli bombardment campaign of Lebanon continues, we reiterate our call that civilians and health care workers must be protected. #news  #worldnews   #doctorswithoutborders",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOVkE4BLavc

Rubik Cube: The man behind world's most popular puzzle - BBC News,"It is a toy, it is a puzzle and, according to its creator, it is also a piece of art In 1974, Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik created his eponymous Cube as a teaching tool for his students. His students loved playing with the Cube which inspired him to make it more widely available. Forty years on, the Cube has sold 350 million copies making it the most popular puzzle of all time. Initially, Mr Rubik was not dreaming of mass production or phenomenal sales figures. He did not even have a solution for his own puzzle. It took him a month to work out how to solve it. He told Witness about the inspiration for his invention and how it took the world by storm. Witness, the stories of our times told by the people who were there.

Donald Knuth is one of the greatest and most impactful computer scientists and mathematicians ever. He is the recipient in 1974 of the Turing Award, considered the Nobel Prize of computing. He is the author of the multi-volume work, the magnum opus, The Art of Computer Programming. He made several key contributions to the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms. He popularized asymptotic notation, that we all affectionately know as the big-O notation. He also created the TeX typesetting which most computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and scientists and engineers use to write technical papers and make them look beautiful.

India election 2019: Can you only win votes with bad economics? - BBC News,"India's political parties have made many big promises in this election season - and most of them have focused on the economy. 

The country has enjoyed fast growth for years, but there are concerns it is headed for a slowdown. So how many of these promises are realistic? And do promises that win votes have to equal bad economics?

How TikTok is changing Colombia’s view of cocaine production - BBC News,"TikTok videos have opened a new window into Colombia’s illegal, cocaine producing industry as coca workers share videos about their daily lives.

The videos show people working in the fields and in processing labs, who see their involvement in the industry as the only way to escape poverty.

Colombia will vote in presidential elections next year and what to do about cocaine production will be one of the key issues for the candidates. 

These videos could shift the debate and make Colombians question who exactly the enemy is in Colombia’s war on drugs

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Roof of New York firehouse collapses under heavy snow. #NewYork #BBCNews,,News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRDWx23DoQA
What If Sea Creatures Could Fly Suddenly,"You're woken up by a strange sound. It's a knock on the window. But you live on the 12th floor – who, or what could be knocking? The knocking is getting stronger. You go to the window, reach for the curtain, and abruptly pull it aside... What you see is fantastic. There are flying (or floating) small fish outside your window. 1000s of them! A shoal of sardines rising directly to the sky. A few knock on your window as they pass. There are so many sardines, you can't see what's going on outside. But as the last fish flies by, the full picture opens before you.

Large and small fish fly between the houses. Octopuses cut through the air with their tentacles into a rain cloud. A huge whale is slowly drifting toward the horizon. Above the roof of a nearby house, two sharks chase four sea lions. A neighbor waves to you. He holds a fishing rod from the window and waits for the fish to bite. A school--no, a flock--of dolphins flies past your window. They cheerfully whistle, as if they are greeting you. What's going on? Sea creatures of the Earth have learned to fly, leaving the ocean and filling the air! Yup, it's one of those crazy what-if scenarios you like so much!

Iraq: Islamic State inside Mosul - BBC News,"It's a city where entire districts have been emptied of people and where ancient sites have been systematically destroyed. Now, a year after Iraq's second city Mosul was captured by the militant group calling themselves Islamic State, we have an exclusive and unique investigation into how deeply entrenched the terror group is in the city. The BBC looks at how the militants control most aspects of daily life, including dress codes and schools, which residents say are used to indoctrinate children. And as this report shows, many are living in fear of being punished according to the group's extreme interpretation of Islamic law.

Why Are Hardworking Brits Without Homes While Migrants Receive Free Benefits,"British citizens are working hard paying taxes and yet they can't even afford a home But the same basically is given free to the illegal migrants who are entering into the country from the day one I mean they are given forced hotel facilities NHS facilities dentist facilities refugees loans and what not all paid by the basically hardworking taxpayer and it has not changed basically from the last successive governments situation is getting actually from bad to worse and there's also basically a growing sense of frustration among the people who feels that the government is actually ignoring them I think government really need to think about it that the hardworking people paying taxes can't afford the facilities and they have been given free to the people who are coming from other countries without contributing anything

"Six killed in 'most massive' Russian air attack, Ukraine says | BBC News","Russia has launched one of its biggest air attacks on Ukraine of the war so far, the head of the Ukrainian air force has said.

At least six people were killed and dozens wounded as missiles and drones were fired into more than half of Ukraine's regions on Monday.

Power infrastructure was hit, causing widespread blackouts, as the entire country was put under air raid alert and told to take shelter.

Russia confirmed it had launched attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - one of its long-term tactics - and said all its targets were hit.

According to Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of Ukraine's air force, Russia launched 127 missiles and 109 attack drones.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

What If Animals Were As Smart As Us,"The emotional lives of animals are often questioned by us. But it's not just us who run things on this planet. Due to the subjective nature of emotions, many think that they are out of the reach of scientific measurement for animals. But what if all mammals, both living on land and in sea, suddenly gained intelligence and could communicate? They'd probably have a lot to tell us...

Jade Bird - Uh Huh (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"It could be hushed and introspective. It could be frantic and explosive. Stylistic breadth is one great thing about Jade Bird's music. The UK singer with the EP entitled 'Something American' has a strong grip on a variety of approaches, and the pay-off is substantial. The poise of ""What Am I Here For,"" the attack of ""Cathedral"" - each gives you a great view into the songbook of a young woman who spent her childhood in South Wales and her teenage years in London, playing coffeehouses, blues clubs and any other spot that would lend her a stage. Even though she was armed with an Oasis chord book, the first proper song she learned was Mazzy Star's ""Into Dust."" And even though her mom and dad blasted Chemical Bros, The Prodigy and Aphex Twin, she wound up loving Son House. Maybe you've heard ""Lottery"" and ""Furious."" If so, they've probably made a dent. Bird's music is instantly memorable. We know that this DSCVR version of her ""Uh Huh"" is going to impress. The 20-year-old and her band come on with the ferociousness of the Breeders during their performance. Stand back, absorb it all, and head out find more Jade Bird.

Japan's new emperor enthroned in ancient ritual - BBC News,"Japan's Emperor Naruhito has formally proclaimed his ascension to the throne in an elaborate ceremony.

The emperor, 59, officially began his reign in May after the abdication of his father, the then-Emperor Akihito.

But, after a series of traditional rituals inside the imperial palace in Tokyo, his ascension has now been formalised.

The ceremony comes as Japan reels from the effects of Typhoon Hagibis, which left almost 80 people dead.

A celebration parade was postponed out of respect for the victims and their families.

You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me

You know me a straight player
Ain't hung up on all the things you're sayin'
Tell me what you feel for me
Tired of wearing my heart on my sleeve

Wish I could read your mind
Swear you make me feel sometime like
We're too missaligned
Ain't no way I could see from your side
You took all my adoration
Pass this face, its graduation
You move forward girl why can't we pick up the speed?

Why you being cruel baby?
Don't know what you do to me
I'm runnin' out of fuel, baby
You don't know what you do to me

You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me, babe
You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me, babe
You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me, babe

Excuse me if I get impatient
Maybe i'm just sick of waitin'
Always here anticipatin'
Your next move, don't
Keep me here for decoration
I can't stand the separation
Put me on ice and you know we'll be straight
And away from you

Wish I could read your mind
Swear you make me feel sometime like
We're too missaligned
Ain't no way I could see from your side
You took all my adoration
Pass this face, its graduation
We should move forward girl
Why can't we pick up the speed?

Why you being cruel baby?
Don't know what you do to me
I'm runnin' out of fuel, baby
You don't know what you do to me

You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me, babe

You don't know what you do to me

Why you being cruel, baby?
Don't know what you do to me
Im running out of fuel baby
You don't know what you do to me

I don't wanna be a fool, baby
Don't know what you do to me
Stop playing it cool, baby
You don't know what you do to me

AUGUST 08 - Minivan (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"AUGUST 08 - Minivan. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

The final track on AUGUST 08’s new ‘Seasick’ LP is a plaintive tune called “Minivan.” From the arpeggio acoustic guitar and its opening couplet, “I can see your old house from here/Doesn’t feel the same without you near,” one could be forgiven for getting Olivia Rodrigo’s ""drivers license"" vibes. The free-thinking LA native, however, quickly subverts any and all notions of Disney purity with follow-up lines recalling hazy nights drinking E&J brandy and shooting dice. ‘Seasick’ is the prolific AUGUST’s third project of 2022, a restatement of the wise, fierce, thoughtful, and limitless scope of his futuristic R&B palette. Active in the LA music scene for a couple years now, he honed his craft in a humble Koreatown home studio. His pen and production skills earned commissions crafting tracks for DJ Khaled, Chance the Rapper, and Kali Uchis. As AUGUST 08, he’s featured with a variety of heroes - Jhene Aiko, Schoolboy Q, and 88Rising crew among them. “I’ve always been the person who goes against what everybody else feels,” he explains about his work. Even his DSCVR performance moves in different directions. “Minivan” is a moving ballad. Meanwhile the trotting rhythm of “Role Models"" will def getcha moving. Keep an eye out for this dude, he can pop up anywhere you turn.

Coronavirus: What is social distancing? - BBC News,"Governments around the world are advising people to socially distance themselves in order to reduce pressures on health services and stop the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19).

This is even more important now UK schools have been closed to most children.

But what exactly is the advice on social distancing - and who should be doing it the most? And how exactly does it stop the spread of coronavirus?

What If You Had No Fingerprints,"What role do fingerprints play in our lives? Yes, detective movies give a clear answer to this question. Also, scientists have only recently found out that fingerprints serve a person as the main mechanism of touch. Without them, it'd be difficult for you to read information and interact with whatever you're touching or holding in your hands.

Patterns on the fingers play a very important role in the fine motor skills of the hands. Thanks to them, we can easily separate thin pages of paper from each other, type on a keyboard, get cards and money from our wallets, play the piano, guitar, etc. But besides that, could fingerprints determine your character?

SUMMARY:
- A very sensitive temperature sensor is located on our palms. Remember that when you're sitting at a campfire in nature, you're constantly stretching out your hands in its direction. Also in cold weather, you feel your hands freeze faster than the rest of your body.
- Every print of every person is unique. The probability that you'll meet someone with the same finger pattern as yours is 1 in 64 million. Even for twins with the same DNA, the prints vary. 
- In Ancient Babylon, about 2000 BCE, people left prints on clay tablets as a signature. Then, in the 5-7 centuries, they were used in China for the same purpose. 
- Scientists have recorded rare cases when a person was born with absolutely smooth fingers, void of prints. Such cases in medicine are considered a manifestation of a rare genetic tendency. 
- In addition to fingerprints, people also have unique prints on their tongue and feet. And with cats and dogs, nose prints are unique.
- The patterns on our fingers can also be an additional tool for reading information. An excellent testimony of this is massage therapists. 
- Each fingerprint is unique, but nevertheless, there are only three main types of patterns for them: an arch, loops, and a whorl.
- The first type is the arch. People with these prints are very responsible, calm and balanced. They don't get mad easily. 
- The next type is the loop. People with this pattern on their fingers put self-expression and self-development in first place, even if it doesn't bring material benefits.
- And the last type is the whorl. The predominance of whorls speaks of well-developed logical and analytical thinking. People with this pattern are better at learning new languages and math.

The Strait of Hormuz: Why is it the focus of the Iran-US tensions - BBC News,"After the US pulled out of the international nuclear agreement with Iran, Tehran says it will not negotiate another deal with Washington. 

And, there’s been a deterioration in relations between the US and Iran since April, when the US ended sanctions exemptions, effectively banning all Iranian oil exports. 

Iran has threatened that if its oil exports are stopped, then no oil can pass the Strait of Hormuz. But, why is this strait so important and how could this story affect you? Parizad Nobakht from BBC World Service explains.

US president and Melania Trump tested after his close aide was confirmed to have Covid-19 - BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus and are now self-isolating.

Mr Trump, aged 74 and therefore in a high-risk group, wrote on Twitter: ""We will get through this together.

Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump said he and his wife, who is 50, were going into quarantine after Ms Hicks's positive test.

He tweeted: ""Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible!

""The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!""

It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida.

Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation.

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

15 Tricks Restaurants Use to Make You Spend More,"Remember that time you ate out and went well beyond your planned budget? Does that happen way too often? It’s no surprise since restaurants use smart tricks to make you spend more money. You can, of course, check your bills for dishes you didn’t order, but this trick isn’t really used anymore. Bright Side found out about some tricky ploys the catering world uses in order to save money on dishes and make patrons spend more.

Take, for example, complimentary snacks. Olives, crackers, and chips are not a kind gesture of the owner as you might think. The real reason for such complimentary snacks is to make you feel thirsty. After eating several of those salty snacks, you’ll want to order more drinks, bringing a bigger profit to the owner of the café.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- Bartenders often save on fruits, not because they lack these products but from simple laziness.
- Almost all restaurants are interested in having as many cozy and secluded spots for their patrons as possible. You are likely to spend more time at a comfortable table — which means that you’ll order more.
- Clients choose dishes located in the middle of the menu page more often. That’s why the owners of catering businesses indicate expensive, more profitable dishes in this space.
- David Kincheloe, president of the Association of National Restaurant Consultants, says that patrons most often get the minimum amount of expensive ingredients in their dishes, but their presence is still indicated on the menu.
- Playing with dish names also works well on diners. Marketers spend a good deal of time inventing names and descriptions for the dishes on a menu.
- Those who work in the catering sphere say that the idea of reducing portions came from retail. For example, you often see packages of 1.75 lb instead of 2 lb.
- According to restaurant menu specialist Gregg Rapp, using photos and illustrations of dishes increases sales by 3 times when it’s the only image on a page.
- Most restaurants order fresh fish on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That’s why fish very often becomes the dish of the day on Mondays — because they need to sell it before it expires.
- When you look at the wine card, you’ll most likely skip the most expensive wine. However, you won’t go for the cheapest either so as not to look cheap.
- Expensive restaurants choose classical music, which encourages visitors to spend more because it makes them feel richer.
- Lighting can influence the speed at which people eat. Expensive restaurants usually prefer soft lighting in their halls so that their visitors can relax.
- Thanks to friendly employees, visitors spend more time in restaurants and leave good tips.
