Every time I relapsed(by watching porn or fapping ) , I told myself: *“This is the last time.”* Every time I failed, I promised I’d ""try harder next time."" And every time… I ended up back at square one.

I thought I was just weak. Maybe some people had the self-control, but I didn’t.

But here’s what I finally realised after years of this cycle:

 You don’t quit by trying harder. You quit by making it impossible to fail.

# What Actually Works (From Someone Who’s Been There)

These 3 things changed everything for me:

1️ **Change the System, Not Just the Habit.**

* If your phone is always in your hand at night, guess what? You’ll relapse.
* If you’re bored, stressed, or alone all the time, guess what? You’ll relapse.
* I stopped fighting my urges and started removing the triggers.
   * No phone in bed.
   * Scheduled my evenings so I wasn’t alone with my thoughts.
   * Got an accountability partner so I couldn’t hide in guilt.

2️ **You Can’t Just ""Quit"" – You Need to Replace It.**

* Most people try to stop but don’t replace it with anything. That’s like trying to quit junk food while keeping an empty fridge.
* I had to fill the void:
   * Whenever I got an urge, I immediately switched to something else (push-ups, cold shower, reading).
   * I started working on goals that actually mattered to me. Once I got serious about my life, I didn’t even want to waste time. For me personally i was working on my business as i wanted to quit my 9-5 because I hated my boss so much.

3️ **Stop Restarting the Clock – Fix the Identity.**

* Every time I relapsed, I’d say: *""Welp, time to start over...""*
* The problem? I still saw myself as someone trying to quit instead of someone who just *doesn’t do this anymore*.
* The real shift happened when I stopped counting streaks and started thinking: *“This isn’t me anymore.”*
   * I didn’t focus on how many days I went without it.
   * I focused on who I was becoming instead.

# TL;DR: Stop Trying Harder. Change Your Environment, Replace the Habit, and Shift Your Identity.

If you’re struggling right now, Just ask yourself:

* What’s triggering this? How can I remove it?
* What can I replace this habit with?
* What kind of person do I actually want to be?

Once you fix these, willpower won’t even be needed
