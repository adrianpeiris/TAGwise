From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award¬Æ-winning director Pete Docter (‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.,‚Äù ‚ÄúUp‚Äù) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs original movie ‚Äú Inside Out,‚Äù he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all‚Äîinside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions ‚Äì Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley‚Äôs mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdlNTQGvBI

Wheelz does double back flip in a wheelchair - BBC News,"Aaron ""Wheelz"" Fotheringham is 22 and from Las Vegas, Nevada. Aaron, who was born with spina bifida, was adopted into a family of six children and used a wheelchair from an early age. 
Wheelz went to his first skate park aged 8 with his older brother and after watching from behind the fence, his brother challenged him to drop into the bowl himself. He gave it a go, landed on his face but was hooked from that moment. Now Wheelz is the only person to land a double back flip in a wheelchair and is continually pushing himself to see what tricks he can do next.
""Fear is definitely a huge part of it"" says Wheelz. "" It's more than just regular fear, it's 'I'm going to die'.""

Why Keir Starmer cut 9000 NHS England jobs,"Keir Starmer is taking president Trump style action by reducing bureaucracy and regulation, starting with the abolition of NHS England, which will be integrated into the Department of Health. He said current two-tier bureaucracy is inefficient and that resources should be redirected to frontline services like nurses, doctors, and GP appointments. Critics question whether the government was prepared for the complexities of governance, while supporters see it as a necessary step to cut duplication and streamline operations. NHS England employs over 15,000 people, and the restructuring is expected to reduce overall headcount by 50%, saving ¬£500 million annually, which the government pledges to reinvest in frontline services.

However, the announcement has caused concern among NHS staff. Unions also have criticized the plan as chaotic, stressing the need for a clear strategy to address the 7 million waiting list and 100,000 staffing vacancies. While the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats broadly support the change, there are fears that the reorganization could distract from improving patient care. Patients and the public are left wondering if this will translate into tangible benefits, such as easier access to GP appointments or NHS dentists. The success of this bold move will ultimately depend on its implementation and impact on frontline services. What are your thoughts?

"Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Alien Visits, UFOs, and Other Conspiracies","Are alien spacecrafts here on earth? In this explainer video, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice discuss the existence of aliens on earth and what the scientific community thinks of it. 

Do conspiracy theories like UFOs hold any truth or validity? Or is this obsession with aliens just fueled by the movies? Find out what T-Rex, blackholes, and the brothers Grimm have in common. We also debate whether imaginings of evil aliens are just based on how we humans treat each other. Are the people being visited by aliens always the ones in danger?

What do aliens look like? Learn why we often portray aliens as being vertebrate. Would advanced aliens capable of space travel even care about us? You‚Äôll learn how alien sightings have changed over the years with the innovations in photographic technology. We explore the leaps many people take when they discover things in the night sky. Are human senses even trustworthy without further evidence? Is the government competent enough to keep this a secret? All that and more on another StarTalk explainer!

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
In the new action comedy from DreamWorks Animation, based on the New York Times best-selling book series, a crackerjack criminal crew of animal outlaws are about to attempt their most challenging con yet--becoming model citizens. Never have there been five friends as infamous as The Bad Guys--dashing pickpocket Mr. Wolf (Academy Award¬Æ winner Sam Rockwell, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), seen-it-all safecracker Mr. Snake (Marc Maron, GLOW), chill master-of-disguise Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson, Hot Tub Time Machine franchise), short-fused ""muscle"" Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos, In the Heights) and sharp-tongued expert hacker Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina, Crazy Rich Asians), aka ""Webs."" But when, after years of countless heists and being the world's most-wanted villains, the gang is finally caught, Mr. Wolf brokers a deal (that he has no intention of keeping) to save them all from prison: The Bad Guys will go good. Under the tutelage of their mentor Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade, Paddington 2), an arrogant (but adorable!) guinea pig, The Bad Guys set out to fool the world that they've been transformed. Along the way, though, Mr. Wolf begins to suspect that doing good for real may give him what he‚Äôs always secretly longed for: acceptance. So when a new villain threatens the city, can Mr. Wolf persuade the rest of the gang to become... The Good Guys?

EU North Sea wind expansion to help move away from Russian energy - BBC News,"Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium have announced plans to increase wind power in the North Sea as the EU looks to move away from its reliance on Russian energy.

The project would see output from the North Sea increase tenfold by 2050, creating a 'green powerhouse'.

Trigonometry on Khan Academy: Big, fancy word, right? Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (""trig"" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question. Maybe you'll learn the answer from us in these tutorials!

Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. She's math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she's prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar¬Æ nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. But when she breaks her mom's #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award¬Æ winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There's one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school's beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt's Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most.

Indian PM Narendra Modi visits Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky | BBC News,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Ukraine to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 
The trip comes just weeks after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
 
The visit is significant because Kyiv and some Western capitals had reacted sharply to Mr Modi‚Äôs visit to the Russian capital in July.
 
Mr Zelensky was particularly critical, saying he was ‚Äúdisappointed to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow‚Äù.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Venezuela: Protestors clash with police after disputed election result | BBC News,"There have been protests across Venezuela following the announcement on Monday of the disputed result of the presidential election.

The National Electoral Council (CNE) - which is dominated by government allies - declared Nicol√°s Maduro the winner.

The CNE's announcement has been widely decried as fraudulent both inside and outside Venezuela with the Carter Center demanding the CNE publish the detailed voting tallies.

The opposition said the tallies it has had access to - which it has made public - show that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz√°lez, is the clear winner.

TOBi - Made Me Everything (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"TOBi - Made Me Everything. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Born in Nigeria and raised in the Toronto suburbs, Oluwatobi Feyisara Ajibolade grew up on everything from Marvin Gaye to Fela Kuti to A Tribe Called Quest. It‚Äôs easy to hear those influences in his own music. In the last two years TOBi has released two projects: 'Still' and 'ELEMENTS,' the first incorporating more boom-bap hip-hop beats then its successor. ‚ÄúCity Blues,‚Äù from ‚ÄòStill,‚Äô is a rainy portrait of street lethargy carrying enough rap bonafides for The Game himself to hop on a remix for the album‚Äôs deluxe edition. TOBi's sound has subtly shifted between the two projects. 'ELEMENTS' goes deeper into the experimental R&B, electro-pop and soul that 'Still' danced around. ‚ÄúI want people to know that I love all these kinds of music,‚Äù he‚Äôs said. ‚ÄúI look at it like the beat is a canvas and I‚Äôm the painter. I‚Äôm going to express myself however I want.‚Äù Presenting a picture - whether literally, figuratively or with the mood his music creates - is what separates TOBi from the pack. Dial up the ‚ÄúMade Me Everything‚Äù video. Uplifting, frenetic, packed with choreography and tennis, it instantly turns viewers into fans. It also has the power to get listeners through a tough day. The singer brought that good vibe to the DSCVR studio, too. ‚ÄúMade Me Everything‚Äù retains its infectious buzz, and ‚ÄúFamily Matters‚Äù resounds with the rap swag he‚Äôs always able to tap. No surprise, he truly commanded the room all on his own.

Spain puzzles over ex-King Juan Carlos's whereabouts - BBC News,"There is intense speculation in the Spanish media about the whereabouts of embattled ex-King Juan Carlos, after his shock announcement on Monday that he was leaving the country.

The 82-year-old, who is targeted by a corruption probe, announced the move in a letter posted on the royal website.

It gave no details about his destination, but some reports suggest he has gone to the Dominican Republic.

Juan Carlos said he would be available if prosecutors needed to speak to him.

In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened an investigation into his alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia.

Guitarricadelafuente - Qui√©n Encendi√≥ La Luz (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Guitarricadelafuente - Qui√©n Encendi√≥ La Luz (Live). Una sesi√≥n exclusiva para Vevo DSCVR, el canal donde encontrar√°s la mejor m√∫sica emergente.

√Ålvaro Lafuente Calvo was celebrating his fifteenth birthday when his Valencian father gave him his first guitar. It didn‚Äôt take long for the nascent hobby to turn into a life-changing passion. Rumba and flamenco, the traditional genres of his Spanish home region, ran in his blood. But also, contemporary indie and pop sounds caught his fancy. Like ROSAL√çA and C. Tangana, Guitarricadelafuente - his highly literal moniker - was soon connecting classic traditions to modern moods, building a fetching musical world. A countrywide tour playing small bars and clubs was a chance to build his live performance muscles. Now Guitarricadelafuente has emerged from lockdown as a fully formed artist: his music videos are stirring and scenic slices of everyday life, and his ephemeral soundscapes continue to pull and stretch boundaries. There‚Äôs no better place for a rising artist to take chances than our DSCVR platform, and these experimental performances of ‚ÄúQui√©n Encendi√≥ La Luz‚Äù and ‚ÄúMil Y Una Noches‚Äù prove that he‚Äôs one of the most interesting and unique voices out there.

12 Signs of High Intelligence You Probably Have,"Some of your characteristics may signify a higher than average intellect. Are you a night owl? Or a procrastinator? Then you are way smarter than you think!

We all have little things about ourselves that may seem useless or even annoying to other people at times. But hold off before you start beating yourself up or trying to change these little behaviors. You're probably a genius!  

TIMESTAMPS
You‚Äôre a lefty. 0:52
You often freak out over the littlest things. 1:58
You have a good sense of humor. 2:47
You're a little on the nosy side. 3:41
You're a night owl. 4:34
You're extremely sensitive or easily distracted. 6:03
You walk a lot. 6:50
You realize how much knowledge you still lack. 7:28
You're a master of self-control. 8:09
You often procrastinate. 9:06
You're constantly munching on something. 10:00
You fall asleep from time to time during the day. 10:42

SUMMARY
- Scientists found a link between left-handedness and a notion called ‚Äúdivergent thinking‚Äù, which is a kind of creativity that allows someone to generate new ideas. 
- People who tend to worry a lot take the quality of their work more seriously. 
- Humor influences intellect by exercising the brain and keeping it in tip-top shape. Next time your friends tell you to quit clowning around, just tell them you are exercising your intellect! 
- Curiosity and an inquisitive mind make people more intelligent. Scientists had been observing 6,000 people born in the last 50 years, and they found that preteen children who had got the most points on IQ tests grew up to be more curious and open-minded adults. 
- Scientists say that this preference for late hours could be due to the fact that brain activity (therefore, intellect) is so high that it challenges your body‚Äôs circadian rhythm.
- The harder it is for a person to stay focused, the cleverer they are. How so? Again, it‚Äôs that intense brain activity. It‚Äôs just too hard to control. 
- People who live in cities built with a focus on walking have a higher intelligence indicator than those living in cities with lots of cars and other types of transport. 
- The less bright a person is, the more they overestimate their cognitive abilities. The same goes the other way around. Intelligent people aren't afraid to say, ‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù, and if they don't know, they can find this thing out later. 
- Intelligent people are able to overcome their impulses and suppress their emotions. They also typically think about the consequences before they do something. 
- Scientists agree that intelligent people tend to postpone their tasks for later. Psychologist Adam Grant says that procrastination is the key to innovation. Steve Jobs managed to use his procrastination strategically, letting his brain rest and switching to completely different tasks before finishing the ones he had started.

The Ultimate MEXICAN STREET FOOD TACOS Tour of Mexico City! (ft. La Ruta de la Garnacha),"‚ñ∫Subscribe to Lalo‚Äôs channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo
‚ñ∫T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo), he‚Äôs from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we‚Äôd ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharr√≥n taco with chicharr√≥n salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo‚Äôs favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los G√ºeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that‚Äôs juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

A Young Man Tried to Save Lakes But No One Expected This Result,"1.8 billion ‚Äì that‚Äôs how many people on our planet are currently living without access to clean drinking water. One of the biggest culprits in this problem is water pollution. Luckily, there are people like Ramveer Tanwar setting an example and taking action to solve this crisis! 

Ramveer Tanwar is running a campaign #SelfieWithPond on Facebook to draw the attention of young people to the problem of dying lakes.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- When Tanwar was a student at a local technical university, he noticed that his favorite childhood hangouts were starting to disappear. While clean water levels are declining throughout India, the crisis is especially bad in the remote regions like where Tanwar is from.
- Tanwar started off by giving lessons to kids from his village, who began to feel like they had to do something about their dying water sources. 
- Later, he told the students to come with their parents every Sunday to a special place where he‚Äôd facilitate a discussion and suggest methods to conserve water. 
- In 2015, Ramveer and his team of volunteers, students, and their parents removed all the garbage from the first pond. Not only did they clean it, they also planted some trees around it. 
- Thanks to the efforts of many volunteers and enthusiasts, dozens of lakes and ponds have been restored throughout India. The most important thing in cleaning these bodies of water was to prevent further pollution.
- The state authorities then helped Ramveer set up something called ‚ÄúGroundwater Army‚Äù organizations in each district of the state, and the young pioneer is now the coordinator in his district.
- Another campaign the young Indian environmentalist started is called #SelfieWithPond. The idea of it, according to Tanwar himself, is ‚Äúto connect the youth with dying lakes, which are being converted into dumping sites.‚Äù
- Felix Finkbeiner, a 21-year-old from Germany, is the founder of a global youth movement called Plant for the Planet. Its 75,000 climate ambassadors have planted a total of over 15 billion saplings worldwide! 
- Another example of a young person gaining international fame for their passionate pursuit of improving our planet‚Äôs ecology is Greta Thunberg.
-  In the summer of 2018, when a crazy heatwave struck northern Europe and caused forest fires, she took a handmade banner and sat on the stairs of the Swedish Parliament building all by herself.

Lyrics:

Verse 1
I‚Äôve tried so hard to see it
Took me so long to believe it
That You‚Äôd choose someone like me
To carry Your victory

Verse 2
Perfection could never earn it
You give what we don‚Äôt deserve and
You take the broken things
And raise them to glory

Chorus 1
You are my champion
Giants fall when you stand
Undefeated
Every battle You‚Äôve won
I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated, in the heavenly place
Undefeated, with the
One who has conquered it all
 
Verse 3
Now I can finally see it
You‚Äôre teaching me how to receive
So let all the striving cease
This is my victory

Bridge
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me

Chorus 2
You are my champion
Giants fall when you stand
Undefeated
Every battle You‚Äôve won
I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated, in the heavenly place
Undefeated, by the power of Your name
I am seating, in the heavenly place
Undefeated, with the One you has conquered it all

Stirling Moss: Racing Legend and Mille Miglia Champion - Pebble Beach Week,"The Pebble Beach Concours  d'Elegance brings together not just the cars that made history, but the people who made it with them. Let's meet one of the legends who will be at the 65th Concours  d'Elegance this weekend.

In the late 1920's, Brescia, Italy was about to lose the Italian Grand Prix to Milan. With a group of wealthy associates, they decided to create a race better and more epic than any Grand Prix. They decided to have a thousand mile race from Brescia to Rome and back, and call it The Mille Miglia. 

The Mille Miglia was an open-road endurance race which took place in Italy from 1927 to 1957. This event was usually dominated by Italian drivers, but three races were won by foreign racers. One of those racers was Stirling Moss. 

Stirling Moss was Britain's top racing driver of the 1950's and early 1960's. He won 212 of the 529 races he competed in, including 16 Grand Prix. Moss set the Mille Miglia record finishing in 10 hours, 7 minutes and 48 seconds, in his Mercedes Benz 300 SLR. Listen to how Stirling Moss set this record on such a treacherous and epic race!

Tune in to Motor Trend OnDemand and the Motor Trend Youtube Channel Sunday August 16th @ 4pm EST for LIVE coverage of the 65th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.

What If You Didn't Exercise at All?,"Each of us wants to look great and be healthy. But when it comes to exercise, many people find reasons not to go to the gym. But what‚Äôs happening inside your body if you don't exercise at all? You might see more acne, dullness, and wrinkles on your face. You feel tired, weak, and lazy all day. You might even get digestive issues. And this is hardly a complete list.

Nobody's going to preach at you to go out there and hit the gym, join a track team, or stop watching TV and playing video games altogether because those are the culprits of a sedentary lifestyle. No need for drastic measures here. Start slow, and your body won‚Äôt be shocked into this new healthy lifestyle!

SUMMARY:
- Exercise gets blood flowing. With good circulation coming their way, skin cells get the nourishment they need. 
- Any physical movement that‚Äôs more than your norm will have you feeling winded. A short flight of stairs, running for the bus, even cleaning your house will have you taking breaks to catch your breath! 
- Don‚Äôt expect to feel alive and vibrant if you spend most of the day sitting. 
- If you‚Äôre not using a lot of energy throughout the day, your body will have a hard time going into Sleep Mode. 
- Your body will crave sugar for a quick fuel source to boost your energy. 
- Without regular physical exercise, you might find yourself having a hard time concentrating on tasks, staying focused, and processing information.
- Blood pressure can fluctuate when you don‚Äôt have a regular exercise routine. If your blood pressure is too high, you can have frequent headaches, irregular heartbeat, and even vision problems!
- Better sleep, a healthy diet, and all the things that usually come with an active lifestyle all help to strengthen immunity.
- If you‚Äôre not moving your muscles, then they won‚Äôt build strength ‚Äì period.
- Building strength in your muscles often means improving your balance and sharpening your mental clarity.
- You don‚Äôt just build strength when you work those muscles of yours. You improve flexibility as well. 
- What does poor posture mean? Back and neck pain, yes, obviously. But it also causes poor circulation and organ function because of the pressure you‚Äôre putting on your innards! 
- Exercise strengthens your bones too. Weight-lifting and high-impact activities like running or jogging put pressure on your bones. Your body reacts by strengthening them.
- Physical activity, among aaall the other things on this list, also boosts the production of these mood-boosters!
- It‚Äôs your own self-esteem and confidence that can take a nose-dive because of all these physical consequences of not exercising. 
- Think of it this way: your energy levels are low, which also means your metabolism slows down.

What Happens to Your Body at the Mariana Trench Bottom?,"The Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean is the deepest place on our planet. If you throw a rock into the water, it'll travel 36,000 feet before touching the bottom. But unlike your body, the rock won't experience any unpleasant consequences. After all, it doesn't get affected by all that immense pressure that builds up the deeper you go!

But here's a thought experiment: what would happen to your body at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench? Put on your flippers, you're going for a dive. Oh, and fair warning, you won't be alone. Get ready to meet some of the most interesting creatures you can only find in the depths of the Mariana Trench! ??

27 DIY FURNITURE MAKEOVER || UPGRADE YOUR HOME,"HOW TO RECYCLE AND REPURPOSE YOUR OLD FURNITURE USING THESE HACKS

Sometimes we have sturdy furniture in our house, but we don‚Äôt want to use it because it looks out of fashion. Well, in this video, I show you some cool recycling hacks that will bring your old furniture back to life. 
Take an old coffee table and paint it a bold color (like red, green, or blue), then, take a sticker stencil, place it on the table, and then using a sponge give it a fun look using gold paint. 
Take the cupboard doors off an old display furniture, paint them white and then use them as picture frames for your wall. 
If the sides of your coffee table have worn out, cut it from the middle, and then fill it up with some fairy lights. After that, add some translucent glass on top and voila. 
Another great idea is to take a ladder and use it as a shelving unit for your plant pots and books in your living room.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

34 Outstanding Recycling DIYs,"Brilliant repurposing and recycling hacks everyone can make

We live in a world where most of the things we own are disposable. Every day, we throw away tons of rubbish; most of which is plastic. ‚Äì That takes 1,000 years to decompose. One way to do your part and help the environment is to eliminate the rubbish you throw away, and I‚Äôve got some repurposing ideas for you. If you have a 3D pen, then you‚Äôre going to love my money-saving DIY crafts too. I show you how to make beautiful keyrings, how to organize your wires, and how to make a beautiful and reusable coffee cup sleeve.
But of course, hot-glue is a must in these hacks and a great tool. I show you how to create beautiful sequin earrings with hot glue, and other little decorations around your house.
Watch the entire video to discover how many things you can make with plastic bottles.

LETRA:

Ya no s√© qu√© hacer
No s√© con cu√°l quedarme
Todas saben en la cama maltratarme
Me tienen bien. De sexo, me tienen bien

Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

La primera se desespera
Se encojona si se lo echo afuera
La segunda tiene la funda
Y me paga pa' que se lo hunda
La tercera me quita el estr√©s
Polvo corridos siempre echamos tres
A la cuarta de una, le bajo la luna
Pero ella quiere con Maluma y conmigo a la vez
Estoy enamorado de las cuatro
Siempre las busco despu√©s de las cuatro
A las cuatro les encanta en cuatro
Y yo nunca fallo como el 24
De los Lakers siempre es la gorra
De chingar ninguna se enzorra
Estoy metio' en un l√≠o, y hasta confundio'
Porque ninguna de mi mente se borra

Me pongo las gafas Cartier, saliendo del aeropuerto
Vestio' Giuseppe , zapatos en piel
T√∫ tienes todas mis cuentas de banco y el n√∫mero de la MasterCard
T√∫ eres mi mujer oficial, me tiene enamorado ese culote con ese pelo rubio
Pero tengo otra pelinegra que siempre quiere chichar
A veces hasta le llega al estudio
La pelirroja chichando es la m√°s que se moja
La encojona que me llame y no lo coja
Peleamos y me bota la ropa y tengo que llamar a cotorra pa' que la recoja
Tengo una chiquitita nalgona con el pelo corto
Me dice papi vente adentro, si me pre√±a
Bryant Myers

Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

Y estoy met√≠o en un l√≠o
A todas yo quiero darle
Me tienen bien confund√≠o
Ya no s√© ni con cu√°l quedarme
Y es que todas maman bien
Todas me los hacen bien
Todas quieren chingarme encima de billetes de cien
Me tienen en un pat√≠n
Comprando en San Valent√≠n
Ya me salieron m√°s caras que un reloj de Ulysse Nardin
Es que las babys est√°n dura y ninguna de la' cuatro se ha hecho completa
Dos tienen maridos y ninguna de las dos al marido respetan

Cuatro chimbitas, cuatro personalidades
Dos me hablan bonito, dos dicen maldades
Diferentes nacionalidades
Pero cuando chingan gritan todas por iguales
Quiere que la lleve pal Medallo
Quiere que la monte en carro del a√±o
Que a una la coja, a la otra la apriete
Y a las otras dos les d√© juntas en el ba√±o
Digan qu√© m√°s quieren hacer
El Dirty las va a entretener
En la casa gigante, hay un party en el yate que √©l quiere tener
No s√© si me entiendes, beb√©

Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice explore the massive heat waves that have been sweeping the world with Director of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Gavin Schmidt. 

Learn what qualifies something as a heat wave. We break down the extreme heat happening globally and the pressure it's been putting on current infrastructure. Why exactly are we seeing more of the extreme heat? We get into the jet stream and wave patterns in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Why do we pay attention to extreme heat in some regions but not others? Will someplace become unlivable? Finally, learn about the last ice age and what sorts of changes our climate is facing. What‚Äôs our heat limit?

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ5l3ZUGQPQ

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

*PLEASE read the details below if you are planning your own road trip here* :) 

Aboriginal held land in Australia is private property and to travel through, you need permission often in the form of a permit. For Kiwirrkurra Country, a permit allows you to travel along the main road, into community and camp at approved campsites. Access into any other areas aside from this is still prohibited. More information on traveling through Kiwirrkurra country can be found at https://www.tjamutjamu.com/travelling-to-kiwirrkurra-country and https://kiwirrkurra.au/. The Kiwirrkurra Traditional Owners thank you for respecting their culture and country.

ALSO! If you are looking to buy Aboriginal art, make sure you buy from the most ethical sources which are community artist-owned art galleries and collectives. For Kiwirrkurra art you can purchase through Papunya Tula Artists (https://papunyatula.com.au/). For other Central Australian Aboriginal art, visit Desart for more information at https://desart.com.au/ Thank you :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ9cpQ1PWBU
Why everyone in Japan is talking about this dad - BBC News,"Japan's environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi is raising eyebrows by taking time off to take care of his newborn son.

It's not only because he is the first minister and MP to do so, but also because very few dads in Japan actually take paternity leave. The BBC's Mariko Oi explains why.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

"Torture stories emerge from Russian-occupied region of Ukraine, Kherson ‚Äì BBC News","There have been multiple accounts of torture and kidnap in the Ukrainian region of Kherson which has been occupied by Russian troops since the invasion began, the BBC has heard.

The UN and Human Rights Watch have said they're investigating accusations of human rights abuses and have gathered similar testimonies.
As more testimonies are gathered from the region, many paint a picture of fear, intimidation, violence, and repression.

The Russian Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment.

Guatemala blocks thousands of people bound for US - BBC News,"A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala as they attempt to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border.

Thousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept ""illegal mass movements"".

Every year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try to reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as ""caravans"".

President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican.

Soleimani: Trump threatens Iraq with sanctions if US troops are expelled  - BBC News,"President Trump has threatened severe sanctions against Iraq after its parliament called on US troops to leave the country.

""We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters.

Tensions are high after the US assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week.

Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"".

Soleimani, 62, spearheaded Iranian military operations in the Middle East, and was regarded as a terrorist by the US.

The general's remains have now returned to his home country, where mourners packed the streets of Tehran early on Monday.

Huge crowds packed the streets of the Iranian capital Tehran for the funeral of the slain Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei led prayers and at one point was seen weeping.

Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"" for the death of Soleimani and on Sunday pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord.

Soleimani, 62, headed Iran's elite Quds Force, and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East.

Lyrics:

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
(chorus)
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you make everything stop.
Finally you put my love on top.",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7vObnFUJc

Algebra II on Khan Academy: Your studies in algebra 1 have built a solid foundation from which you can explore linear equations, inequalities, and functions. In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe. We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices. Don't let these big words intimidate you. We're on this journey with you!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Lyrics:
Go tell it on the mountain
The one that we‚Äôve been waiting for
The king of our salvation
Born on this day our savior Christ the Lord
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
That we can be forgiven
The weight of all our sin He came to bear
 
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
 
Go tell it on the mountain
Humbly in a manger lay
Mercy sent from heaven
Angels fill the sky with highest praise
 
Go tell it on the mountain
this baby born of virgin birth
The ruler of all nations

Apple commits to $500bn US investment | BBC News,"Apple plans to invest more than $500bn (¬£396bn) in the US over the next four years, starting with a new advanced manufacturing factory in Texas.
 
The tech giant said it expected to create 20,000 new jobs over that time, with the ""vast majority"" of roles in research and development, software and artificial intelligence.
 
It is not clear to what extent the spending is an acceleration of the company's current activities. Apple said the sum included everything from spending on suppliers to Apple TV+ productions.
 
The announcement comes days after Apple boss Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump, who has made increased corporate investment in the US a priority.

Tiny Scottish town opens arms to Ukrainian refugees - BBC News,"It's nearly eight weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, forcing about four million people to flee their homes.

So far only 12,000 of them have reached the UK - and that's partly down to delays in granting visas.

Residents in the town of Aberfeldy in Perthshire, Scotland, say they are making it their mission to welcome as many Ukrainians as possible.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has apologised for the ""frustrating"" visa delays which have prevented thousands of Ukrainian refugees entering the UK.

Ensuring Access to Safe Water in South Sudan,"‚ÄúWe never used to know whether the water was clean or not, but we later found out that it was contaminated. The water gave us diarrhea,‚Äù said Roda James, a resident of Labarab, a remote area in eastern South Sudan. She and her community are not alone‚Äîacross South Sudan, access to safe water remains a challenge.

Early this year, Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) launched a campaign to drill ten boreholes to provide safe water for drinking and cooking in the Maruwa, Labarab, and Boma areas in the east of the country. Drilling boreholes is an important health strategy to prevent waterborne diseases. Roda used to spend nearly an hour every day searching for water from the river before a hand pump was recently installed in her village. ‚ÄúWe had a lot of sickness and having clean water has helped us a lot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe now have access to clean water for cooking and drinking. Our life has changed.‚Äù

Myanmar army clashes with anti-coup militia ‚Äì BBC News,"The army in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, has clashed with a local militia opposed to February's military coup.

The clashes are the first time the People's Defense Forces (PDF)  - a collective name for militia groups that have sprung up in Myanmar since the coup - have come up against the army in a major city.

Myanmar's military junta has violently put down anti-coup protests in the country, killing hundreds of civilians.

Until now, actions by the PDF have been limited to fighting in rural areas or small towns. Tuesday's clashes brought the violence to a major city, marking a new phase in the fallout from the coup.

According to local reports, troops raided a boarding school being used as a base by the militia, leading to an exchange of gunfire.

Mars landings that did (and didn't) go to plan - BBC News,"There will be two attempts to land on Mars in 2021 - by Nasa and the China National Space Administration.

Nasa's Perseverance is scheduled to touch down on the Martian surface on 18 February.

If successful, it will be the biggest and most sophisticated vehicle ever sent to land on another planet.

China's Tianwen-1 will attempt a similar feat in May or June.

The US and the former Soviet Union are the only countries to successfully land on the Red Planet, though more have sent spacecraft to enter Mars' orbit.

Science reporter Laura Foster looks back at 60 years of successes and failures.

Human beings tend to associate size with authority and power, which is probably why we use phrases like ‚Äúthe bigger, the better‚Äù and put so much emphasis on ‚Äúmaking it big.‚Äù When it comes to these things in this video, it‚Äôs been confirmed time and time again that bigger is better.

SUMMARY
- The biggest land mass on the planet is the continent of Asia, both by size and population. Asia has an area of 17,139,445 square miles and is home to over 4 billion people. More than half of that population is concentrated in 2 countries: China and India.
- More big things in nature include the Giant Sequoia of California‚Äôs Sequoia National Park. This enormous tree, affectionately named General Sherman, has 52,500 cubic ft of trunk volume, which is equal to more than half the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
- Some of you may remember hearing about a gigantic petrified tree stump being discovered in Wyoming. Unfortunately, it turns out that this tree stump wasn‚Äôt a tree stump at all. Geologists think that it‚Äôs actually an eroded remnant of a laccolith, which is a sheet intrusion between layers of sedimentary rock.
- Robert Wadlow, the tallest person in the world, was almost as tall as that tree stump. Before he died in 1940, Wadlow was recorded at almost 9 ft tall (he peaked at 8‚Äô 11.1‚Äù). His continued growth was due to a condition called gigantism.
- The world‚Äôs largest pizza was prepared by a team of 5 Italian chefs in 2012. It had a total surface area of 13,580.28 sq ft and measured 131 ft across.
- The tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, measuring a total of 2,722 ft high and 3,331,100 sq ft
- The world‚Äôs biggest amusement park is the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, which can see up to 50 million visitors in a single year. In terms of actual size, Disney World comes in first again, with 47 square miles of land.
- The Amazon rainforest is 2,123,562 square miles in area, which covers land belonging to 9 countries.
- Soviet aviation engineers built the Antonov AN-225, also known as the Mriya, during the Cold War. The Antonov holds the record for the largest winged aircraft ever built ‚Äî separate from the Airlander 10 airship, which is the largest flying vehicle ever.
- The most monstrous monster truck is called Bigfoot 5, and it has more than earned its name. Built in 1986 by Bob Marilyn Chandler, Bigfoot weighs in at over 28,000 lb, stands at 15.5 ft tall, and uses 10-ft-tall Firestone Tundra tires.

Thai Street Food in ANCIENT SUKHOTHAI - Legendary Noodles + Spicy Fish in Thailand! üáπüá≠,"üé• Amazing Hotel Tour in Sukhothai: https://youtu.be/Tj_TvpUwD-8
üëç 100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z

SUKHOTHAI, THAILAND - Sukhothai was the ancient capital of Siam, and in Sukhothai, there‚Äôs a wealth of Thai history and culture. It was my first time visit, and I was very excited to explore some of the best Thai street food in Sukhothai, and to also visit the Sukhothai Historical Park. Let‚Äôs explore and eat through Sukhothai, Thailand! #Sukhothai #ThaiFood #streetfood

Market - We started the morning at the local market, within the old part of Sukhothai. The market was quiet and charming, not too busy, but friendly. There wasn't a lot of pre-cooked food to eat, but mainly ingredients. 

Grilled banana (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏¢) - 5 THB ($0.16) - We did find some delicious grilled bananas and rice snacks at the front of the market grilling in banana leaf packets. One of them tasted like fresh banana bread, which was great.

Ta Puy Noodle (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏õ‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏¢) - Even though there wasn‚Äôt much food to eat at the market, that was alright, because our main breakfast in Sukhothai was to eat famous Sukhothai noodles, which are well known across Thailand, especially famous in Bangkok. We went to a restaurant that is know to serve the original Sukhothai Noodles (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢). The noodles were very good, kind of sweet for me, but well balanced in flavor at the same time. I did really like their variation of Pad Thai. Price - 40 THB ($1.30) per bowl

Sukhothai Historical Park - 100 THB ($3.24) - Next on this Thai street food tour of Sukhothai, we did some sightseeing of the amazing Sukhothai Historical Park. It‚Äôs one of the best and most preserved ancient sites of Thailand. We rented bicycles and cruised around, visiting some of the most iconic historical sites:

Wat Maha That (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏∏ ‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢)
Wat Si Sawai (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¢ ‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢)
Wat Si Chum (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏° ‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢)

Fuang Fah Restaurant (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏ü‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ü‡πâ‡∏≤) - When the sun got really hot, we headed to Fuang Fah Restaurant (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏ü‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ü‡πâ‡∏≤) restaurant in Sukhothai city for a spicy meal of river fish. The owner family was so nice and hospitable, and we ordered some of their most unique special dishes. Here are a few of the special dishes we ordered:

Crunchy catfish curry (‡∏â‡∏π‡πà‡∏â‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏ü‡∏π)
Asian redtail catfish, fresh chili (‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏î)
Snakehead fish tom yum (‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ä‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô)

Food was spectacular, and I loved how she added in chili paste, fresh and dry chilies to each dish to give them huge spice and flavor. An amazing meal, must eat at a restaurant when you‚Äôre in Sukhothai and if you love spicy food!
Total price - 790 THB ($25.60)

We completed this tour of Sukhothai, Thailand by going to Wat Si Chum (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏° ‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢). Although it was already closed when we arrived, it was still possible to walk around and see from the outside. It was a great way to end an amazing day in Sukhothai, Thailand!

Thank you for watching this full Thai street food and attractions tour of Sukhothai, Thailand!

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Medium Build - In My Room (Live | Vevo DSCVR),"Medium Build - In My Room (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Some singer-songwriters reel off 14 verses and never have their point come across. For the last several years, Medium Build (aka Nick Carpenter) has made a good chunk of his lyrics turn your head immediately, usually while throwing in a little philosophy for good measure. ‚ÄúWhy do we have to be something bigger than we were yesterday?‚Äù he queries on one song from his 2019 album, ‚ÄòWild.‚Äô And in the new ‚ÄúIn My Room,‚Äù his portrait of a family in emotional disarray gets more and more vivid, and therefore increasingly poignant, with each new turn of phrase. The singer, from a kid‚Äôs POV, sits on his bed and wonders ‚Äúif I‚Äôll ever get so rich that I never feel alone when I‚Äôm at home?‚Äù A Georgia youth whose Tennessee college stint and subsequent search-for-self foray in Alaska, Carpenter‚Äôs world view centers on a search for deeper and wider perspective. Dude‚Äôs always writing. He currently has four albums and a live EP in his pocket. Last year he connected with X Ambassadors‚Äô Sam Harris and commiserated about the frustrations of being in fledgling bands as kids in the heartfelt, ‚ÄúFriend For Life.‚Äù Carpenter has said he‚Äôs gone through phases of ‚Äúripping off‚Äù Bruce Springsteen, Mumford & Sons, and Paul McCartney, but pushed on with his songs because he wanted to find his true voice. We think he‚Äôs there, and as you can hear on these performances of ‚ÄúCrying Over U‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn My Room,‚Äù his way with sculpting a lyric is just as captivating as his way of delivering its meaning.

Amazing Green Papaya Salad and Grilled Chicken in Ubon Ratchathani,"For more details, click here ‚ñ∫ http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/12/som-tam-gai-yang-ubon-ratchathani/

Ubon Ratchathani is a small city in the Isaan region of Thailand, and one of my favorite restaurants in the city is a place called Pornthip Som Tam Gai Yang ‚Äì Wat Jaeng (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á). The restaurant is well known throughout Ubon Ratchathani, often considered one of the premiere places in the city for the combination of gai yang (grilled chicken) and som tam (green papaya salad). And along with these two signature dishes, they also have numerous other wonderful Thai Isaan food to choose from.

This was my first time to visit Ubon Ratchathani, and for one of my first meals, we headed straight to Pornthip Som Tam Gai Yang ‚Äì Wat Jaeng (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á). Although there are many different types of Thai green papaya salad to order, probably my favorite is version is called Som tam Laos (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ß), green papaya salad that‚Äôs named after the country of Laos, and includes slivers of green papaya dressed with lots of pungent fermented fish sauce. This plate of som tam was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had in my life, flavored almost perfectly for my taste buds, and it included a wonderful mixture of ingredients, like a Laos olive, and a handful of sprinkle of white popinac seeds, which have a bit of an earthy green flavor - and I think they go wonderful with a green papaya salad.

Along with the amazing som tam, what Pornthip Som Tam Gai Yang ‚Äì Wat Jaeng (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á) is most well known for throughout Ubon Ratchathani is their grilled chicken. The chicken was nicely marinated, then grilled over low heat, so it was cooked to perfection, and remained juicy with an outstanding smoky flavor. But even better than the actual grilled chicken, was the sauce that it was served with - there were two different types of sauce, both equally wonderful. The first sauce, the light colored sauce, was a combination of chilies and garlic, and I think they might have used a hint of Sprite or some carbonated drink, because it had a little zing to it. The other sauce was a combination of fish sauce and chili flakes. The gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á) was marvelous.

Additionally we also ordered the tom saeb graduk moo (‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π), pork ribs made into a delicious Isaan style soup. Unlike other restaurants that serve tom saeb in a normal bowl, at this restaurant I liked how they served it in a fire pot so it stayed piping hot for our entire meal. The soup was wonderful, fiery spicy and filled with dry chilies, sour from lime juice, and teeming with fresh herbs like cilantro and mint. I wasn‚Äôt planning to order their sausage, sai krok moo yang (‡πÑ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á), but my wife wanted to try it, so we got an order. It turned out to be just as delicious as everything else, and what I also liked about it was that it seemed a bit less fatty than other versions I‚Äôve had.

If you ever get a chance to go to the small town of Ubon Ratchathani, don‚Äôt mis a meal or a few at Pornthip Som Tam Gai Yang ‚Äì Wat Jaeng (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á):

Luigi Mangione charged with murdering healthcare CEO in New York City | BBC News,"A 26-year-old man has been charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City.
 
Luigi Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald's in the town of Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 280 miles (450km) west of New York City on Monday after a customer at the fast-food outlet recognised him.
 
An Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland family, he was found in possession of a gun and a handwritten document that indicated ""motivation and mindset"", according to police.
 
Mr Mangione then appeared in a Pennsylvania court to be arraigned on five initial counts and was denied bail.

CONNY - Balkon (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Conny - Balkon (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Clubs across Germany might want to make sure their sound systems are in proper order when Conny comes to their town this fall. The rising rapper - whose real name is Constantin H√∂ft - spits hefty lyrical messages that are best blasted loud and clear. As part of the duo Der Plot, which he founded with school pal and fellow musician Elm√§x, young mister H√∂ft initially announced himself as a deft rhymer in 2018 on the ‚ÄòLieder √ºber Lara‚Äô EP. More carefree sounding than his recent output, early tracks such as the bouncy ‚ÄúBalkon‚Äù - which he performed for DSCVR - were built on modernized boom-bap drum machine sounds, playful soundscapes, and lyrics about girls and partying. With time comes maturity, though. Conny now flits his sharp tongue at more important topics: gender roles, feminism, critical masculinity - an all-to-rare palette of topics not only for German rap but also for hip-hop writ large. Focus turned to his ‚ÄòManic Pixie Dream Boy‚Äô project series, a smartly ironic twist on a film term for a misogynistic female stereotype. ‚ÄòF√ºr immer tempor√§r‚Äô is its follow-up; it translates to ‚Äúforever temporary.‚Äù Dude has a way with words, no doubt. We particularly appreciate how he deploys his skill to highlight meaningful - and many times deep and vulnerable - topics. That said, it‚Äôs hard to hide a smile when you do what you love, and Conny let slip a few wry grins while he traipsed through ‚ÄúF√ºrdichw√ºrdich‚Äù in our studio. Sounds great coming through our speakers, that‚Äôs for sure.

UMI - Pretty Girl hi! (Live) | Vevo DSCVR at Home,"UMI - Pretty Girl hi!. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

UMI will lead you towards serenity. Snappin‚Äô snare drums and heavenly synths guide the way on her new 'Introspection' EP. Most of the six songs highlight the LA-based singer/songwriter's deft guitar work. Lyrically, she weaves tales of self-love and intention with airy vocals that quickly win over listeners. A fresh face of the latest neo-soul generation, UMI speaks of being a disciple of Erykah Badu and SZA, and those influences echo through 'Introspection,' too. On social media, she encourages her followers with posi messages of self-empowerment. A recent Insta post read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having a transcendent time reconnecting with nature. I‚Äôm reminded of our infinite creative potential.‚Äù That sentiment matches the vibe here, too. With birds chirping in the background, the organic singer fit right into the verdant setting of her ‚ÄúPretty Girl hi!‚Äù DSCVR at Home performance. Bet her magic eases you into her little slice of tranquility.

What If Earth Split and Pulled You to the Center,"Okay, here's another cool 'what if' scenario for you. What if the Earth were physically split in half? Is it even possible to separate the planet? Weel, to do that, a super-powerful laser would be needed. Such a laser has to receive energy directly from the sun. The weapon goes into space on a rocket thousands of miles above our world. Then, once the laser arrives at its destination, it opens wide to expose plates of solar panels. The laser absorbs and concentrates the sun's rays. Then a powerful energy beam with the diameter of several cities shoots into the middle of the planet.

Oceans through which the beam passes boil and evaporate from the high temperature. These vapors turn into a vast thundercloud in the sky. A strong wind drives these clouds over the continents. Heavy rain falls, which floods not only cities but entire countries. As the tectonic plates shift, tsunamis are created. Huge waves crash onto the shore. The Earth is split in two. And, this is just the beginning... Do you like disaster movies? Then you'll definitely like our new 'what if' video.

How NASA Will Test Its SLS Rocket‚Äôs Core Stage,"Before NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System (SLS) rocket launches NASA‚Äôs Artemis missions to the Moon, its massive core stage must pass Green Run testing at NASA‚Äôs Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. This video explains how the core stage is brought to life to complete the test. The SLS rocket‚Äôs core stage is the world‚Äôs largest rocket stage, stretching 212 feet from end to end with two huge propellant tanks, four RS-25 engines, and miles of cabling and avionics systems. The SLS core stage Green Run test series is designed to verify the core stage is ready for the first and future Artemis missions.

NASA is targeting the SLS Green Run hot fire for March 18, 2021 and will broadcast the test live on NASA TV.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Alex (Ben Stiller), Morty (Chris Rock) and other zoo animals find a way to escape from Madagascar when the penguins reassemble a wrecked airplane. The precariously repaired craft stays airborne just long enough to make it to the African continent. There the New Yorkers encounter members of their own species for the first time. Africa proves to be a wild place, but Alex and company wonder if it is better than their Central Park home.

"Gaza ceasefire talks might be ‚Äòlast chance‚Äô to free hostages, says Blinken | BBC News","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said now is ""probably the best, maybe the last opportunity"" to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.
 
Mr Blinken made his comments during a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday during his ninth trip to the region since the war began in October.
 
The US has expressed optimism about a deal since talks resumed in Doha last week, but that level of optimism is not shared by the Israeli leadership or Hamas.
 
Each accuses the other of obstinate cynicism, and blocking a deal.

Lyrics:
Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh-oh, we can learn to love again
Oh-oh, can learn to love again
Oh, oh, that we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpQFFLBMEPI

Juan Guaid√≥ flies back to Venezuela amid arrest risk - BBC News,"Venezuela's self-declared interim leader Juan Guaid√≥ has arrived at the main airport of the country's capital, Caracas, where he risks arrest.

""We are here in Venezuela and will continue moving forward,"" he said after disembarking from the plane that flew him back from a tour of other Latin American countries.

He defied a travel ban imposed by the country's Supreme Court when he left the country last month.

He has called on Venezuelans to join anti-government protests planned for Monday and Tuesday.

Mr Guaid√≥ has called on President Nicol√°s Maduro to resign.
The two men have been at loggerheads for more than a month. While Mr Guaid√≥ has been recognised by more than 50 countries, 
Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel¬†but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, futurist, and professor at the City College of New York. He is the author of many fascinating books on the nature of our reality and the future of our civilization.

10 Crazy Things Ancient People Actually Did,"10 strange facts about ancient people that will amaze you and make you say ‚ÄúWOW!‚Äù Have you ever heard about any of them?

As technologies and new research methods develop, we are learning more and more about ancient people and their customs. However, the more we learn about their lives, the more this knowledge shocks us because some of the things our ancient predecessors did seem too bizarre even for the most open-minded person today. 

TIMESTAMPS
Women used lead and sulfur to dye their hair 0:47
Glass balls and ground rubber were used as breast implants 1:53
Animal droppings were used for medical purposes 2:47
Doctors drilled holes in people‚Äôs heads to release evil spirits 3:52
Women were hired to cry at funerals 4:47
Fathers could legally kill their daughters‚Äô lovers 5:20
In ancient Rome, fathers could sell their sons into slavery 6:03
Doctors used garlic to test for pregnancy 6:49
Ancient Egyptians shaved off their eyebrows to mourn their cats 7:45
There were public bathrooms in ancient Rome 8:44

SUMMARY
- Ancient people used to use plant materials to dye their hair, but the effect didn‚Äôt last long, and as you know, there were much more important things to do than to care about your hair color. That‚Äôs why the Greeks and the Romans used a permanent hair dye that consisted of different toxic chemicals, including sulfur. 
- Some women put topical treatments or homemade creams on their bosoms to make them bigger. Others massaged coconut oil into their skin. But these methods aren‚Äôt all that radical. The first breast reconstructive surgery wasn‚Äôt performed until 1895 by Doctor Vincenz Czerny. 
- In ancient Egypt, warriors applied animal excrement to their wounds! If you think that‚Äôs crazy, check out our video about 14 Strange Ways of Life the Ancient Egyptians Practiced! 
- Doctors have always been fascinated with the human body and tried different methods to cure illnesses. Drilling holes, or ‚Äútrepanation‚Äù, was one of them, and doctors used to believe that it could remedy such ailments as seizures, headaches, and infections. 
- In Ancient Rome, many families hired special women to weep at funerals in order to impress the crowd. They usually followed the procession, and to make their grief believable, the women would scratch at their cheeks to draw blood and rip out their hair.  
- Fathers had a very strong influence on the entire family and especially on their unmarried daughters. In fact, they had the right to choose a good husband for them. 
- The father was the head of the family and possessed absolute power over his wife and children. So, they also had the right to decide whether or not to keep newborn babies in the family. If they chose not to, they could sell their sons into slavery. If the person who bought the slave didn‚Äôt need him anymore, the sons could go back to their parent‚Äôs home. 
- The lack of detailed medical knowledge of anatomy didn‚Äôt allow doctors to say for sure why some women could get pregnant while others couldn‚Äôt. Because of this, they tried different natural ways to test for pregnancy. 
- Ancient Egyptian families mourned the death of a family cat by shaving off their eyebrows. The cat‚Äôs body was embalmed and adorned with a wood-carved mask. Then the tiny cat mummy was placed in a family tomb or in a cat cemetery. 
- People in ancient Rome used all possible means to take care of their personal hygiene. They regularly visited public baths and toilets and used cleansers and bath sponges.

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. She's math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she's prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar¬Æ nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. But when she breaks her mom's #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award¬Æ winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There's one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school's beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt's Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains How We See Colors,"Is that apple in your hand really red? Or is it another color? Or is it even a color? On this StarTalk explainer video, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are exploring how we see colors. 

Neil settles the ‚Äúblue dress vs. gold dress‚Äù debate that took the internet by storm a few years back. We reflect on the relationship between scientific advancements and our physiological senses. You‚Äôll learn why things are different colors. We discuss white light. 

Neil explains why, if you‚Äôre holding a red apple in your hand, the apple is not actually red. What happens if you take a red apple up to a light that has no red in it? What color would the apple be? All that, plus, we talk about ‚Äúdark adaptation‚Äù and how it impacts the way we see colors in the dark.

Sinking Sundarbans - Climate voices from India,"http://www.greenpeace.org/voices

At the mouth of the Ganges River lies the Sundarbans - 20,000 square kilometres of Unesco protected Mangrove forest stretching between India and Bangladesh. It is home to 500 endangered Bengali tigers, countless crocodiles and around 4.3 million people.

Experiencing sea-level rise faster than any other place on Earth, these fragile islands are disappearing quickly. In last 20 years four islands have been submerged leaving 6,000 families displaced. It is estimated that 30,000 people will lose their homes by 2020 as 15 percent of the Sundarbans habitable land will be gone.

Increased frequency and strength of tropical storms and higher tides are making the people of the Sundarbans victims of climate change. This is their story.

Ghoramora : 'The river has eaten my land' - BBC News,"Thousands of people still live on the Indian island of Ghoramora, which has shrunk in size to just 4.5 sq km.

It's one of scores of low-lying islands in the Sundarbans Delta that are rapidly disappearing.

Scientists say global warming has caused melting snow and ice to swell the rivers, and the sea level has risen.
Tens of thousands have fled Ghoramora in recent decades.

Smoke & Fire! NASA Tests the World's Most Powerful Rocket,"NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket's core stage fired all four of its RS-25 engines on March 18th at Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.

The core stage includes the liquid hydrogen tank and liquid oxygen tank, four RS-25 engines, and the computers, electronics, and avionics that serve as the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of the rocket. 

The hot fire was the final test of the Green Run series. The term ‚Äúgreen‚Äù refers to the new hardware that will work together to power the stage, and ‚Äúrun‚Äù refers to operating all the components together simultaneously for the first time. For the test, the 212-foot core stage generated 1.6 million pounds of thrust, while anchored in the B-2 Test Stand at NASA‚Äôs Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The hot fire test included loading 733,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen ‚Äì mirroring the launch countdown procedure ‚Äì and igniting the engines.

Artemis I will be the first in series of increasingly complex missions, testing the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft as an integrated system ahead of crewed flights to the Moon. Under the Artemis program, NASA is working to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon. SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the Moon on a single mission.

How Dinosaurs Could Have Evolved If They Never Went Extinct,"If the famous asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had changed its course just a bit, then dinosaurs would have remained the dominant species. Evolution would have played out differently for them. Maybe during those millions of years, humans would not have evolved to be on top of the food chain. If dinosaurs had evolved as humans did, then we'd have to compete with them. But what would they look like, and how dangerous would they be to us?

Twitter whistleblower raises security concerns - BBC News,"A former security chief for Twitter has turned whistleblower and testified that the company misled users and US regulators about gaps in its security.

Peiter Zatko also claimed that Twitter underestimated how many fake and spam accounts are on its platform.

The accusations could affect a legal battle between Twitter and billionaire Elon Musk, who is trying to cancel his $44bn (¬£37bn) deal to buy the company.

Twitter says Mr Zatko's allegations are inaccurate and inconsistent.

It says he was sacked in January for ineffective leadership and poor performance.

Waitangi Day: Thousands gather in New Zealand with MƒÅori rights in focus | BBC News,"Thousands of people have attended events in Waitangi, in northern New Zealand, to celebrate the country's national day amid a debate over the future of its founding document.
 
Waitangi Day marks the first signing of New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi or Te Tiriti o Waitangi in MƒÅori between the British Crown and MƒÅori chiefs in 1840.
 
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon - who attended an event in the South Island - described the day as an opportunity to reflect on New Zealand's past as it charts its future.
 
But this year's events come at a time of increased tensions, as the government pursues policies considered by some to be anti-MƒÅori.

Dominic Fike - King of Everything (Live | Vevo DSCVR),"Dominic Fike ‚Äì ‚ÄúKing of Everything‚Äù (Vevo DSCVR)

Sometimes less is more. Dominic Fike didn't have any tracks on the InterWebs when his name starting rolling off the tongues of South Florida-based fans and prescient music industry types last year. Evidently the singer-rapper and his brain trust thought scarcity would attract some big fish. Score one for brain trusts. His wildly catchy music is now being delivered by the Columbia label and the Team Fike is on the runway to success. You CAN hear his tracks these days. Check ""Phone Numbers,"" ""Rollerblades,"" and ""A√ßa√≠ Bowl"" for a taste of his totally smooth, cooly vibey approach. A Jack Johnson fan who knows his way around hazy hip-hop, he personalized blend of the two is fetching. He shows us his one-man-band side in this ""King of Everything"" DSCVR performance. Looping instrumental motifs and snaking his vocals through the action suits him well.

Russia's billion-dollar bridge to Crimea - BBC News,"Russia has begun construction work on a bridge to Crimea, after its annexation from Ukraine. The multi-billion dollar project started two years ago after Russia seized control of the region following an unrecognised referendum on self-determination. The bridge is scheduled to open in 2018, and will provide a land and rail link across the Black Sea from the town of Taman, on the Russian mainland, to the Crimean port of Kerch.

Zimbabwe to return land seized from foreign farmers - BBC News,"Zimbabwe has offered to return land to foreign nationals whose farms were seized under a controversial government programme two decades ago.
Thousands of white farmers were forced from their land, often violently, between 2000 and 2001.
The seizures were meant to redress colonial-era land grabs but contributed to the country's economic decline and ruined relations with the West.
A separate compensation scheme has been launched for local white farmers.
They have not been offered land, but the government last month promised them $3.5bn (¬£2.6bn) for seized infrastructure.

Carmen DeLeon - B√©same Bonito (Live | Vevo DSCVR),"Carmen DeLeon - B√©same Bonito. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

Colombia gets plenty of shine as the leading exporter of Latin pop, but it shares an eastern border with another heavyweight. In the last decade, Venezuela has produced an array of artists - multi-hyphenate star Danny Ocean, hermano duo Mau y Ricky, and influencer/singer Lele Pons to name a few - who have made major imprints on the Latin pop zeitgeist. Carmen DeLeon is determined to join those ranks. Splashing around in various dembow-based sounds, her dusky voice is ultra pliable. Need some reggaeton feels? Try this year‚Äôs ‚ÄúMala Memoria,‚Äù produced by her frequent collaborator Andres Torres, one of the producers behind the ultimate Latin pop crossover of the 2010s, ‚ÄúDespacito.‚Äù How about some bright beats with acoustic guitar? Turn up the Tainy-produced ‚ÄúVolver√°s.‚Äù A simmering ballad? There‚Äôs ‚ÄúB√©same Bonito."" DeLeon says she owes her versatility and experimentation to a childhood in which she lived not only in Caracas, but Miami and Barcelona, too. Now based in South Beach, the 21-year-old is crafting herself as a bilingual pop threat. These DSCVR performances of ‚ÄúB√©same Bonito‚Äù and ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äù are irresistible. The latter track is her first single to be sung in English, but both will knock you off your feet regardless what language you speak.

Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus leaked from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and more work was needed to identify the source of the virus.

Rotating polygons 180 degrees about their center | Transformations | Geometry | Khan Academy,"Watch the next lesson: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/transformations/transformations-symmetry/v/constructing-quad-based-on-symmetry?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=Geometry

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

The birds on the balcony that found TikTok fame - BBC News,"Katrina Smith was living a city lifestyle in Melbourne, Australia, when Covid hit. Fearing a lockdown, she packed up and rented a place on the Surf Coast of Victoria.

She started posting videos of the birds that showed up on her balcony. Those birds quickly found online fame, notching up millions of views on TikTok and Instagram.

Now she's left with the dilemma of whether or not to return to the city at all.

Washington air disaster was ‚Äúpreventable‚Äù says US government | BBC News,"The US Transport Secretary has said the crash between a helicopter and passenger jet approaching Washington DC was ‚Äúabsolutely preventable‚Äù.

The plane was carrying 64 passengers and crew when it crashed into the Potomac River after the collision, along with the military helicopter. The helicopter had three people on board, who were labelled a ""fairly experienced crew"" by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Figure skaters from the US and Russia were among passengers on the aeroplane, according to officials from US Figure Skating and a club in Boston.

Authorities searching the freezing waters of the Pototomac say there are no survivors and they are conducting a recovery operation.

Phuket Food: Curry and Salad at Krua Charifa (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ü‡πä‡∏∞‡∏Æ‡πå),"One of the best reasons to go to Phuket is for the food. Read more about this restaurant here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/05/krua-chirafa-halal-food-phuket/

There are many amazing restaurants to eat at in Phuket, and what I really like is that there is such a wide variety of food available. Phuket has had many influences over the years, from the Portuguese to Chinese, and so it has created a unique and appetizing set of cuisine available. But still, one of my favorite styles of Phuket food is local Malay style food. Located right across the street from one of the main markets in the city is a restaurant called Krua Charifa (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ü‡πä‡∏∞‡∏Æ‡πå) that serves an array of Halal Thai food.

When I walked into the restaurant I immediately got a whiff of curry leaves, a leaf that smells exactly like a pungent pot of curry. In Thai they are called bai mui (‡πÉ‡∏ö‡∏´‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏¢), and from that aroma I knew they were going to serve good food. Curry leaves in Thailand are quite rare to find, only occasionally available in the south, but mostly I‚Äôve tried them in Sri Lanka and Malaysia, used in south Indian cooking. Anyway, when I walked into Krua Charifa (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ü‡πä‡∏∞‡∏Æ‡πå), the smell of curry leaves took over my nostrils and I could wait to order and eat. The restaurant is a khao gaeng restaurant, meaning they have rice and curry. All the dishes are pre-made ahead of time, and you just walk up to the front of the restaurant and see what‚Äôs available and then order what looks the best. 

The first food I ordered was gaeng gari pla (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏£‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤), a type of curry with fish, and that‚Äôs where the curry leaves were coming from. The curry was a little on oily side, but wow was it incredibly well flavored. I could taste the turmeric and the blend of dry spices, and the fish was soft and filled with flavor too. The curry leaves came in strongly and what I really loved in the curry were the pieces of eggplant that were filled with the curry sauce. It‚Äôs easily one of the best tasting versions of gaeng gari pla (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏£‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤) that I‚Äôve had in a long time. Along with the gaeng gari pla (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏£‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤), I got a plate of pad ped pla kraben (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏ô), a style of southern Thai curry that‚Äôs fried with curry paste. This version was made with stingray, which is commonly found in the south of Thailand as well as in Malaysia and Singapore. Stingray has a very firm texture almost like chicken breast. It was very good and the flavor was again filled with spice and delicious. The final food we ordered at Krua Charifa (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ü‡πä‡∏∞‡∏Æ‡πå) was Yam Phuket (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏†‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ï) a Phuket style salad. The salad included small fried fish, fried coconut, and then slices of green mango. It was another excellent dish. Everything we ate was wonderful.

If you‚Äôre looking for local Malay Phuket food that‚Äôs also Halal, when you‚Äôre in Phuket Town, this is a wonderful place to eat. Here are the details:

Concerns that Eid would lead to Covid spike in Pakistan - BBC News,"As its neighbouring country India succumbs to a devastating Covid crisis, fears rise in Pakistan in the run up to Eid.
 It was shortly after Eid last year that Pakistan's hospitals first struggled to cope with the influx of Covid patients.
 The period leading up to the festival, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan is usually the busiest of the year for retailers.  But a partial lockdown began at the weekend and will last until next week. All non-essential businesses have been closed, while domestic tourism has been banned. 
Officials hope that reducing transmission rates now will not only save lives but also prevent further, more stringent lockdowns. 

 The greater challenge will be posed by families holding their own private gatherings as they traditionally would to celebrate Eid.

Syrian rebels close in on Homs | BBC News,"Syrian anti-government rebels were closing in on the city of Homs on Friday, as they gained new ground in a fresh offensive against President Bashar al-Assad.
 
This has led to tens of thousands of people fleeing Homs, Syria's third-largest city.

The rebels seized Hama to the north on Thursday, a second major blow to President Bashar al-Assad who lost control of Aleppo last week.
 
Their goal is to overthrow Assad's regime, the leader of Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said.
 
Meanwhile, Kurdish-led forces have also reportedly seized control of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria.

Artemis II Rocket Stacking Begins at NASA's Kennedy Space Center,"Engineers and technicians with NASA‚Äôs Exploration Ground Systems Program completed stacking of the first Moon rocket segments ‚Äì the left and right aft assemblies for the agency‚Äôs Artemis II SLS (Space Launch System) solid rocket boosters ‚Äì onto mobile launcher 1 inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.

The first two of 10 booster segments to be stacked, the boosters will help support the remaining rocket components and the Orion spacecraft during final assembly of the Artemis II Moon rocket. When assembled, each booster will be about half the length of a football field, and will generate more thrust than 14 four-engine jumbo commercial airliners - providing more than 75 percent of the total SLS thrust during liftoff from Kennedy‚Äôs Launch Pad 39B.

George Floyd death: New charges for all four sacked officers - BBC News,"New charges have been announced against all of the sacked police officers present at the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder, court documents show.

The other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder.

Floyd's death has sparked huge protests across the US against racism and the police killings of black Americans.

Or eight centerfold baddie Jane Does
Or eight million sold, or my bank rolls
Move in step with the truth watch me tango
Is it me or do they keep frontin‚Äô like they‚Äôre on the winning team?
This the kind of comeback that belongs on silver screens
I know I talk like I‚Äôm crazy
If they‚Äôre what you call sane, then I may be
Might run, but we pacing
The score getting run up, I‚Äôm patient
I know my squad, it ain‚Äôt up right now
Still I bow, cause he gon‚Äô turn it upside down

Down bad, still gotta stand up
All bad, Dirty Diana
Photo finish, show me where the camera
I don‚Äôt even wait to raise the banner, throw that
Confetti-etti-etti everywhere, everywhere
It‚Äôs confetti-etti-etti everywhere, everywhere
Floating, floating, floating in the air, in the air
It‚Äôs confetti-etti-etti everywhere, everywhere

Up, up looking up like it‚Äôs
Acts 1 but it‚Äôs rough stride is
By faith, never luck, sight is
So tough, nearsighted, can‚Äôt bluff
We really came up
The way they run they mouth, you‚Äôd have thought we gave up
They sound like a joke, where they villain makeup?
When it‚Äôs finished they can‚Äôt make me and winning break up
Though for now it‚Äôs

Down bad, still gotta stand up
All bad, Dirty Diana
Photo finish, show me where the camera
I don‚Äôt even wait to raise the banner, throw that
Confetti-etti-etti everywhere, everywhere
It‚Äôs confetti-etti-etti everywhere, everywhere
Floating, floating, floating in the air, in the air

Ok I never been the man in the first place

You would show me light and bring me first aid 
Birthplace we gon‚Äô bring it right back to the first page 
They gon‚Äô hear His name let it continue as the verse plays 
Boy you know we stepping in favor
Tell me what‚Äôs a king to a boy in a manger
Whole life changed when I met with The Maker

RealestK - Toxic (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"RealestK - Toxic. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

A mysterious vibe surrounds RealestK. Thick frames obscure his eyes; shoulder-length curls frame the rest of his face. All five of his music videos take place at what looks like 1am, the lights of city buildings reflecting on his lenses. The 17-year-old calls himself ‚ÄúToronto‚Äôs Secret‚Äù for a reason. Understand this: The quasi-anonymity is a concerted effort, reminiscent of his sonic and geographic kin PARTYNEXTDOOR and The Weeknd. What‚Äôs less mysterious is RealestK's rapid ascendance as a need-to-know name in the R&B world. Everybody understands the depth of TikTok‚Äôs curatorial powers by now, and a couple months ago the Canadian singer's ‚ÄúWFM‚Äù really hit home on the app. All the hallmarks of a TikTok hit were there: enticing melody,  groovable beat, cohesive vibe. So now we‚Äôre letting everyone get to know him a little better - that‚Äôs the essence of DSCVR. Live takes of ‚ÄúWFM‚Äù and ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù put his whole vocal repertoire out there, from his weary whispers to his rich croon. An impressive display for someone his age. He may still be mysterious, but that talent is no secret.

Much Needed Care for Sexual Violence Survivors in Nairobi

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

"If You See a Service Dog Alone, Don‚Äôt Ignore It","How to Deal with Service Dogs. What would you do if a dog wearing some sort of vest randomly approached you without an owner in sight? Pet it, call animal control, or ignore it? Today‚Äôs video will certainly teach you a thing or two when it comes to service dogs. These sorts of dogs are totally misunderstood and underestimated. No, they‚Äôre not just pets for disabled people, they don‚Äôt want your belly rubs or treats, and you absolutely should NOT ignore one if it approaches you without its owner around.

TIMESTAMPS
What service dogs are. 1:22
What if a service dog approaches you without its owner? 2:42
What if a service dog is with its owner? 4:23
Let the service dog perform its job alone. 6:22
Can I talk to service dog handlers? 7:12
Where are service dogs allowed? 8:15
Is it okay to ask someone for some legal documentation proving that their service dog is legit? 10:44

SUMMARY
-The Americans with Disabilities Act (or ADA) puts it like this: a service dog is ‚Äúany dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability.‚Äù
-This special dog wants your undivided attention because its handler needs help! It might be an emergency situation in which its owner needs human assistance that the dog can‚Äôt provide.
-The law mandates that you never ever interact with a service dog while they‚Äôre with their owners. These dogs have a job to do, they‚Äôre on the clock, they don‚Äôt need you disturbing them during working hours, and the law totally agrees.
-You must NOT approach or attempt to help, even if you see a dog pulling a wheelchair or giving its owner medicine. This animal is literally an expert when it comes to serving its owner and responding to their needs.
-Talk to service dog handlers like any other individual, and don‚Äôt violate their privacy, especially when it comes to the details of their disability and their service dog.
-Service animals are allowed in places that the general public uses as long as they‚Äôre accompanied by their handler. These places include parks, restaurants, shops, and even public transportation.
-Under federal law, to ask someone for some legal documentation proving that their service dog is legit is not allowed and the owner is not obligated to do so.

"In Haiti, MSF Treats People Injured by Violence Between Armed Groups","In Haiti‚Äôs capital, Port-au-Prince, fighting between armed groups has terrorized communities, forcing some 19,000 people to flee their homes in recent months and causing pain and suffering for those caught in the crossfire. The economic and political crisis in Haiti has been worsening in recent years. The assassination of Haiti's president in July 2021 has exacerbated the instability, and a recent fuel shortage caused by tensions over the city‚Äôs port has made access to health care even more difficult. Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) staff in Port-au-Prince treat people for gunshot wounds, knife wounds, and assaults every day. Manuelle Lina arrived at MSF's Tabarre hospital after being struck by two vehicles fleeing a shootout between armed groups. She was pregnant with twins. ‚ÄúOn Wednesday evening the medical staff performed a sonogram: my little boy and girl were moving normally,‚Äù Lina said. ""By Thursday morning 10 a.m., I had lost both of them."" MSF psychologist Elkins Voltaire explained the impact that this violence is having on the mental health of patients: ‚ÄúNot only do these people have pain in their bodies, but they have it in their minds too.‚Äù Read more at https://bit.ly/30RS2Th

Artist captures how humans are reshaping the planet - BBC News,"Edward Burtynsky travels the world trying to capture striking images of humanity's impact on the planet, from the fossil-like shapes left behind by drills in a potash mine to the luminescent colours of lithium ponds.

The Canadian photographic artist has spent 40 years focusing on large-scale human activities such as mining, quarrying, agriculture and deforestation - but he says he doesn't see himself as an environmentalist.

His latest project, Anthropocene, is a collaboration with film-makers Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier, exploring the idea proposed by some scientists that a geological epoch shaped by human activity has begun.

It includes a travelling exhibition, a book and feature-length documentary, which was premiered last year in Canada and goes on theatrical release in the US next week.

Why This Japanese City Banned Bright Colors,"Kyoto, a beautiful city in Japan, has banned bright colors to preserve its traditional charm. The city's rich history and ancient architecture are best complemented by muted tones that reflect its cultural heritage. By keeping buildings and signs in more subdued colors, Kyoto maintains a serene and classic atmosphere. This helps both locals and visitors feel like they're stepping back in time when they walk through the streets. It makes Kyoto very different from Japan's capital, Tokyo. Let's compare them!

Lyrics:

A great light dawns in Galilee 
Some say mad man 
Some say King
Wonder working rebel priest
Jesus Christ the Nazarene 

He knew well what it would take
To free us all from sin and grave
A perfect man would have to die
And only He could pay that price

Friday‚Äôs good cause Sunday is coming
Don‚Äôt lose hope cause Sunday is coming
Devil you‚Äôre done 
You better start running
Friday‚Äôs good cause Sunday is coming

So He let those soldiers take Him in
As His friend betrayed Him with a kiss
There before the mocking crowd
Like a lamb to the slaughter didn‚Äôt make a sound
Then He carried that cross to Calvary 
And He shed His blood to set us free
As the nails went in and the sky went dark
The redemption of the world was on His heart

Friday‚Äôs good cause Sunday is coming
Don‚Äôt lose hope cause Sunday is coming
Devil you‚Äôre done 
You better start running
Friday‚Äôs good cause Sunday is coming

Then He breathed His last
And bowed His head
The Son of God and man was dead
With bloody hands
Tears on their face
They laid Him down
Inside that grave
But that wasn‚Äôt the end
That wasn‚Äôt the end
That wasn‚Äôt the end
Let me tell you what happened next
The women came before the dawn
To find that stone already gone
When they looked inside the angel said
Why you looking for the living among the dead
He‚Äôs alive
He‚Äôs alive
Hallelujah He‚Äôs alive
Give Him praise
Lift Him high
Hallelujah He‚Äôs alive
He‚Äôs alive
He‚Äôs alive
Hallelujah He‚Äôs alive
Give Him praise
Lift Him high
Hallelujah He‚Äôs alive
Hallelujah hallelujah
Don‚Äôt lose hope cause Sunday‚Äôs coming
Hallelujah hallelujah

Now Jesus reigns 
Upon the throne
All Heaven sings
To Him alone
We watch and wait
Like a bride for a groom
Oh church arise
He‚Äôs coming soon

India election results 2019: Narendra Modi takes landslide win - BBC News,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has secured another five-year term after winning a landslide general election victory.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

The governing BJP of Narendra Modi has swept back to victory with a resounding majority of well over 300 seats
The result is a major blow for Rahul Gandhi's Congress, which once dominated Indian politics
The election was seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, a polarising figure adored by many but also blamed for divisions
With 900 million eligible voters, the election for India's lower house of parliament was the largest vote the world had seen
More than 2,000 parties and 8,000 candidates are contesting 543 seats. A party or coalition needs at least 272 MPs to form a government",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKMDbNzbWJM

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Lyrics:
I don‚Äôt know who I am sometimes
I wish life was a straight line
Where do I belong in the scheme of things?
Is there something that I‚Äôm just missing?
 
Just don‚Äôt hold back
 
CHORUS:
I‚Äôve been in it so deep
Everything‚Äôs not as it seems
Apart of me has to die
The worlds been bleeding me dry
I‚Äôve been living through pain
But I ain‚Äôt gotta live this way
God, I need You now
Will you lift me while I‚Äôm this far down?
This far down?
 
Not every thought‚Äôs gonna lead to life
Maybe I‚Äôm scared of a paper knife
Just like my father used to say
Little things matter on the bad days
 
Just go with me

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 


M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

LIFE-SAVING GADGETS and EMERGENCY HACKS YOU SHOULD KNOW,"Emergency hacks for all occasions

Hello everyone! Today we wanted to share some essential survival tips and hacks that one day may save your life (or at least help you feel comfortable in some situations). 
First of all, we will show you a bunch of useful emergency hacks for parents. For example, if your kids get a slight injury while playing at the playground, you can use a tampon to stop the blood. If it happens at home, you can freeze a pack of marshmallows or other snacks and use it to reduce the bruise. 
When you wear new shoes, usually, after a couple of hours, you can't even take a step cause your feet are hurting. Prevent blisters on your feet with bra pads. With them, you won't experience any shoes rubbing anymore ;) 
If you saw a splinter under your skin, you can easily remove it with this clever hack. First, cover the splinter and skin around it with a liquid black mask. Let it dry, and then you can easily take it out! Another simple way to solve this problem is to use a syringe!

Lyrics:
I hear you, respect
Go build
A narrative for yourself
The one voice you're listening to
Could set it all apart
In the crowded hell outside your mouth
But tell me not to feel everything
I can't, can't, can't
And I could understand anything you‚Äôd need now
Except for you to vanish in your final act.

how much violence can silence create?
is emptiness the heaviest weight?
if you leave me sinking and just stand in the wake
who am i to judge the call you make

and you‚Äôll be like, out of sight out of mind
but i‚Äôm right here all the time
you‚Äôll keep it moving on like, oh it's all fine
but you know nothing disappears when you turn out a light- right?

When I gave you everything
As it turns out, you didn't need everything
Ooh, did it satisfy anything
To cut it out, to shut me down?

Where are you now

Where are you now

Where are you now?
That I'll believe in everything
And I tore it all apart
The residue breaking my back
I had an attitude
And you can't, can't, can't stand that
I hear you, respect your solitude
But was it poetry when you told me you would be right back

how much violence can silence create?
is emptiness the heaviest weight?
if you leave me sinking and just stand in the wake
who am i to judge the call you make

and you'll be like, out of sight out of mind
but i'm right here all the time
youll keep it moving on like, oh it's all fine
but you know nothing disappears when you turn out a light- right?

Get yourself into something deep
But then you wanna make it easier
One solution is to separate
Mine is always to go deeper

how much violence can silence create?
is emptiness the heaviest weight?
if you leave me sinking and just stand in the wake
who am i to judge the call you make

and you‚Äôll be like, out of sight out of mind
but i‚Äôm right here all the time
you‚Äôll keep it moving on like, oh it's all fine
but you know nothing disappears when you turn out a light- right?

"Insight: Haiti - ""Madame, here is your baby""","Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) makes it a priority to provide life-saving, emergency obstetric care in both acute and chronic humanitarian crises. Fifteen percent of all pregnancies worldwide will experience a life-threatening complication. The most critical moment is delivery: the majority of maternal deaths occur just before, during, or just after delivery, often from complications that cannot be predicted. It is at this point that the provision of quality obstetric care is vital to save women's lives. The majority of maternal deaths are avoidable when access to emergency obstetric care is ensured.",Nonprofits & Activism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQAf8njUftM

Inside the Vulcan bomber's cockpit - BBC News,"The last flying Vulcan bomber will take to the skies for the final time before the end of the month. It causes a stir every time it flies due to its unique shape and earth shaking roar. It has been hugely popular at airshows for several years and is best known for carrying out the longest ever raid of its kind during the Falklands War in 1982. But experts say it has to stop flying.
Danny Savage got a tour of the cockpit from Chief Pilot Martin Withers at its base at Robin Hood Airport near Doncaster.

He gon‚Äô make a way, make a way, make a, I know He will

Think of what I could been
I‚Äôm a living witness that

Only for a night
Don‚Äôt let the storm dim your light
Joy‚Äôs coming for sure
It‚Äôll be alright
  
When I think about Jesus
And all that He‚Äôs done for me
My soul cries out
Cause I already got the victory 
Tried in the fire
Came out as pure gold
Tried Him for, myself and now I know
 
I know He will will will
I know He will will will
I know He will will will
Work it out just for you
I know He will
God will get you through
I know will
 
Let me a witness of all His goodness
Keep on pushing through this
He‚Äôs got you 
Oh whoa
 
I know He will
I know He will 
I know He will
 
Ima be be 
 
Hold on
Don‚Äôt you give up

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds‚ÄìKarp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Lyrics:
I know You are for me 
But sometimes it‚Äôs hard to believe 
That You‚Äôre working things out for me
When I can‚Äôt see,I can‚Äôt see
I‚Äôm walking with blindfolds on
But You‚Äôre more sure than the ground that I stand on 
I know that You won‚Äôt cave
You won‚Äôt cave in 

I trust You
Even when I can‚Äôt see the full plan 
Everything seems to make no sense
I know that You‚Äôre in control 
In control 
I trust you 
Even when I don‚Äôt understand 
My life is in Your hands
I know that You‚Äôre in control 
In control

You make ways out of no way 
You‚Äôve been faithful all my days
So why do I doubt when You say 
You will never leave me,You will never forsake me 
You know my every need 
Before I can say a thing 
Your promise is yes and amen 
Yes and amen

You got me 
You got me 
And You‚Äôll never let me go 
I don‚Äôt have to worry 
Don‚Äôt worry 
Cause I know You‚Äôre in control

Wheelstanding Dump Truck! Stubby Bob‚Äôs Comeback - Roadkill Ep. 52,"Bam! Stubby Bob goes big-time in this episode of Roadkill, presented by Dodge. In episode 44 of Roadkill, Mike Finnegan and David Freiburger took a 1950 Ford F6 dump truck and shortened the wheelbase to just 102 inches so it would look freaky-cool‚Äîbut the truck wasn‚Äôt road trip‚Äìready by the end of the show. This time, the truck is transformed by a supercharged big-block Chevy in the back with a Gearstar 4L80E transmission and a V-drive from a boat‚Äîall set up like a ‚Äô60s dragstrip exhibition wheelstander. But as the buildup continues, the big question is whether the weight balance and the massive dualie tires will really allow the truck to jerk the wheels off the pavement or not. The answer is some action you can‚Äôt miss. Roadkill is supported by Optima Batteries, CRC Industries, Lincoln Tech, Cooper Tire, Pioneer, and Jegs! We also thank Weiand, Gearstar, and Slims Fab Farm for help with parts for this episode.

Love Without Borders: The Story of Yoeuth and Chamroeun Who Fell in Love After Working with MSF,"Yoeuth was just five years old when the Khmer Rouge seized power in Cambodia in 1975. During the turmoil that followed, she was separated from her family and alone. She joined others fleeing through the woods. ‚ÄúWe ran away from the shells and couldn‚Äôt sleep at night,‚Äù she said. She eventually reached the refugee camps in Thailand. In 1987, when Yoeuth had just turned 17, she started studying everything she could on anatomy, basic health care, and midwifery at the hospital that Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) had set up in the Khao Dang refugee camp.

Around that time, Chamroeun Ros also fled Cambodia and ended up at the same camp. He was interested in becoming a health worker and was being trained to work as a pharmacist by MSF. ‚ÄúI worked in the same place as Yoeuth and was interested in her. I knew that she had been separated from her parents since the time of Pol Pot. I fell in love,‚Äù he said.

However, Yoeuth didn‚Äôt notice Chamroeun and longed to return to Cambodia. In 1991, when the war between Vietnam and Cambodia ended, she returned alone. A few years later, Chamroeun returned and started looking for her by reaching out to friends. ‚ÄúI eventually met her and took her out to eat. We have been together ever since,‚Äù he said. 

Together, they began working for MSF again in the Banteay Meanchey province to provide medical care for people living with HIV and AIDS. ‚ÄúWe reached out especially to sex workers in the area and helped them make appointments for health check-ups at the clinic,‚Äù said Yoeuth. Chamroeun was again hired as a pharmacist and stock keeper. They worked with MSF until the early 2000s and have worked for other health care providers since then. They have now been married for 27 years and live with their three children in Cambodia. Read more at https://bit.ly/3sCfj5c

Ethiopia: More Aid Urgently Needed for Those Displaced in Afar,"Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) is witnessing a deadly and escalating nutritional crisis in Ethiopia‚Äôs Afar region, requiring a major humanitarian response. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled conflict in Afar and are now facing drought, hunger, and an extreme lack of access to health care, along with the host communities.¬†

‚ÄúThis upscale of humanitarian assistance to Afar needs to happen now, should have happened yesterday,‚Äù said Raphael Veicht, MSF emergency coordinator in Addis Ababa. Since April, MSF has been increasing its support to Dupti Hospital, which serves a population of more than 1.1 million people including hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

The 21st Century Cures Act: Implications for Research and Drug Development,"The passage of the 21st Century Cures Act has drawn both applause and criticism. A sweeping bipartisan effort with multiple components, the law dramatically boosts funding for medical research, particularly in areas such as cancer and brain disease. The law also relaxes regulatory processes for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In doing so, the law‚Äôs supporters point to the potential for faster treatments benefiting from a streamlined approval process. Critics raise concerns that safety and efficacy might be compromised, with potentially devastating consequences. And the law also has been questioned for failing to explicitly address high drug prices, a growing public issue. These debates are unfolding as the Trump administration is expected to imminently announce its choice for a new FDA commissioner, who will head an agency directly impacted by the Cures act. In this Forum, experts will explore the implications of the law for biomedicine, regulation, pharmaceuticals and patient advocacy.

This Forum event was presented jointly with STAT on February 27, 2017.

Lyrics

I tell myself you don't mean a thing,
And what we got, got no hold on me
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much,
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch,

Only love, only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away,
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay,
And when you come close I just tremble
And every time, every time you go,
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this,
Must have been a deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this

Your kisses burn into my skin,
Only love can hurt like this
But it's the sweetest pain,
Burning hot through my veins,
Love is torture makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Must have been a deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,

Only love can hurt like this,
Your kisses burn into my skin,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt
Save me, save me,
Only love, only love,
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And it must have been a deadly kiss",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKr9gWqwl4

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Pulwama attack: India will 'completely isolate' Pakistan - BBC News,"India has said it will ensure the ""complete isolation"" of Pakistan after a suicide bomber killed 46 soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Federal Minister Arun Jaitley said India would take ""all possible diplomatic steps"" to cut Pakistan off from the international community.

India accuses Pakistan of failing to act against the militant group which said it carried out the attack.

This is the deadliest attack to hit the disputed region in decades.

Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but only control parts of it.

What If Jeep-Sized Spiders Appeared on Earth,"The biggest spider people know about is the South American Goliath birdeater.  This puppy-sized arachnid usually has a foot-long leg span. Its body is the size of a large fist, and its weight is more than 6 ounces. When the creature's moving, it makes bizarre, eerie sounds. They're the clicking of the spider's feet. They have hardened tips that hit the ground like a horse's hooves - just not as loud.   

This spider is one of the most dangerous creatures in the world. It protects itself by sending out clouds of hairs that have microscopic barbs on them. If they got in your eyes and nose, they'd be super painful and itchy. These hairs would also stay there for hours or even days. That sounds extremely unsettling. But imagine what our planet would look like if spiders were the size of jeeps! Yeah, the world occupied by giant arachnids would bw a dark and gloomy place...

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
In the new action comedy from DreamWorks Animation, based on the New York Times best-selling book series, a crackerjack criminal crew of animal outlaws are about to attempt their most challenging con yet--becoming model citizens. Never have there been five friends as infamous as The Bad Guys--dashing pickpocket Mr. Wolf (Academy Award¬Æ winner Sam Rockwell, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), seen-it-all safecracker Mr. Snake (Marc Maron, GLOW), chill master-of-disguise Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson, Hot Tub Time Machine franchise), short-fused ""muscle"" Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos, In the Heights) and sharp-tongued expert hacker Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina, Crazy Rich Asians), aka ""Webs."" But when, after years of countless heists and being the world's most-wanted villains, the gang is finally caught, Mr. Wolf brokers a deal (that he has no intention of keeping) to save them all from prison: The Bad Guys will go good. Under the tutelage of their mentor Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade, Paddington 2), an arrogant (but adorable!) guinea pig, The Bad Guys set out to fool the world that they've been transformed. Along the way, though, Mr. Wolf begins to suspect that doing good for real may give him what he‚Äôs always secretly longed for: acceptance. So when a new villain threatens the city, can Mr. Wolf persuade the rest of the gang to become... The Good Guys?

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. She's math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she's prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar¬Æ nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. But when she breaks her mom's #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award¬Æ winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There's one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school's beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt's Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most.

Operation to rescue civilians from besieged Ukrainian steelworks under way - BBC News,"Officials in Ukraine have said a fresh attempt to evacuate civilians trapped with Ukrainian fighters in a steelworks bombarded by Russian forces is under way. 

Buses have been sent to the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, in a rescue operation run jointly by the United Nations and the Red Cross.

There are thought to be about 200 civilians - including at least 20 children - still stuck in bunkers and maze-like tunnels under the Azovstal steel plant.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

It‚Äôs the only place in the world where you can expect to see a $40 millon 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO square-off against a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette.

While the largest chunk of cars participating will be sports cars and prototypes from the 1960s and 1970s, there is tremendous variety. Get there early enough, and you can see cars from Pre-1940 battle it out on Laguna Seca‚Äôs famed corkscrew turn, sporting wooden wheels that flex and groan over bumps and through corners.

What Happened to the Most Unfortunate Hotel in the World,"If you ever decide to set out on a Google-Maps journey around North Korea, you‚Äôll notice a long white rectangle docked at the Mount Kumgang port. That's no superyacht or ship ‚Äì it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first floating hotel! Designed in Sweden, built in Singapore, opened in Australia, relocated to Vietnam, and then on to North Korea ‚Äì the 7-story hotel has traveled around 9,000 miles within a decade! 

Back in the early ‚Äò80s, a guy named Doug Tarca decided to bring tourists to Townsville, Australia, not far from the Great Barrier Reef. Tarca used to be a professional diver and wanted to find the best way to show the famous attraction to tourists without harming the reef in any way. He first started giving tours of the reef in a catamaran with a glass bottom. A few months later, Tarca went even bigger ‚Äì he set his sights on building the world‚Äôs first floating hotel! But what went wrong with it?

Lyrics:
Nothing
 
What could I do to forfeit and lose
All of this grace that You‚Äôve given me
What could I say to push You away
God, what could make You ashamed of me
 
What could pull me from Your loving arms
What could separate me from Your heart
 
There‚Äôs nothing
There‚Äôs nothing
There‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve been through
There‚Äôs nothing I could do
That could keep me from You
That could break us apart
That could make You regret Your scars
There‚Äôs nothing
There‚Äôs nothing
 
What would You do, be willing to lose
To pay off my ransom
Everything
Where would You run to bring home Your son
When You hear me calling
Anywhere
 
The nails were never strong enough
To stop the power of Your blood
What could lock Your love away
What could stop amazing grace
What‚Äôs left inside that grave

Massachusetts' Pioneering Role Continues: Mapping a Path to Cost Containment,"The Forum at HSPH

Five years ago, Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to require that residents have health insurance. The legislation served as a model for national leaders, including President Barack Obama, as they hashed out and passed the U.S.healthcare law. This panel discussion -- Massachusetts' Pioneering Role Continues: Mapping a Path to Cost Containment -- followed a talk given by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on healthcare reform at an event by The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health.

What If the Earth Stopped Spinning Right Now,"We‚Äôve always been fascinated by what would become of Earth and us if something disastrous happened. Have you wondered about it as well? Well, that‚Äôs why Hollywood makes so many movies about the end of the world. So what would happen if Earth suddenly stopped spinning (it‚Äôs really slowing down, by the way!). Let‚Äôs have a look at the incredible consequences that might follow one day.

TIMESTAMPS:

All objects would fly east at high speed with their own momentum 0:52

Enormous tidal waves would occur 1:28

A powerful wind would rise 1:52

All water on Earth would collect in 2 oceans 2:26

Volcano eruptions, hurricanes, and earthquakes would begin 3:11

Earth would transform from a geoid into a sphere 3:40

One hemisphere would become as hot as a desert, and the other 
would be as cold as the Antarctic 4:11

The magnetic field protecting Earth from dangerous cosmic 
radiation would disappear 4:56

If people survived, it would only be on the border of heat and cold 5:29

The Moon would eventually fall onto Earth, but that wouldn‚Äôt be soon 5:59


SUMMARY:
- We don‚Äôt notice the huge speed at which the Earth is spinning. But if it stopped, says Sten Odenwald from NASA, everything on its surface would be torn off the ground and fly east, eventually falling back down. 
- The power of momentum would make the water in the seas and oceans move to form extremely powerful tsunamis. They would move east and clean the coastal cities off the face of Earth.
- The atmosphere would continue moving, and its momentum would make it rotate around the planet ‚Äî probably several times.
- A sudden stop in Earth‚Äôs spinning would make the landmasses and water redistribute themselves to form 2 great oceans on both poles. 
- The huge kinetic force of Earth and its momentum would shake the planet to its core. The result is quite predictable: all-powerful hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and destructive earthquakes would begin. Everywhere.
- If the planet stops, its shape will become more spherical.
- If Earth continued to make just one turn around the sun, only half of it would be heated. This will make it scorching hot and brightly lit with the highest temperatures at the equator. 
- If the spinning stopped, the magnetic field would also disappear. The field protects us from solar wind: the charged particles from the sun that would destroy every single living being.
- Humanity would only be able to adapt to the new conditions on the border of night and day. Humans would have to live underground and only go outside in protective suits because of radiation.
- Professor Vaughan Pratt from Stanford University says the Moon would gradually slow down, too. And its distance from Earth would reduce. In time, it would probably just fall onto our planet.
- NASA calculated that day length increases by 2.3 milliseconds every 100 years. After billions of years, days would become several times longer, and then our planet will probably stop completely.

Lyrics:
My life is a movie

So let‚Äôs get to the good part 
And passed all the non-sense 

Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening 
It‚Äôs like they want me to be perfect 
When they don‚Äôt even know that I‚Äôm hurting 
Cause life‚Äôs not easy 
I‚Äôm not made out of steel 
Don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm human, don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There‚Äôs one thing I know for sure

I‚Äôll show you 
I‚Äôll show you 
I‚Äôll show you 

I‚Äôve got to learn things 
Learn them the hard way 
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say 

Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening 
It‚Äôs like they want me to be perfect 
When they don‚Äôt even know that I‚Äôm hurting 
Cause life‚Äôs not easy 
I‚Äôm not made out of steel 
Don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm human, don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There‚Äôs one thing I know for sure

I‚Äôll show you 
I‚Äôll show you 
I‚Äôll show you 

Cause life‚Äôs not easy 
I‚Äôm not made out of steel 
Don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm human, don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There‚Äôs one thing I know for sure

Boris Johnson: Brexit plans would 'honour referendum' - BBC News,"Boris Johnson says his plan for Brexit would ""honour the referendum"".
Addressing the Commons for the first time since his proposals were submitted to the EU, the prime minister said he had always wanted to leave with a deal.
But these plans showed a ""seriousness of purpose"".
""It has not delivered everything we wished,"" says Mr Johnson.
""But it is a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm.""

Mr Johnson says the previous withdrawal agreement ""would have permanently anchored the UK within the orbit of EU regulation and customs arrangements"".

He tells MPs this government has a ""different vision"".

""We have shown great flexibility,"" he says.

""If our EU neighbours chose not to show corresponding willingness to reach a deal then we will leave on 31 October.

""It will be a failure of statecraft which all parties would be responsible.""

Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a clip every day when there is not a full length video. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel¬†but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech, specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He is the author of several popular books: one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called The Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on Quantum Mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, Ethics, Politics, Academia, and much much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he is the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

Mimi Webb - Dumb Love (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Mimi Webb - Dumb Love. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

‚ÄúYou nearly gave me a heart attack/when you said you‚Äôre doing well.‚Äù It‚Äôs gut-punching lines like this that give a edge to Mimi Webb‚Äôs pure pop confections. The hard-truth lyric above opens ‚ÄúGood Without,‚Äù a soaring power ballad that‚Äôs garnered over 60 million listens since its spring release. The Canterbury singer‚Äôs tales of love and loss usually come with ambitious pop production and strong vocal work. Trained in the arts at the famed BRIT school and influenced by Emeli Sand√©, Webb recalls the fun of being home with family as they heard ‚ÄúGood Without‚Äù for the first time. ‚ÄúMy mum was eating as we heard it, and her food just went everywhere because [we were] jumping around the kitchen!‚Äù Last year, her ‚ÄúBefore I Go‚Äù was touted by TikToker Charli D‚ÄôAmelio, and an encounter with viral fame ensued. Social media hype can be slippery, but if anyone was poised to catch and hold it, it's Webb, who had used her pandemic quarantine time to dig up emotions that were ‚Äúlong and buried,‚Äù and address them in song. These days, it‚Äôs all about letting herself shine. ‚ÄúDumb Love,‚Äù her follow-up to ‚ÄúGood Without,‚Äù also hit the UK Top 20 charts. The DSCVR performances of both are a great chance to absorb the charisma of an artist on the rise.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech, specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He is the author of several popular books: one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called The Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on Quantum Mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, Ethics, Politics, Academia, and much much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he is the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

Passenger lands Florida plane after pilot falls ill - BBC News,"A mystery passenger landed a plane solo after his pilot passed out.

The unidentified man's voice was heard in public flight recordings telling the airport tower that he had ""no idea how to stop the airplane"".

An air traffic controller who teaches new pilots helped guide the man down to Palm Beach International Airport just after noon on Tuesday.

The two met on the tarmac for a hug, but reportedly did not exchange names.

""I've got a serious situation here. My pilot has gone incoherent,"" the man was heard saying over the radio from around 9,000ft (2,750 meters) in the air. ""He is out,"" he added.

Asked for his position, he responded: ""I have no idea."" He said only that he could see the Florida coast ahead of him.

It comes after Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed 95% protection. But the Oxford jab is far cheaper and easier to store - so could play a significant role in tackling the pandemic if approved for use by regulators.

What If You Swallowed the Most Venomous Spider,"It‚Äôs been said that a person swallows about eight spiders in their sleep every year. It's hard to say if that story is true or not but it makes a kind of sense. Spiders like warm dark places and the inside of your mouth sure fits that description. Gross as it sounds, if the story‚Äôs true, it seems to be mostly harmless. 

But what if it wasn‚Äôt? What if you swallowed a spider that wasn‚Äôt just venomous, but the most toxic spider in the world? Let's find out! But please, please, don‚Äôt try this at home. Do not eat live venomous spiders!

#spiders #whatif #brightside

SUMMARY:
- This hairy little monster is known as the Sydney funnel-web spider, or ‚ÄúAtrax robustus‚Äù if you want to show off.
- The Sydney funnel-web can hold its breath for over a day, in some cases surviving underwater for up to thirty hours.  
- Atrax really don‚Äôt like to be handled, and their fangs are large and powerful enough to punch a hole in your fingernail. 
- The Atrax‚Äôs venom is a special kind of nasty, attacking its prey's nervous system. Symptoms will begin within minutes as the neurotoxin starts shorting out your nerves. 
- After being bitten, your heart will start beating rapidly as your blood pressure spikes through the roof. This is followed by breathing trouble, muscle spasms, and numbness around the mouth.
- Finally, the venom begins to attack the brain, causing disorientation and eventually loss of consciousness. In as little as fifteen minutes after the initial bite‚Ä¶
- You're in for anywhere from two to twelve injections depending on the severity of your symptoms. 
- Anyway, let‚Äôs say you managed to wrangle a Sydney funnel-web into your mouth without getting bitten. What happens then?
- For the record, something is poisonous if you get sick from eating it, and venomous if you get sick from being bitten. There may be a lot of venomous spiders, but no one‚Äôs ever found one that‚Äôs poisonous. 
- Venom is dangerous if it gets in your blood, but harmless if swallowed; although I have no idea why or how anyone would end up doing so.
- It turns out, most mammals are entirely immune to the Atrax‚Äôs venom. Only invertebrates and primates are vulnerable, anything else gets off with the equivalent of a bee sting.

Hottest January on record puzzles climate scientists | BBC News,"Last month was the world's warmest January on record and it has raised further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists said.

January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni√±o.

But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.

The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists said they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.

Lyrics:
All my words fall short
I got nothing new
How could I express
All my gratitude

I could sing these songs
As I often do
But every song must end
And You never do

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
Hallelujah
I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing hallelujah
Hallelujah

I've got one response
I've got just one move
With my arm stretched wide
I will worship You

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
Hallelujah
I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing hallelujah
Hallelujah

So come on, my soul
Don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song
'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord
Come on, my soul
Don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song
'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord
Come on, my soul
Don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song
'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord

So I throw up my hands
Praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
Hallelujah
I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing hallelujah
Hallelujah

How to Say Someone is Right? Free Spoken English Lesson,"How to Say Someone is Right? -  Free Spoken English Lesson

Blog : http://www.learnex.in/english-phrases-to-agree-spoken-english-lesson

If somebody asks 'You're an English student, aren't you?'. What will you reply ‚ÄúYes‚Äù?  In this  spoken English lesson  you will learn ten English expressions that you can use to agree with someone/ to say that this information is in fact correct.

Website : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com
Facebook Fan page : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast
Michelle's Fan Page : http://www.facebook.com/eslmichelle

Yes, that's right ‚Äì this is a general response to agree. 
Example: If someone asks you ‚ÄúAre you the sister/brother of xyz, you can say ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs right‚Äù.

You're quite right ‚Äì this is used when the person concerned is not completely right.
Example: John meets his friend Mark who is getting divorced. John tells him ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre divorced, right?‚Äù Mark replies ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite right, my divorce is in process‚Äù.

Yes, that's correct ‚Äì neutral response for agreement.
Example: Are you an English student? Yes that‚Äôs correct.

That's spot on ‚Äì mostly used to praise and agree. It is a British slang for ""well done"", ""perfect"" or ""right on‚Äù.
Example: The food in England might not always be so good, but the brew in the pubs are spot on every time.

You're dead right (there) ‚Äì used to agree with people in a meeting, discussions or general conversations.
Note: the opposite of dead right can be dead wrong
Examples:
You are dead right about his idea. It just will not work.
He is dead right. Our products are not competitive.

You've hit the nail on the head- means to be exactly right about something.
Example: Mike hit the nail on the head when he said most people can use a computer without knowing how it works.
You could say so -70 % agreement
Example: You go for a movie with your friends and after the movie one of your friend says ‚Äúthe movie was awesome‚Äù and you reply ‚Äúyou could say so‚Äù because everyone else didn‚Äôt like the movie.

I'm afraid so ‚Äì means I believe regrettably, the answer is yes.
Example: Alice: Do you have to go?
John: I‚Äôm afraid so.",Entertainment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px3esSw5Mgk

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

WHO ARE KARA AND NATE?! 
New here? We are full-time travel vloggers with a goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019. We make daily travel videos. In these videos you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit. ;)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

27 BUDGET HACKS TO UPGRADE YOUR WARDROBE,"BRILLIANT CLOTHING DIYS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

Today I show you some amazing tricks and lifehacks that will help you bring your old clothes back to life and make them fit you again. 
To make boring old shirts more interesting, take some crayons and draw on some sandpaper. Then place the paper with the drawing facing your shirt and iron it on the shirt. Then drawing will melt on the fabric and it will give it a cool design. 
Another great trick to try is to apply some fabric glue on an old sweater and then pour sequins on top. 
To decorate your black shirts, you can use bleach. Simply put on a glove, dip your hands in a bowl filled with bleach and then use your gloves as stamps on the shirts.
Another great idea is to cut up small circles from your glue gun sticks and then place them on a shirt. Then warm them up with a clothing iron by holding it on top of the shirt without touching it and voila. You can place them in order to make them resemble cherries, strawberries, or smiley faces. 
Watch until the end to see how to decorate your shirt with glue blobs and glitters.

Sanctuary 

When life is heavy and my strength is faint
There‚Äôs beauty for ashes
There‚Äôs joy in my pain
Here in the quiet, I will wait for Your hope to appear
I will wait for Your hope to appear
Near in my trials, near in my fears
Forever faithful
God, You‚Äôre in my tears
Your love is loyal, I will wait for Your hope to appear 
I will wait for Your hope to appear

We are wrapped in resurrection
You have clothed us in Your glory
Now our hearts are no longer wandering
You‚Äôve become our sanctuary

All who are wounded
You tenderly heal
For hearts that are hurting
Your grace is revealed
Burdens are lifted as the presence of Jesus appears
The hope that we prayed for is here

What once was full of sorrow
Your love turned into good
What once left me in pieces
Your strength restored in full
My trust is in Your word, Lord
You have the final say
My hope is in Your promise
That there‚Äôs an empty grave

 #MakeMoneyWatchingVideos #MakeMoneyOnline #earnmoneyonline 

I've seen many videos that promise you - just by watching YouTube videos you can make money super fast, some even claim they made almost $60  in 10 minutes. 
Sounds wild, right? Well, I'm going to try and follow the steps and see how it goes. 
Especially because in all of these videos they mention doing something on Pinterest‚Ä¶ and I happen to have published over 150 videos on my channel with Pinterest marketing tips, so kind of know the Pinterest platform inside out and it would be interesting to see if this can work!
So, here's what they tell us to do first. I need to start by exploring trending videos on YouTube.
They all suggest using vidIQ, so open the link in the description below, and start a free account, once you do that, you can download the vidIQ Free Extention and install it. 
Make sure that the extension is enabled and pinned in your browser like this.
Once you do that, go back to YouTube and you will see this VidIQ blue icon over here. The first thing I have to do is click on this Most Viewed option, and the free account you'll be able to see trending videos for the last 7 days.  
And just to let you know, the free version of VidIQ works just fine for this tutorial, but it is a great tool if you are thinking of being a serious YouTuber like me, you can do extensive keyword research for your videos, get keyword suggestions and I even get AI coaching from VidIQ with ideas and recommendations specifically for my channel.
But for now, all we need is this free Chrome extension and we can find some popular videos like this one.  
Now we need to check out 'most viewed,' focusing on views per hour. 
You can pick from the past 7 days. We're talking videos with millions of views ‚Äì like Mr Beast. 
Well, in the past 7 days it's been this video with over 373k views called My Daughter Survives WORLD'S STRICTEST PARENTS on Jordan Matter's channel. We want the most viral videos only, so let's stick to this one for now.
Now, here's the twist: the videos that we are following today says that you'll be making money by watching videos but REALLY, you're not the one watching these videos. 
Instead, your job is to attract other users to watch these viral videos. 
The idea since these videos are already going viral,  people do like them, so it should be easy to get more viewers for them. And your role is just to help boost their views and get paid for it.",Education,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-V8U3AFzg

Coronavirus: Pope demands vaccine access for the poor  - BBC News,"Pope Francis has said the world's poorest people must have access to a coronavirus vaccine if one becomes available. ""How sad it would be if access to a Covid-19 vaccine was made a priority for the richest. It would be sad if the vaccine became property of such-and-such nation and not universal for everyone,"" the Pope said during his weekly general audience from the Vatican. Teams across the world are working to develop a vaccine that will be effective against Covid-19.






Germany has reported its highest daily infection rate for the coronavirus since April
Spain and Italy also logged their highest daily figures in months on Wednesday and cases are rising steadily in France

India has reported a record daily increase of 69,652 infections on Thursday, taking the total number of cases there to 2.84 million
South Korea tightens restrictions as the country sees a spike in new cases linked mostly to a church

LYRICS:
If you've been abandoned by the ones you trust the most
And you‚Äôve built a wall around your heart to make sure no one else gets close
I could fill the air with empty words and hope that they would work
But nothing I could say would change the way you hurt
So, I won‚Äôt say another word

I‚Äôll show you the cross
With Jesus lifted high
I‚Äôll show you the grave
Where death was left behind
I‚Äôll show you a Savior
Who paid the highest cost
Show me all your scars
And I‚Äôll show you the cross

If you‚Äôre on the outside, angry and lookin‚Äô in
You don‚Äôt believe that grace could reach you in the places you have been
If all you know of truth and love are lies and hypocrites
Then nothing I could say would change the way it is
The only thing that I can do is this

I‚Äôll show you the cross
With Jesus lifted high
I‚Äôll show you the grave
Where death was left behind
I‚Äôll show you a Savior
Who paid the highest cost
Show me all your scars
And I‚Äôll show you the cross

Come as you are
Come as you are
Broken and bleeding
Come as you are
Come as you are
Find what you‚Äôre needing
Come as you are
Come as you are
If you don‚Äôt believe it

I'll show you my sins
Dead and washed away
I'll show you the grace
That led my heart to change
I'll show you a Savior who loved when I was lost
Show me all your scars

And I‚Äôll show you the cross
With Jesus lifted high
I‚Äôll show you the grave
Where death was left behind
I‚Äôll show you a Savior
Who paid the highest cost
Show me all your scars
And I‚Äôll show you the cross
Show me all your scars
And I‚Äôll show you the cross
Show me all your scars
And I‚Äôll show you the cross

ABIR - Playground - Vevo dscvr (Live),"Pay attention to those who follow the arrival of new artists, and you‚Äôll hear a name pop up repeatedly: ABIR. Pay attention to strong new songs that stick in your head, and you‚Äôll be shakin‚Äô to ‚ÄúPlayground,‚Äù the 23-year-old singer‚Äôs addictive new track and a perfect fit on any playlist that dominates your earbuds this summer. A quick history. As a kid, the Moroccan-born singer fell for the sound of Etta James while cruising with her limo-driver dad in the Virginia burbs. As a teen, she started getting serious about her own music. In 2014 she found herself on a Fabolous feature, and last year made a mark with ‚ÄúWave,‚Äù ditched the DMV, and headed to New York. Check the ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù vid; she‚Äôs stylin‚Äô strong with silver thigh-high boots and boppin‚Äô the boroughs with her squad. ABIR hit her dscvr session with a guitar AND horn section, and they finessed their way through ‚ÄúPlayground‚Äù while still putting the passion front and center. Share it with a pal asap.

That's Why Elevator Doors Have a Tiny Hole,"Today, there are more than 1 million elevators just in the US, carrying people higher and lower every day. All these elevators travel about 1 and 1/2 billion miles per year and move around 18 billion passengers. You might think that you know everything about this vertical kind of transport. But, let's say, have you ever wondered why elevator doors have small holes in them? 

Imagine getting stuck in an elevator at the most inappropriate moment of your life. An elevator arrives at your floor, but the doors wouldn't open. Something must have gone wrong with the equipment, or there has been a power failure. In this case, getting out won't be an easy feat! That's why all you can do is to wait for an elevator mechanic. Finally, they turn up, but what next?

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award¬Æ-winning director Pete Docter (‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.,‚Äù ‚ÄúUp‚Äù) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs original movie ‚Äú Inside Out,‚Äù he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all‚Äîinside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions ‚Äì Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley‚Äôs mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB1mwUC5bMs
Thailand's human trafficking trade - BBC News,"Jonathan Head has spent six months investigating the trafficking of humans in Thailand. The plight of thousands of migrants stranded on boats in the Andaman Sea has drawn global attention to a sinister trade in people, which has thrived in south east Asia. 
The decision by Thailand this month to finally move against people smugglers left hundreds of migrants drifting on boats out at sea. 
For years, though, Thailand has been accused of ignoring the trade centred inside its borders. Those affected are mostly Rohingya migrants from Myanmar, and increasingly, impoverished Bangladeshis, all seeking jobs in Malaysia. The main route has been through Thailand - where ruthless traffickers hold them until their families pay for their release.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Got knocked out seven times last year
I fell down got stuck in fear
Is this it? Is this how it all ends
Is this it?

I knew the words to tell myself
To hold it back the things I felt 
I know 
God I know

I don‚Äôt wanna stay here one more minute
I don‚Äôt wanna stay if You‚Äôre not in it
I don‚Äôt wanna wait here one more night
I don‚Äôt wanna sit here all my life
I stumbled when it came down to the wire
But I ain‚Äôt gonna cave under the pressure 
I think I‚Äôm gonna be
I think I‚Äôm gonna be ok

The motions got the best of me
And waiting showed the worst in me
Is this it
Were these just wasted years
Is this it

Is this my alibi
To make me feel alright
Is this reason why
I‚Äôm barely getting by

That's because they have a chance of disappearing in the foreseeable future. The Eiffel Tower was only meant to stand for 20 years, so rust is taking over it.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

UK vaccination to begin as it becomes first country to approve the treatment - BBC News,"The United Kingdom has become the first country in the world to approve the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. 

The vaccination programme will start shortly, with the over-80s, NHS workers, and staff in care homes at the front of the queue.  After that it will be allocated according to age and assessment of vulnerability. 

The prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that the tier system in England and the separate regimes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland remain crucial and people need to continue to follow the rules. 

The MHRA, the medicine's regulator which approved the vaccine in record time, has insisted that ‚Äúno corners‚Äù have been cut in the process of approval. 

Both Downing Street and the UK medicines regulator appeared to contradict a claim by Matt Hancock,  health secretary,  that swift approval of the vaccine had been possible because of Brexit. 

The MHRA said the supply had been authorised using provisions under existing European law which are still in place until New Years' Day. 

Rolling out the vaccine will be a huge logistical exercise which could also be affected by a post-Brexit deal as the supplies will come from Belgium.

Child Care and Health in America: Today's Challenges for Tomorrow's Children,"Description: Quality child care can help children develop lasting social, emotional, and learning skills and can promote healthy eating and play. But high-quality care, whether it comes from a nanny, a sitter, a daycare, or a preschool, can be difficult to find‚Äîand to afford. Drawing on the findings of a newly released poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, this Forum event brought together a panel of experts to discuss parents‚Äô priorities and perceptions about their children‚Äôs care and how they square up against expert assessments of child care quality. How do parents find and select child care, and how does that care impact the health and well-being of children and families? How can child care be made accessible, high-quality and affordable? How do we even measure quality in a meaningful and accountable way? Forum panelists discussed ways to equip parents with better information about child care, and policy changes that can help children thrive.
 
This event was presented October 18, 2016 in Collaboration with The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In the crowd, alone
And very second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

[Verse 2]
Like a rock, I float
All the sweat and conversations that
Seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

"If Kraken Was Real, We‚Äôd Face Huge Problems","Have you ever heard of Kraken, the giant squid? Its smaller, real-life cousins live in the ocean's dark depths that people haven‚Äôt yet fully explored. And it seems we'll know more about squids soon. The metabolism of these creatures is accelerating thanks to the increase in water temperature, and this causes population growth. Will they be dangerous to us?

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

Lyrics:
Hola
Me llaman Romeo
Es un placer conocerla
Qu√© bien te ves
Te adelanto, no me importa qui√©n sea √©l
D√≠game usted
Si ha hecho algo travieso alguna vez
Una aventura es m√°s divertida
Si huele a peligro
Si te invito a una copa y me acerco a tu boca
Si te robo un besito, a ver, ¬øte enojas conmigo?
¬øQu√© dir√≠as si esta noche te seduzco en mi coche?
Que se empa√±en los vidrios y la regla es que goces
Si te falto el respeto y luego culpo al alcohol
Si levanto tu falda, ¬øme dar√≠as el derecho
A medir tu sensatez?
Poner en juego tu cuerpo
Si te parece prudente
Esta propuesta indecente
A ver, a ver
Perm√≠teme apreciar tu desnudez (take it off)
Rel√°jate
Que este Martini calmar√° tu timidez (don't be shy)
Y una aventura es m√°s divertida
Si huele a peligro
Si te invito a una copa y me acerco a tu boca
Si te robo un besito, a ver, ¬øte enojas conmigo?
¬øQu√© dir√≠as si esta noche te seduzco en mi coche?
Que se empa√±en los vidrios y la regla es que goces
Si te falto el respeto y luego culpo al alcohol
Si levanto tu falda, ¬øme dar√≠as el derecho
A medir tu sensatez?
Poner en juego tu cuerpo
Si te parece prudente
Esta propuesta indecente
I'm back
It feels good to be king
Gostoso
Hey
Listen
I know what you like
How 'bout if you and I, me and you
¬øBailamos bachata?
Y luego you and I, me and you
¬øTerminamo' en la cama? (Que rico)
How 'bout if you and I, me and you
¬øBailamos bachata? (Ay bailamos bachata)
Y luego you and I, me and you
¬øTerminamo' en la cama? (Terminamos en la cama)
How bout if you and I (You and I)

You and I (You and I)

Lyrics:
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there‚Äôs
Still a chance for you
‚ÄòCause there‚Äôs a spark in you

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‚ÄòCause baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on show them what you‚Äôre worth
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
You‚Äôre gonna leave before they know

You don‚Äôt have to feel
Like a waste of space
You‚Äôre original
Cannot be replaced
If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow
Maybe the reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect ‚Ä¶
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it‚Äôs time you know

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‚ÄòCause baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on show them what you‚Äôre worth
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
You‚Äôre gonna leave before they know

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It‚Äôs always been inside of you, you, you
And now it‚Äôs time to let it through

‚ÄòCause baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on show them what you‚Äôre worth
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you‚Äôre a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh‚Äù
You‚Äôre gonna leave before they know

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Nebu Kiniza - All In (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Nebu Kiniza - All In - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

Nebu Kiniza put the pedal to the metal with his 2016 breakout hit, ‚ÄúGassed Up,‚Äù and the atmospheric track made a sizable dent, powering its way past 150 million streams on Spotify. The Queens-reared, Atlanta-residing rapper has been on the grind for years, with a number of notable mixtapes under his belt, including ‚ÄòThe Honor Roller.‚Äô Along the way he‚Äôs also nabbed collabs with Lil Yachty and opened up tour dates for Big Baby D.R.A.M. This year, however, saw him release his proper debut, ‚ÄòFrom Me 2 U‚Äô - a refined take on his earlier work. Complete with billowy choruses and pensive rhymes, Nebu Kiniza is finally announcing his arrival. Get familiar with his DSCVR ATW performances, ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù and ‚ÄúPressure.‚Äù

LYRICS: 
I know You have good plans for me 
Plans to prosper plans to succeed 
You know the thoughts You think towards me 
And I‚Äôm so grateful You love me 

I know that when You look at me 
You see Your child You see my need 
I know that You will never leave 
I trust You Father I believe 

Your promises are yes and amen 
And I believe 
You will do what You say 
My trust in You will not waiver 
My victory is guaranteed ‚Äòcuz You remain the same 

No matter what comes my way 
Hallelujah anyhow 
Until my night turns to day 
Hallelujah anyhow 

We‚Äôre fighting in this deadly war 
Satan tries to conquer our soul 
Through pain through fear through stress through storms The battle rages on and on 

We know that All things work together 
Jehovah 
You make all things better 

Hit keeps coming after hit 
Got me thinking maybe this is it 
Got this war going on in my mind 
Tryna make me think my faith is counterfeit 
Whoah, No 
Certain days it feel like my faith is running low 
But it‚Äôs a mustard seed 
So I must believe in what I sow 
Sow in tears 
What you water will grow 
Never fear it‚Äôs all under control 
The storm is here 
But I‚Äôm sleep on the boat 
Woo, Yes 
Everything I went through I knew I would be blessed
Tryna pull me down 
But I see the mark so I press 
Christ brought me out so many times why stress 
I‚Äôma sing Hallelujah Anyhow through the test 

Hallelujah 
Anyhow 
Hallelujah 
Anyhow",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHbSj4po2U4

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

"Two years after Roe v Wade was overturned, safe abortion care is essential health care","When abortion is illegal and restricted, all aspects of sexual, reproductive, and maternal health are affected. Today marks two years since the US Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which overturned the historic Roe v. Wade ruling and the recognition of safe abortion care as a constitutional right. We‚Äôve witnessed firsthand how restricting access to abortion harms the health and wellbeing of the people who need it. 

Transcript:
Safe abortion care is essential health care. It's been two years since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. Let's talk about it. 

MSF doesn't currently work in the US, but we do provide safe abortion care and treatment for complications from unsafe abortion around the world. Country to country, the restrictions and the challenges are different.

But as a physician who has worked in many countries, I recognize the similarities. No matter where they live, people who are denied access to safe abortion care are at greater risk for complications than those who can access safe care. That can be because they are forced to carry an unintended pregnancy to term with its ensuing complications, or because they are forced to access unsafe means for abortion.

Another similarity are the economic and psychosocial ramifications of carrying an unintended pregnancy. That's why safe abortion care is an essential part of comprehensive health care. 

A few years ago, I was on assignment with MSF. In a country where abortion is restricted. One night, a woman came in heavily bleeding with a life-threatening complication of pregnancy. She needed us to provide safe abortion care to save her life.

The staff gathered quickly to decide how we would care for her. Not everyone agreed about abortion, but despite our differing convictions and values, we all were united by a single truth that we were there to help reduce her suffering. And that's what we agreed to do. The patient went on to receive high-quality and safe care within our MSF facility.

She was able to survive and she and her family were so grateful. At MSF, we see firsthand that restricting abortion only harms the health and well-being of the people who need it. Anyone who seeks an abortion, no matter their reason, is deserving of high-quality and dignified care.

Belarus sprinter given Polish humanitarian visa - BBC News,"A sprinter from Belarus who refused her team's order to fly home early from the Olympics has been granted a humanitarian visa by Poland.

Krystina Timanovskaya, 24, is at the Polish embassy in Tokyo after spending the night secured in a hotel under protection from Japanese police.

She said she was forcibly taken to the airport for criticising coaches, and voiced fears for her safety.

Belarus says she was removed from the team because of her emotional state.

Ms Timanovskaya told the BBC on Monday that she was safe, but said she had been advised not to give further details at this stage.

Wet Leg - Wet Dream (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022,"Wet Leg - Wet Dream. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll is at its best when it‚Äôs having a little fun. UK duo Wet Leg epitomizes that all the way down to their smirk-inducing name. Shallow as their discography may be (the band has only released two songs so far), there‚Äôs a big buzz surrounding Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers‚Äô two-year-old project formed in the Isle of Wight, the island off the south of England that they call home. Funny turns of phrase and pop-culture references abound in ‚ÄúChaise Lounge‚Äù (‚Äúmummy, daddy look at me / I went to school and I got a degree‚Äù) and ‚ÄúWet Dream,‚Äù in which a muse is seduced by the prospects of watching a Vincent Gallo flick on DVD. With its thrumming bass line, jagged guitar refrain, and lurid laughs, ‚ÄúChaise Lounge,‚Äù was a debut single so hot that it helped the IDLES disciples earn a deal with Domino Records, home of Arctic Monkeys and Blood Orange. Hilariously on brand, Wet Leg‚Äôs formation took place on a ferris wheel. ‚ÄúWe agreed on the premise of our band there and then: as long as you‚Äôre having fun, then everything will be alright,‚Äù says Teasdale, who handles the majority of the singing. It should be said that these guys are cool as hell, too. To receive DMs from Paramore‚Äôs Hayley Williams, you‚Äôd have to be.  Check their DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022 performances. When Chambers starts ripping the lead riff on ‚ÄúChaise Lounge‚Äù while at the same time doubling Teasdale‚Äôs vocals, you can see where the hype is coming from. The great thing about being a Wet Leg fan right now is it‚Äôs easy to learn all their lyrics. The hard thing is waiting for the next bop to arrive.

US-Mexico border: Migrants held as Trump threatens closure - BBC News,"United States officials say they're seeing an ""unprecedented"" surge in Central American asylum seekers arriving at the US-Mexico border.

In El Paso, Texas, US Customs and Border Protection is holding some migrants under a bridge due to what they say is a lack of space in processing facilities.

President Donald Trump has threatened to close the US border if Mexico does not do more to stop migrants reaching the United States.

Lyrics

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Emergency testing for South Africa variant widened as fears  grow over vaccine resistance - BBC News,"Emergency testing in parts of England for the new South African variant of the coronavirus is being stepped up after more cases were identified in Worcestershire, Bristol and South Gloucestershire. 

Urgent door-to-door mobile testing began recently after a number of cases were identified with no apparent connection to travel to South Africa.

A new trial is said to show that the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine is not effective against mild to moderate cases of the South African variant.  The findings from a small study have not yet been confirmed.

US lawmakers reject Trump-backed bill | BBC News,"The US House of Representatives has voted against a Donald Trump-backed funding measure, bringing a government shutdown a step closer.
 
A revised spending plan failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed in the lower chamber of Congress, with 38 Republicans voting against the bill on Thursday night, defying the president-elect.
 
After the bill failed by 174 votes to 235, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would come up with another solution before government funding lapses at midnight on Friday.
 
The Trump-approved replacement bill would have tied government funding to a two-year suspension of the federal debt limit, which determines how much the government can borrow to pay its bills.
 
Unlike in much of the rest of the world, government shutdowns in the US happen relatively often due to a 1980 act which basically ruled that without a budget there can be no spending.

Lyrics:
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Skinhead, deadhead
Everybody gone bad
Situation aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suite on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang-bang, shock dead
Everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody, do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I'm a victim of police brutality, now (Mhhm)
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
Your rapin' me of my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy
Set me free
Skinhead, deadhead
Everybody, gone bad
Trepidation speculation
Everybody, allegation
In the suite on the news
Everybody, dog food
Black man, black mail
Throw the brother in jail
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But it Roosevelt was livin', he wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skinhead, deadhead
Everybody, gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Some things in life they just don't wanna see (Ah)
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skinhead, deadhead (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation (Woo-hoo)
Everybody, allegation
In the suite on the news
Everybody dog food (Woo-ho)
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong or right me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Decision in TikTok appeal against US law which could ban app is due | BBC News,"The fate of TikTok in North America could be decided on Friday.
 
A federal appeals court is set to say whether or not they uphold an appeal by TikTok over a US law, which demands the social media app is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.

The lawmakers fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users.

But TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government.
 
A social media expert explains what we can expect.

Lyrics:

Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams...don't wake me up. 

Too much light in this window,don't wake me up
Only coffee no sugar, inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming, about your lips

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up [x3]
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me..

Don't wake me up [x3]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me..""",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOowQeKyNkQ

Porque siempre estuve equivocada
Y no lo quise ver
Porque yo por ti la vida daba
Porque todo lo que empieza acaba
Porque nunca tuve mas razones
para estar sin el
Porque cuesta tomar deciciones
Porque se que va doler
Y hoy pude entender
que a esta mujer
Siempre la hiciste imensamente triste""",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPeNUfc8hGk

The God Who Stays
I would‚Äôve given up on me by now
I would‚Äôve labeled me a lost cause Cause I feel just like a lost cause
If I were you
I would‚Äôve turned around and walked away I would‚Äôve labeled me beyond repair
Cause I feel like I‚Äôm beyond repair
But somehow you don‚Äôt see me like I do Somehow you‚Äôre still here

You‚Äôre the God who stays
You‚Äôre the God who stays
You‚Äôre the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You‚Äôre the God who stands
With wide open arms
And you tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays

I used to hide
Every time I thought I let you down
I always thought I had to earn my way but I‚Äôm learning you don‚Äôt work that way
Somehow you don‚Äôt see me like I do Somehow you‚Äôre still here
My shame can‚Äôt separate My guilt can‚Äôt separate My past can‚Äôt separate I‚Äôm yours forever
My sin can‚Äôt separate
My scars can‚Äôt separate My failures can‚Äôt separate I‚Äôm yours forever
No enemy can separate
No power of hell can take away Your love for me will never change I‚Äôm yours forever

Wife of jailed Briton Matthew Hedges speaks to BBC - BBC News,"Daniela Tejada has spoken to the BBC after her husband, Durham University student Matthew Hedges, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for spying.

The wife of a British student jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom.

Daniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University's Matthew Hedges sentenced to life.

The 31-year-old denies spying but prosecutors said he had confessed.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for ""a very frank conversation"".

Theresa May said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation adding that it was ""being raised at the highest level"" in the UAE.

Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May.",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQD4lwe7jyA

 ‚ù§   WE  Will Really Appreciate Your Feedback . 
                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

31 CHEATING HACKS || HOW TO CHEAT LIKE A PRO,"GENIUS CHEATINGS TRICKS ONLY SMART PEOPLE CAN THINK OF

In this video, I show you some cool crafts and hacks you can try to make your life easier. They are very easy to re-create and handy when you need them. 
You can use paper clips and some thick paper to make your own separators for your spiral notebook. 
If you want to copy some math equations or constants on but you don‚Äôt want to get caught. You can write them in a dark glossy notebook. Then when you tilt the notebook it will reflect the light and you‚Äôll see it clearly without it being visible to the teacher. 
Another great trick is to take a coke bottle with you in the exam room and write everything you need there. You simply drink have of it, flip it upside down and write on the bottle. Every time you need an answer, you‚Äôll only need to tilt it a bit a voila. 
You can use a paper clip to make your own phone stand to watch some 5-minute craft videos. 
If you got a bad mark on your test, you can correct it with some masking tape. Stick it on top of the mark and trace it with a pencil. The pen will lift right off and you can add your mark instead.

The World's Biggest Skyscrapers (Some Will Even Reach Space!),"Dubai is literally climbing to new heights - the largest and most populous town in the Emirates has Burj Khalifa which is the tallest building in the world. If you laid all its pieces end to end, they‚Äôd get a quarter the way around the world. It‚Äôs 3 times the height of the Eiffel Tower. The current tallest building in the world, but it could be dethroned soon! And now Dubai decided to break their own record, building an observation tower.

It‚Äôll be so tall that if you could lay it on its side, it‚Äôd take you 36 minutes to walk its height! Elevators (even super-fast ones) won‚Äôt be enough ‚Äì a vertical bullet train will take their place! It‚Äôll be made up of 6 outer buildings connected to and twisting around a central core. Let's look at it and some other cool skyscrapers. So, the world‚Äôs tallest buildings: past, present, and possibly future.

Contraception: An Essential Part of Women's Health Care,"As part of our goal to reduce maternal mortality and suffering, Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) offers a range of contraception options to women at our projects all over the world. ""Women need to be able to choose a method that suits them, that fits their particular circumstances,"" explains MSF midwife Liza Ramlow, ""what kind of access to care they have, whether or not they want something that others will be able to detect they're using."" Here, Ramlow describes her experience working at MSF's project in Central African Republic, where she says she saw a huge demand for contraception. Providing contraception helps prevent death and injury because it reduces the overall number of pregnancies, which can be dangerous for women with little access to health care, and it prevents unsafe abortions, another main cause of maternal mortality.

Lyrics:
Keep your faith to the sky (keep your faith)
Tell them keep
Keep your head to the sky (keep your faith)
Tell them keep

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to
Hey now

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to

Holy Father, keep my head above the water
I've been drowning in disorder
I need you to slow the slaughter
Am I trusting while I'm climbing? Kinda sorta
But you got good news for me, send me more reporters
Keep, gotta keep, keep
When my head is down, I can't see
Forward vision pixelated when I need it HD
Sailing, navigate me to the Prince‚Äôs port like Haiti
I believe these rocky seas one day give way to safety
Save me from wandering through deserts
I've been grumbling and angry, can't breathe
I got way more on my plate than I can take, it's eating me up
And I know you got new mercies for me daily, gotta re-up
And it's time to tell the enemy to stand down
When they ask who got it, put my hand down
Tell me what I need with worry when my help comes in a hurry?
Why be scared of them when you can make them scurry?
I wake up early, just to

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to
Hey, now

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to

If I‚Äôm honest, bro can I be honest?
I‚Äôd go supersonic, if they promise
All the peace, I'm trying to grab that I could find it
I‚Äôd go brolic like I‚Äôm Bron or Giannis
Can't nobody block it, I've been climbing
In this current climate, trying to find a rocket
Bank deposits, mixing gin and tonic
Filling up my pocket, if they got it
I promise I tried it, that's why I can knock it
Hit the mall or the supermarket
Asking, do they stock it?
I just need a piece of power, where‚Äôs the socket?
As of late
I just long for a sabbath day
Feel like I'm stuck in Saturday
It‚Äôs dark in my tomb, want a rebirth¬†
Can't wait till I march out the womb
Why would I keep searching for what he already gave me?
Crying out when He already saved me?
Lately, I've been telling me
‚ÄúWhy pick bondage when you free?‚Äù
I ain't saying ‚Äúc'est la vie‚Äù
He got everything I need
What a relief just to

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to
Hey, now

Standby
He can lift your burdens with your hands tied
Step outside, close your eyes, let him shade you
I feel alive when I hide, ‚Äòcause I'm made to
He go oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what the shade feel like
He go oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what it sound like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what the shade feel like
He go oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what it sound like

A House for $1 That No One Wants to Buy,"Some people dream of having a small, cozy house, and others dream of living in a huge mansion near the sea. Actually, it‚Äôs not that hard to make this dream come true because some houses are sold for just $1. But, as you can imagine, there‚Äôs a catch. They‚Äôre either impossible to renovate, in bad neighborhoods‚Ä¶or even worse. Would you fork up some pocket change for these homes?

TIMESTAMPS:

Such a gorgeous house! (ghosts included) 0:45

How about this historic Tudor-style home? 2:11

And this one costs just 10 dollars! 3:22

Have you always wanted to move to the UK? Check out this one 4:52

Incredibly cheap homes in Italy 6:20

If you're going to San Francisco, be sure... to buy a $1 house 8:02


Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:

- Victorian Mansion, $329,000

If you move into this home, you‚Äôll never have any alone time again. No, seriously. According to different ghost shows and past owners, this mansion comes with a beautiful staircase, a charming kitchen‚Ä¶and ghosts!

- Detroit House, $1,000

Sure, it has the charm of an early 20th-century home. But it needs new electrical wiring, plumbing, and even new wood floors ‚Äî and those are just a few of the things on the list.

- New Jersey Mansion, $10

One of the conditions of buying this New Jersey mansion is that you‚Äôll be solely responsible for moving it off the property it currently sits on!

- Houses in the UK for 1 Euro

While the price of these homes is just 1 euro, buyers are expected to take out a low-interest loan of $35,000 to restore one. 

- Homes in Ollolai, Italy, $1

The city is proud of its history and traditions and wants to do what it can to keep the town from disappearing from existence. 

- A home in San Francisco, $1

Someone has to not only buy the home but move its 2 halves from the city‚Äôs property to their own plot of land. Sounds like a lot of work, even for 1 dollar.

The Script - Man On A Wire (Lyrics)

Who'd a thought that
I'd be here by myself?
Who'd a thought that 
you'd be bad for my health?
Now I know, now I know 
I'm just a man on a wire.

Who'd a thought 
about the cause and effect? 
Yesterday‚Äôs love is now 
tomorrow's regret. 
Now I know, now I know 
I'm just a man on a wire. 

No I can't look down, 
I'm tryna fight the feeling 
I will fall to the ground 
if I ever see you, cos


I feel like 
I'm walking a tightrope, 
my heart is in my throat, 
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you.

And I've got my eyes closed, 
as long as the wind blows,
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you, you,

cos I'm a man on a wire, on a wire,
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire.

Who'd a thought 
I'd see you with someone else? 
Who'd a thought 
that I'd be in such a mess? 
Now you know, now you know 
I'm just a man on a wire.

But I'll walk that line 
I‚Äôll try and keep my senses 
make it to the other side 
I know the consequences, and

I feel like 
I'm walking a tightrope, 
my heart is in my throat, 
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you.

And I've got my eyes closed, 
as long as the wind blows,
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you, you,

cos I'm a man on a wire, on a wire,
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire, 
cos I'm a man on a wire, on a wire,
cos I'm a man on a wire, on a wire.  

The higher it gets, 
the more I miss the ground. 
No safety nets,
now you‚Äôre not around.
I have to keep walking 
to keep me from falling down.

Feels like 
I'm walking a tightrope, 
my heart is in my throat, 
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you.

And I've got my eyes closed, 
as long as the wind blows,
I'm counting on high hopes 
to get me over you, you,

cos I'm a man on a wire, on a wire, 
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire, on a wire,
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire,
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire.

President Biden tells America ‚Äúdemocracy has prevailed‚Äù - BBC News,"Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th President of the United States in a ceremony on Capitol Hill in Washington DC - the very place stormed by supporters of Donald Trump two week before. 

The new president declared that democracy had prevailed as he pledged to defend the constitution, while urging Americans to overcome their differences in the search for unity.

At Mr Biden's side was his vice-president Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black American, and first person of South Asian descent to hold the nation‚Äôs second highest office.

Conspicuous by his absence was the outgoing president Donald Trump, who had flown to Florida earlier in the day, while promising his fans to be ‚Äúback in some form‚Äù.

Mr Biden has promised that tackling the coronavirus pandemic will be top of his agenda.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award¬Æ-winning director Pete Docter (‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.,‚Äù ‚ÄúUp‚Äù) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs original movie ‚Äú Inside Out,‚Äù he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all‚Äîinside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions ‚Äì Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley‚Äôs mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVkDds11GNY

David Patterson is a Turing award winner and professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is known for pioneering contributions to RISC processor architecture used by 99% of new chips today and for co-creating RAID storage. The impact that these two lines of research and development have had on our world is immeasurable. He is also one of the great educators of computer science in the world. His book with John Hennessy ""Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"" is how I first learned about and was humbled by the inner workings of machines at the lowest level.

27 MOST INCREDIBLE LIFE HACKS YOU WON'T BELIEVE ARE REAL,"INCREDIBLE LIFE HACKS

Let's make an awesome smartphone projector! You're probably wondering - What will I watch on it?
- Anything you like! If you need some ideas, here‚Äôs a few of our suggestions:

Pull on your Pjs or a Onesie, snuggle up under your covers and project movies and catch up TV onto your bedroom wall. Proper cozy. Just careful you don‚Äôt get popcorn under the sheets.

Having trouble fitting all your mates around your smartphone? Project those funny fail videos and Vines onto the wall instead ‚Äì without anyone having to pull a muscle in their neck to join in. Boom!

Make up a slideshow of photos or cool visuals on your laptop, upload it onto your smartphone and create cool visuals at house parties. This also works well with still images ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôve got more than one Smartphone Projector.

Right, let‚Äôs get down to business. What‚Äôs inside the box? How do I put it all together?

Get your Blue Peter badge on, because this is where things get a little bit hands on. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì you won‚Äôt need to collect a week‚Äôs worth of toilet roll tubes or ice lolly sticks to build the Smartphone Projector, ‚Äôcause most of what you need is already inside the box. In fact, the only extras that you need are tube of superglue or double sided sticky tape and 15 minutes (yep, that‚Äôs it!) of your time.

Why were Hong Kong fans booing their anthem? BBC News,"The Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) has been fined $40,000 Hong Kong dollars ($5,160; ¬£3,400) by Fifa after its fans booed the Chinese national anthem during a match last month.
An object was also thrown onto the pitch during the World Cup qualifier against Qatar. Fifa, football's governing body, previously warned the HKFA over booing. The anthem has been shared by Hong Kong and mainland China since the former returned to Beijing's control in 1997.

I√±igo Quintero - Introducing I√±igo Quintero | Vevo DSCVR,"Introducing I√±igo Quintero | Vevo DSCVR

De la noche a la ma√±ana, √ç√±igo Quintero se ha convertido en una sensaci√≥n viral en Espa√±a. Natural de la ciudad costera de A Coru√±a, el cantautor creci√≥ tocando el piano, pero fue en el 2023 cuando la carrera del joven de 22 a√±os despeg√≥ de manera espectacular. Su primer √©xito ocurri√≥ en TikTok con la canci√≥n favorita de muchos ‚ÄúSi No Est√°s‚Äù, que apareci√≥ en cientos de miles de videos hechos por usuarios en la plataforma. La canci√≥n subi√≥ como la espuma en las listas de reproducci√≥n de Spotify y lleg√≥ hasta la posici√≥n n√∫mero uno en el Top 50 Global, sobrepasando estrellas como Bad Bunny, Myke Towers y Doja Cat. ‚ÄúMe gusta escribir letras sobre historias, sobre cosas que me pasan con las que la gente se pueda sentir identificada‚Äù, √ç√±igo nos cont√≥. Con sus letras francas sobre la espiritualidad, los desamores y las traves√≠as que pasan cuando intentas encontrarte a ti mismo, el joven gallego ha conquistado a p√∫blicos en Espa√±a y Am√©rica Latina. En su EP debut ‚ÄòES SOLO M√öSICA‚Äô  combina los elementos del piano cl√°sico con el pop para crear un sonido atmosf√©rico con armon√≠as melanc√≥licas y coros que llegan hasta el cielo. Durante su paso por la tarima de DSCVR en Londres, √ç√±igo film√≥ con Vevo dos presentaciones espectaculares: ‚ÄúEl Equilibrio‚Äù y su exitazo ‚ÄúSi No Est√°s‚Äù.

Seemingly overnight, √ç√±igo Quintero has turned into a viral sensation in Spain, Hailing from the coastal city of A Coru√±a, the singer-songwriter grew up playing piano, but it was in 2023 when the 22-year-old‚Äôs career as an artist launched spectacularly. First to pop was the TikTok favorite ‚ÄúSi No Est√°s,‚Äù appearing in hundreds of thousands of user generated videos on the platform. Success turned very real when the song broke into the Spotify charts and landed the first position in their Top 50 Global - ahead of heavy-hitters Bad Bunny, Myke Towers, and Doja Cat. ‚ÄúI like to write about stories, things that happen to me that others can identify with,‚Äù √ç√±igo told us. With his frank lyrics about spirituality, heartbreak and his journey into self discovery, the Galician has conquered audiences in his native country and across Latin America alike. On his debut EP ‚ÄòES SOLO M√öSICA,‚Äô he combines classical piano with pop to create an atmospheric sound with melancholic harmonies and choruses that soar to the high heavens. √ç√±igo came to Vevo‚Äôs DSCVR stage in London to film two electrifying live performances: ‚ÄúEl Equilibrio‚Äù and his viral hit ‚ÄúSi No Est√°s‚Äù.

"Donald Trump tweet incited Capitol attack, says inquiry - BBC News","A Trump tweet mobilised far-right extremists to converge on Washington DC on the day of last year's Capitol riot, a congressional inquiry has heard.

The then-president forged ahead with a rallying call to supporters even though aides repeatedly told him he had fairly lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.

The committee accuses Mr Trump of an attempted coup to remain in power.

Mr Trump has described the hearings as an attempt to distract Americans from the ""disaster"" of Democratic governance amid rampant inflation.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

6 Secret Tips to Always Win At Most Common Games,"Game night with your friends or family is always a blast no matter what you‚Äôre playing. In case you want to impress your friends and always win at most popular games you need to know success strategies that can guarantee your victory. With these simple but effective strategies, you‚Äôll win at rock, paper, scissors, scrabble, Monopoly, Jenga, dodgeball, and darts.

TIMESTAMPS
Rock, paper, scissors 0:43
Scrabble 1:43
Monopoly 3:22
Jenga 4:53
Dodgeball 6:18
Darts 7:34

SUMMARY
-Sticking with paper when you're up against a male opponent can help give you the upper hand. Most ladies tend to throw scissors on the first round, so choosing rock can increase your odds at winning when your challenger is a woman.
-Fill your vocabulary with more two- and three-letter words. Make the letter ‚Äús‚Äù your best friend. Also, be sure to analyze the board carefully before making your move.
-Don't be too picky at the beginning of the game. The sooner you start buying properties, the better. It's better to buy as many orange and red spaces as possible because they're the most landed-on.
-One of the most important things is having no strategy at all! Believe it or not, it's way better to concentrate all your energy on individual moves.
-Don't forget that you can always block incoming balls with your own ball. This trick comes in handy when you know you can‚Äôt possibly dodge the ball coming your way. When you're the last person left on the court representing your team, or there‚Äôs just a ton of attacks coming right at you, kneel down and hold your ball in front of you like a shield.
-If you wanna win, you actually need to find out exactly how bad you are. The easiest way to do that is to just throw three darts aiming at 20 and see where they end up. Then, simply measure the distance between each of them and the 20. And here‚Äôs where the math comes in. Once you‚Äôve got both measurements, calculate their average by adding them together and dividing the result by two. If you‚Äôre accurate within 5mm, you should aim for a treble 20. If your result is within 25mm of accuracy, it's better to aim for a treble 19. And finally, if you've found out that you're accurate only within 60mm, try to stick to a large spot around the center to the lower-left of the bullseye.

Lyrics:
This that Holy Spirit been takin' over
Trap music, no baking soda
Real pungent, you smell that odor
I'm still at it, yeah, hell froze over
I've been takin' down names like I'm at heaven's gate
When I gave her that ring, that was in God's plan
I can't separate

Ain't no devilment
Cannot let the devil in
How you barely sin but you out here selling it
You just settle in, trickin‚Äô for a settlement
Reject the reverent just to come relevant

How you out here broke, but you say you do the most?
Ridin' in that Phantom, but you still ain't met the Ghost?
Chasin' clout for gold, that ain't how we roll
Watch ‚Äòem hit the floor
If you know, you know
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

First spin, they in
Voil√° with my pen
Where I been? Top ten
How you feel? I'm him
Paid off sins, I'm good, roll out in,
I'm loved, represent my hood, what it do, I‚Äôm plugged

Ain't no devilment
Cannot let the devil in
How you barely sin but you out here selling it
You just settle in, trickin‚Äô for a settlement
Reject the reverent just to come relevant

How you out here broke, but you say you do the most?
Ridin' in that Phantom, but you still ain't met the Ghost?
Chasin' clout for gold, that ain't how we roll
Watch ‚Äòem hit the floor
If you know, you know
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

Ukraine: MSF Helps Provide Physiotherapy for People with War Wounds,"Months of conflict in Ukraine have left thousands of people in need of physical rehabilitation, including treatment of war wounds, surgery, assistive devices, physiotherapy, and more. Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) teams are helping provide these services at public hospitals in Kyiv and Vinnytsia.

We see that most of them are amputees, and they are presenting now with heavier handicaps than if they were treated properly with rehabilitation."" Read more at https://bit.ly/3RBXqil

Coronavirus: EU seeks 'gradual approach' to lifting of lockdown - BBC News,"The question of how all of this ends is of course the one we‚Äôre all been asking from the beginning. The severe lockdowns in place in much of Europe are not intended as long-term plans. Their justification was to stop escalating infection rates - and to buy time for governments. But still a pressure is building for this to end - and keenly felt in Europe.

A Personality Test Will Show If You a Narcissist,"Who is a narcissist? Legend tells of a guy called Narcissus in ancient Greece. He was extremely handsome and conquered many hearts. However, he treated his admirers with contempt. The gods decided to punish the arrogant man and made him fall in love with himself. Nowadays, a person is called a narcissist if he (or she) characterized by particular qualities. In this video, you'll learn what those qualities are. Also, you'll find out if you have some of them. 

TIMESTAMPS:
How can you recognize a narcissist among the people who surround you every day? 3:02
What makes narcissists what they are? 5:46
Is there no hope for recovery? 7:06
Are you a narcissist? (Test) 8:04

Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music 

SUMMARY:
- Any search engine will tell you that a narcissist is a person who is excessively interested in themselves. Such people are 100% sure that they are smarter, better looking, and more important than everyone else.
- A narcissist always tells stories about themselves. Very often, these stories are repeated over and over. Even if a narcissist fails to achieve something in their story, it's never their fault.
- Narcissists take extra care of their appearance. They are not necessarily more attractive than others, but they always make sure they look appealing.
- If you need to use flattery to deal with a person, you've probably encountered a narcissist. In this case, you have only 2 options: avoid them by all means, or keep flattering them to avoid conflict.  
- Narcissists can't stand criticism. As you know, most people don't like being criticized, but narcissists are hyper-sensitive to the opinions of others.
- Narcissistic individuals are selfish, and they never put anybody else's feelings above their own.
- One of the reasons for narcissism is concealed in a person‚Äôs DNA. Unfortunately, scientists don't have the slightest idea which gene is responsible for this trait of character.

French troops to withdraw from Mali after nine years - BBC News,"France and its allies in a European force will withdraw their troops from Mali, President Emmanuel Macron has announced.

The troops have been involved in the fight against Islamist militants in the country since 2013.

Mr Macron said the decision to leave followed a breakdown in diplomatic relations, amid growing hostility from Mali's governing military junta.
The forces will be re-deployed elsewhere in Africa's Sahel region.

The planned withdrawal, which is expected to happen over a four- to six-month period, was agreed at a meeting of European and African leaders at the √âlys√©e Palace on Wednesday night.

SUMMARY
-Sisu stands for resilience and courage, teaching you the art of giving up unnecessary words and excessive emotions. ‚ÄúIf something needs to be done, it will be done.‚Äù 
-In Sweden, lagom is a special skill necessary for living a balanced life. This concept of living can be translated as ‚Äújust enough, not too much or too little.‚Äù 
-The most well-known concept of happiness for Danish people is called arbejdsgl√¶de. To put it simply, it's the ability to enjoy what you do for a living.
-The philosophy of friluftsliv is all about spending time alone with nature in order to return to one‚Äôs true self. While spending time outdoors, your main task is to set yourself free from the general rush and routine.
-The Dutch believe that happiness is basically synonymous with unity with their loved ones. The word ‚Äúgezel‚Äù means companion or old friend. And ‚Äúgezellig‚Äù translates to cozy, pleasant, and friendly.
-Kalsarik√§nni can be translated as pantsdrunk and basically means spending time at home alone in your underwear enjoying a drink.
-The people in Iceland have their own unique word for happiness, and it's gluggave√∞ur! This Icelandic term defines that amazing feeling when you sit by the window with a hot cup of coffee or tea enjoying the weather from indoors but not wanting to go outside to appreciate it.

Lunay - Soltera (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"Lunay - Soltera - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting performers that are shaping the future of music.
 
Lunay isn‚Äôt lacking in the ambition department. When he was a teen, he earned himself tickets to a Daddy Yankee show in Puerto Rico by winning a contest where participants had to sing and rap in the reggaet√≥n king‚Äôs signature style. The kid had talent, that became obvious when he uploaded his first music tracks to Soundcloud and immediately made a dent around the island. When he had the chance to meet his hero at the concert, Lunay acted swifted and made the star a promise: someday they would work together. A couple years later, after getting his footing with ‚ÄúSi Te Vas Conmigo‚Äù and ‚ÄúDejame Saber,‚Äù he was shaking hands with Chris Jeday and Gaby Music, key writer/producers on Team Yankee, and his visibility, like his value, leveled up quick A 2018 creative flourish that found him virtually living in the recording studio resulted in dropping a parade of tracks under his own name (kicking off with the juggernaut of ‚ÄúA Solas‚Äù and its killer remix) and being featured on hits by some of reggaeton‚Äôs biggest names, including Zion y Lennox, Anuel AA, Bad Bunny, and yes, Daddy Yankee. Now, the kid who once entertained the members of his soccer team with his rhymes, and caught the fire of performance from watching the hand percussionists in his family‚Äôs church, is about to hit 2020 with lots of critical kudos and a widening audience in the wake of his album debut, ‚Äò√âpico.‚Äô The natural charisma he brought to his Artists To Watch performances is electric. Don‚Äôt miss ‚ÄúLa Cama‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoltera.‚Äù

Lyrics:
I couldn‚Äôt guess all the things going on in your head
All the reasons you had when you left
I don‚Äôt need to know
After a while, all the memories that I had left
Were the ones I don‚Äôt want to forget
Now I keep them close
 
So when you think of me, in the dead of night
Baby don‚Äôt you cry
Darling I pray for ya
Yeah I pray for ya
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
Always have grace for ya
I‚Äôll take the pain for ya 
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
 
There was a time
Where the words that you said really cut
Where I couldn‚Äôt help holding a grudge 
But I let it go
So I want you to find your peace
 
It‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs not me
Don‚Äôt need your apology for giving me hope
 
 Darling I pray for ya
Yeah I pray for ya
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
Always have grace for ya
I‚Äôll take the pain for ya 
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
 
 Yeah I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Said I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Said I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Said I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
 
When you think of me 
And you want to cry
Cause the things you did
Keep you up at night
When you think of me 
Baby don‚Äôt think twice
It‚Äôs all alright
 
Darling I pray for ya
Yeah I pray for ya
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
I‚Äôll always have grace for ya
I‚Äôll take the pain for ya 
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray
 
Yeah I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Said I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Said I‚Äôll pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
 
Wherever you go, I want you to know
That I pray

Turkey boosts troops to cross Syria border 'shortly' - BBC News,"Correction: The video incorrectly introduces Mr. Ibrahim Kalin as President Erdogan's special Advisor, Mr. Kalin is the Turkish Presidential Spokesman.
 

Turkey has boosted its forces on the Syrian border ahead of a long-threatened incursion that could target Kurdish-led forces allied to the US.

Troops would cross into Syria ""shortly"", a presidential aide said.

Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" cleared of a Kurdish militia that will also house some of Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees.

Donald Trump has withdrawn US troops in the area in a controversial decision widely condemned at home and abroad.

He again defended his move on Tuesday, saying the Kurds had not been abandoned, calling them ""special"".

The Kurds were key US allies in defeating the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria.

But Turkey regards the Kurdish militia that dominates the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as a terrorist group. The US pullout was seen as paving the way for an offensive

MSF Provides Urgently Needed Health Care for Women in Northwestern Syria,"After 11 years of war, northwestern Syria now hosts 2.7 million people, 80 percent of whom are women and children. With humanitarian needs growing, the region‚Äôs battered health system is facing dire challenges, including a lack of funding, making essential services like prenatal care and breastfeeding support increasingly difficult to access. ‚ÄúEvery time we go to the hospital, I find that the services are unavailable,‚Äù said Fatima, a displaced person living in Idlib governorate. ‚ÄúThey told me that the hospital where my daughter was born is now closed. It used to provide good services.‚Äù In response, Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) stepped up activities to fill the gaps, assisting 50 percent more deliveries in three hospitals in Idlib governorate in 2021 and responding to a 200 percent increase in Caesarean sections.

Chiiild - Sleepwalking (Live | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2022),"Chiiild - Sleepwalking. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Yonatan Ayal asks a lot of questions in the songs he makes as Chiiild. Like, ‚ÄúHow does it feel walking fast asleep?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúHow can I translate your words into light?‚Äù And, ‚ÄúWill you stay here for a while or have you had enough?‚Äù Sometimes existential, sometimes self-reflective, these queries always match Chiiild‚Äôs exploratory psych-R&B. Yoni‚Äôs called his reverb-drenched sound ‚Äúsynthetic soul,‚Äù and used the same phrase as the title of his 2020 debut EP. It dropped after the Quebec native had spent a few years in Los Angeles, where he wrote and produced projects for other artists. But as cool as a credit on a Chloe x Halle or a J Lo song was, Yoni couldn‚Äôt ignore an urge to create his own music. So with his longtime Montreal pal Pierre Luc-Rioux, he began focusing on all things Chiiild. The result was seven tracks of psych-R&B that struck a balance between familiar funk and hazy atmospheres. With its minimal slap-pop bass line and Space Echo elements, ‚ÄúPirouette‚Äù caught comparisons to Tame Impala and D‚ÄôAngelo. This past July‚Äôs ‚ÄòHope For Sale,‚Äô his first full album, expanded on the futuristic soul vibes hypothesized on its predecessor. Opportunities for live shows arrived this year, too. One Insta video documenting Chiiild‚Äôs first headline gig at NYC‚Äôs Mercury Lounge reveals Yoni balancing humility and ambition. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finally becoming the person that I always wanted to be. I just needed to express myself.‚Äù Indirectly, he references his LA past life. ‚ÄúI was expressing myself through other people, and the message got mixed.‚Äù Fans of Chiiild will love the way Yoni, Pierre and their band broke apart ‚ÄúWeightless‚Äù for DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022, rebuilding it with surprise breakdowns and a violin cameo. For ""Sleepwalking,"" he flew, ahem... soared, alone. Bet on yourself, and good things will happen.

Coronavirus: The situation in Europe - BBC News,"After Spain allowed work to resume at construction sites and factories on Monday, now Italy and Austria are allowing some retail businesses to restart, on a very limited scale. Food shops and pharmacies have remained open in the crisis.

More developments from Europe:

In Italy certain shops are reopening, after five weeks of lockdown: booksellers, stationery shops and sellers of baby clothes. Computer production and paper manufacturing are also allowed to restart. But the amount of activity depends on the region, and strict hygiene rules remain in force. Lombardy in the north ‚Äì the epicentre of Italy‚Äôs crisis ‚Äì is keeping shops shut. Italy‚Äôs death toll is now 20,465, the highest in Europe, but the infection rate has come down.
Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to follow Italy in imposing a strict lockdown. Now it is allowing garden centres, hardware and DIY stores and small shops to reopen. But people are still urged to stay at home and in shops the wearing of masks is mandatory. You can read more on this here.
There has been another record rise in Covid-19 infections in Russia, officials say: 2,774 more in the past 24 hours, making 21,102 infections in total, and 170 people have died. Thirty-four members of the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre have tested positive.
In Serbia police arrested a care home manager in the city of Nis, after 140 residents got infected. The manager allegedly allowed visits by relatives, and residents to leave the home, violating the lockdown. The charges could result in a 12-year jail term.

Record Covid deaths and cases with NHS under extreme pressure - BBC News,"The UK has recorded the highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day since the start of the pandemic ‚Äî 1,325 more people have lost their lives. 

A record number of new Covid cases was also recorded, more than 68,000 in a 24 hours period. 

Hospitals across the UK are under severe pressure, with some treating many more patients than during the first peak in April. 

London and the South East of England are currently facing the most pressure with one NHS leader saying the situation is ‚Äúoff the scale‚Äù. 

For some of the most sick, whose lungs have not been helped by a ventilator there is another alternative.   ECMO machines provide intensive life support, pumping oxygen into the patient‚Äôs blood so their lungs can rest and recover.   

Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by health editor Hugh Pym, medical editor Fergus Walsh and health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson ‚Äî from an ECMO unit at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge.

Springer spaniel helps stop rhino poachers in South Africa ‚Äì BBC News,"A dog trained in Wales has begun working in South Africa to stop poaching.

Indy, an English springer spaniel, was bred and trained at Dogs 4 Wildlife in Carmarthenshire to detect caches of bushmeat hidden by poachers.

So far, the organisation has sent 12 dogs to four African countries.

In March, Indy started her new job fighting rhino poachers in Mankwe Wildlife reserve, South Africa.

A total of 451 rhinos were poached in the country in 2021, according to the government of South Africa.

Most of the poaching feeds the illicit trade in bushmeat and rhino horn.

25 GENIUS HACKS FOR EASY LIFE || CLEVER TIPS AND TRICKS FOR ANY TROUBLE,"HOW TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS WITH UNUSUAL ITEMS
Running through annoying little problems is inevitable. But, in this video, I show you the smartest solution to all these issues. Starting with the following: 
If your sweater is too rough and itchy, you can fix it by soaking it in water and vinegar and then coating it with hair conditioner. That will help it become smoother. ‚Äì Finally, wash and dry it and voila. 
I also show you some great hacks using magnets. For example, you can stick a few magnets inside a syringe, collect little pins from the floor and then you can move them inside a secure container. You can also use magnets to make a glass bottle cleaner. You simply cut a kitchen sponge in half, place a magnet on each one and then clean your bottle with one sponge on the inside and the other one on the outside. 
Inside of having a plain colored hoodie, why not create your own one by cutting it diagonally from the middle and then sewing it with a different colored hoodie. 
I also show you how awesome uses for rubber bands. You can place them in your dishwasher to keep the glasses in place. You can also put them inside a frame to stop the pictures from sliding over or you can use them in your makeup routine as a makeup brush adjuster.

NASA Barge Crew Describes What It‚Äôs Like to Transport Moon Rocket,"Meet the crew of NASA‚Äôs Pegasus barge and learn how they transported the core stage for NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System rocket. The stage for NASA‚Äôs Moon rocket arrived at the agency‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida for Artemis I launch preparations on April 27. Pegasus ferried the huge, 212-foot-tall rocket stage from NASA‚Äôs Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where it underwent Green Run testing, to the Space Coast.  During its 900-mile journey, the rocket stage was in the hands of a skilled crew from Center Operations at NASA‚Äôs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The team carefully planned and orchestrated the core stage‚Äôs voyage on both a river and the ocean. To ensure the stage‚Äôs safe travels, the Pegasus team worked closely with NASA personnel as well as with Boeing, the lead contractor for the core stage, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, the RS-25 engines lead contractor. For decades, NASA has used barges to move large, heavy spaceflight hardware from testing and manufacturing sites to launch sites at Kennedy. Pegasus was specially modified to carry the deep space rocket hardware for NASA‚Äôs Artemis program, and the SLS core stage is the longest item ever shipped by any NASA barge. The Pegasus crew is responsible for safely transporting the hardware for NASA‚Äôs next-generation Moon missions.

There are currently believed to be more than 8,000 people on death row in the country. More than 200 have already been hanged in the last eight months. 
The hangman responsible for at least a quarter of the executions in Pakistan is Sabir Massih.  He spoke to the BBC's Pakistan correspondent Shaimaa Khalil and told her he came from generations of hangmen.

Street Food in Africa!! ü¶û LOBSTER MOUNTAIN + Huge Red Snapper in Madagascar!,"‚ñ∫ Watch Mark Wiens and Nat Geo #EpicFoodJourneys: https://youtu.be/MY3Qy6vAbZQ?si=Y2drp-DH9h_CbMRZ  

Good morning from Mangily, Madagascar, a fishing village on the Mozambique channel coast. This village is so beautiful, from the ocean, to the flora and fauna, to the local Malagasy street food and seafood. 

Today we‚Äôre first starting with a canoe ride in the ocean to see how they go fishing. Then we‚Äôll have an incredible Malagasy local breakfast of fish, beans, and rice on the streets of Mangily village. Then we‚Äôll see the local fresh seafood catch on the beach, but a huge red snapper and local lobsters, and then go back to a local home to have an ultimate Malagasy bbq.

The food and culture in the episode was truly breathtaking! Madagascar is a fascinating country; the people are so friendly, the nature is incredible, and the food is outstanding. 

Thank you to Michael Rakotomahefa for hosting us, and Coco, Andry (https://madagascar-discovery.com/), and Mario for taking me around on this ultimate Madagascar street food tour in Mangily!

Istanbul, T√ºrkiye - Welcome to Istanbul, one of the most fascinating, historical, and delicious cities in the world. Today I‚Äôll be taking you on an ultimate Turkish street food tour in Istanbul - you can expect some iconic street foods and some unseen surprises! 

Here are the places we ate in this tour: 

üìçGalata Simit√ßisi (https://maps.app.goo.gl/21CJNCCZZ4FMSB9YA) - You can‚Äôt come to Istanbul without trying simit, a common ring shaped bread that you‚Äôll find at bakeries and street food carts throughout the city. 

üìç√áiƒü K√∂fteci Seyfettin Usta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/u6i4Fj4LEpNRhZSJA) - One of my absolute favorite Turkish foods is √áiƒü K√∂fte, that includes raw meat, bulgur, and lots of spices.

üìçD√ºr√ºmc√º Raif Usta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/xkrWpGzZeSoByJQCA) - Turkey is the king of kebabs and a durum is a grilled kebab served wrapped in bread so it‚Äôs often fast and on the go. 

üìçTarihi EminoÃànuÃà Derya Balƒ±kcÃßƒ±sƒ± 1945 (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qq2h2opz347XSv3v8) - Probably the most iconic of all Turkish street foods in Istanbul is the balik ekmek, a grilled fish sandwich still served on a boat on the Golden Horn.

üìçBe≈üaltƒ± Kirvem Tantuni (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sbf1E4iCwXEg1wB97) - It‚Äôs hard to find anything tastier than tantuni! 

üìçTekrartekrarr Bay K√∂fte (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GkhSxeCbeQyJWP6z6) - This was something totally unique and that I‚Äôd never seen before, an ultimate cheese overdose, and so good!

üìçSokak pilavcƒ±sƒ± (https://maps.app.goo.gl/sKCn3GwgLJFa72q2A) - Another popular Istanbul street food is rice and chickpeas with shredded chicken, and you‚Äôll find it all over the city.

üìçMidyeci Erkan (https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfvrVjSiiwJdkAne8) - If you love mussels, midye dolma are a dream come true. They go down so easily and are so addictive!

Istanbul is a street food paradise, and I hope this video will give you some ideas for what to eat when you‚Äôre there!

Tiny Island Empty 20 Years Ago Is Now Most Crowded Place on Earth,"From a distance, Migingo Island looks like a desolate rocky chunk on Lake Victoria. But zoom in closer, a little more, and you‚Äôll see that grey color isn‚Äôt rocks ‚Äì it‚Äôs rooftops! 131 people live on this ¬Ω-acre piece of land. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much of a crowd ‚Äì after all, they‚Äôd all fit into one modestly sized movie theater auditorium! But the compactness more than doubles the most densely populated city in the world: Mumbai, India. 

Most of the island is covered with rocks. There‚Äôs barely any vegetation growing there, save for a tiny patch of green grass with a couple small trees growing on it. Locals make 3 times what they would on the mainland but most of the buildings are made from steel sheets. Let's find out more about one of the strangest places on Earth. By the way, it's not the smallest inhabited island in the world.

Lyrics:

Ay, Ay, Ay
Nobody likes being played
Beyonce, Beyonce
Shakira, Shakira (hey)

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about 'em that youwouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful Liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrOe2h9RtWI

Put a Piece of Chalk Under Your Door If You Wanna Stay Safe,"Here's a quirky little trick to keep in your back pocket ‚Äì ever heard of putting a piece of chalk under your door? Turns out, it's not just for drawing hopscotch on the sidewalk! Some folks believe that placing chalk under your door can help keep creepy crawlies like ants and spiders at bay. Plus, it's said to absorb negative energy and protect your home from bad vibes. It's like a DIY security system with a dash of superstition thrown in for good measure.

President Trump addressed Venezuelan Americans in southern Florida - BBC News,"US President Donald Trump gave a speech on Monday at Miami's Florida International University to a crowd of mostly Venezuelan and Cuban immigrants.

The area is home to tens of thousands of Venezuelan expatriates - many of whom fled Mr Maduro and his predecessor, and support for Mr Guaid√≥ there is strong.

During the speech, Mr Trump railed against the Venezuelan government which he described as a ""failed dictatorship"".

He described President Maduro himself as a ""Cuban puppet"" and accused a ""small handful at the top of Maduro's regime"" of stealing and hiding money.

""We know who they are and we know where they keep the billions of dollars they have stolen,"" he said.
He also implored the military to ensure the safety of Mr Guaid√≥ and opposition protesters.

Intro to 30-60-90 triangles | Right triangles and trigonometry | Geometry | Khan Academy,"A few more 45-45-90 examples and an introduction to 30-60-90 triangles.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Federal workers left confused as deadline expires to reply to Elon Musk email | BBC News,"US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.

Just 48 hours after an email asking ""what did you do last week?"" was sent, the office behind it clarified responses were voluntary, leaving agencies to decide their approach.

But as this new guidance was shared with federal agencies, President Donald Trump weighed in that workers who did not comply with Mr Musk's demand would be fired or ""sort of semi-fired"".

And later on Monday evening, Mr Musk reinforced the ultimatum, granting workers a final chance to respond.

18 AWESOME PRANKS AND GAMES FOR YOUR FRIENDS,"AWESOME PRANKS AND GAMES

My nephews love blowing bubbles and making your own solution is so easy with just a couple of kitchen ingredients. Making your own blowers from pipe cleaners or socks like this bubble snake is just as easy. We decided to put a twist on the bottle snake version by using a plain sock. The whole blower becomes a fun recycled project. Talk about turning trash to treasure! At least from a kid‚Äôs perspective.

Materials:

‚Äì Homemade bubbles (this is our favorite bubble solution using glycerin, water and dishwashing soap)

‚Äì Plastic bottle

‚Äì Scissors

‚Äì Lonely sock,  cut into a section wide enough to fit over your bottle

‚Äì Duct tape

1. Make your bubble solution according to the instructions here or get a variety of bubble solutions here.

2. Cut your bottle in half with scissors, add your sock over the half with the opening and secure the sides with duct tape.

Add some bubble solution in a shallow bowl so your bottle will fit over. Dip in the solution and then blow!

Remember to blow OUT and not in! If you want to prevent any accidental blowing in, you can simply ask your kids to blow without their lips actually touching the bottle opening. It works just as well. Check out our video up to see it in action!

The sock opening creates such pretty large bubble pockets. It‚Äôs magical to see them floating away. The kids had a blast making large multi-faceted bubbles!

Russia accused of using relatives of Ukrainian prisoners for sabotage | BBC News,"The wife of a Ukrainian prisoner of war explains how Russia attempted to recruit her for sabotage.
 
The 42-year-old had been waiting for news of her husband Dima, an army medic captured by Russia, for more than two years when she suddenly received a phone call.
 
The voice at the end of the phone told her that if she committed treason against Ukraine, Dima could be eligible for better treatment in prison, or even early release.
 
Later, the Security Service of Ukraine told Svitlana that the man she'd been talking to was indeed in Russia, and she should break off contact. 
 
In a statement to the BBC, the Security Service of Ukraine said co-operating with Russian agents ""will in no way ease the plight of the prisoner; on the contrary, it may significantly complicate their chances of being exchanged.""

31 SIMPLE IDEAS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER,"HOW TO MAKE LIFE EASIER

MacGyver isn‚Äôt the only one who knows how to use a paperclip. With a little ingenuity, you too can come up with genius hacks to make your day better. From getting your bra to fit just right to making a stand for your phone on the spot, your day just got a little easier thanks to these clever paper clip hacks.

Create a cheap phone stand for your desk out of a couple of paperclips. Clever idea!

Fasten a bracelet without help by hooking a paperclip through the clasp hole on the bracelet, using the other end of the paperclip to hold it steady.

Straighten up a messy collar using paper clips as collar stays.

Don‚Äôt pay for expensive bookmarks at the store. Make your own bookmarks by gluing a button or tying a pretty ribbon around the end of a paperclip.

Pull up a stuck zipper easy by looping a paperclip through the zipper.

Unclog glue or spray bottles by poking a paperclip end through the opening. Simple and effective!

Hold a floppy tie in place by clipping it to your shirt with a paperclip.

Bind a book or a bunch of papers together using a paperclip and some rubber bands. Great idea for keeping the kids‚Äô artwork together!

Turn your standard bra into a racerback bra by securing the straps in the back with a paperclip. You may want to put some tape around the ends to avoid being poked in the back throughout the day.

Pick a lock when you‚Äôve lost your key. This trick is best used with simple locks, such as those on luggage, diaries, lockers, etc.

Lyrics:

When the best of me is barely breathing  
When I‚Äôm not somebody I believe in  
Hold on to me  
When I miss the light the night has stolen  
When I‚Äôm slamming all the doors You‚Äôve opened  
Hold on to me, hold on to me  

Hold on to me when it‚Äôs too dark to see You  
Hold on to me when I have reached the end  
Hold on to me when I forget I need You  
When I let go, hold me again    

When I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm worth defending  
When I‚Äôm tired of all the pretending  
Hold on to me  
When I start to break in desperation  
Underneath the weight of expectations  
Hold on to me, hold on to me  

I could rest here in Your arms forever  
'Cause I know nobody could love me better  
So hold on to me, hold on to me

"He Found a Great White Shark in an Empty Building, See How It Got There","Imagine you're entering the territory of an amazing but abandoned Wildlife Park. The animal cages are overgrown with grass, small houses have been left for a long time, and cobwebs and mold are everywhere. You walk into a dark building and see a green glow ahead. You approach and realize it's a large water tank. There's old, green water in it, but you‚Äôre attracted by the silhouette of a huge fish inside.

You've just found a great white shark. Its body is in a formaldehyde solution, keeping it almost perfectly preserved. In 2012, Wildlife Wonderland in Australia ceased its operations. All the animals were moved from there, but the shark was forgotten. There‚Äôs a special story behind every deserted place in the world. Crumbling, rotting, or even completely overpowered by nature, these places can easily give you goosebumps. Here are the most interesting places that were abandoned for various reasons and circumstances.

Nasa makes history with closest-ever approach to Sun | BBC News,"A Nasa spacecraft has made history by surviving the closest-ever approach to the Sun.
 
The Parker Solar Probe passed just 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface on Christmas Eve - enduring temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could have frazzled its on-board electronics.
 
The probe moved faster than any human-made object by hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.
 
Scientists hope the mission will help us better our understanding of how the Sun works.

- At 7:20pm, we FINALLY have something familiar: sponges!
- It‚Äôs 7:55, and the Earth freezes over again. Time for a 2-minute ski sesh before everything melts.
- At around 8:30, we can remove our sun-protecting gear because now the Ozone layer appears. 
- By 8:45, life is flourishing in the sea. We now have jellyfish swimming around corals. 
- It‚Äôs 9:10pm, the moon is up, the sea creatures are getting a little stir-crazy, so they decide to explore the land. 
- By 9:45, we have the first 4-legged animals appearing in shallow waters. 
- By 10:30, everything vanishes, we can hardly see any animals. A mass extinction takes place. Only 5% of the species survive. I‚Äôm not sure what caused it. 
- 10:34, and the moment is here. The dinosaurs are finally making an appearance. The first one was the Nyasasaurus.
- 10:45 marks another mass extinction. Boy, it‚Äôs the second one in an hour. But thankfully, our dinosaur friends make it. 
- It‚Äôs 11:03, and we have the first kangaroo ancestors. These are the first animals that carry their babies in a pouch. 
- By 11:17, dinosaurs are reaching their full size. It‚Äôs like Jurassic Park around here! Look at the Argentinosaurus. This guy was the largest animal that ever existed.
- It‚Äôs 11:26. A giant asteroid coming right our way! It smashes into the Earth, and dust flies everywhere. A few seconds later, everything clears up, but the dinosaurs have disappeared.
- It‚Äôs 11:58pm, and still no signs of people. But the chimpanzees and bonobos appear suddenly!
- It‚Äôs 11:59 and 23 seconds, and we FINALLY have full-blown humans over in Africa! A second later, they start migrating all over the world.

1970 Oldsmobile Cruiser vs 2012 Ferrari FF - Generation Gap: Family Cruisers,"Cast your vote here: 
http://www.hagerty.com/Articles-Videos/Articles/2014/11/10/Gen-Gap-Family-Cruisers

In the final episode of season one of Generation Gap, Matt and Davin compare family cruisers. With its six-figure price tag and top speed of 208 mph, you¬πre unlikely to see Matt¬πs selection, a 2012 Ferrari FF, waiting to pick up the kids at school. Its part-time AWD system is powered by a direct-injection, 6.3-liter V-12 that blasts out 651 hp. Davin¬πs choice, a 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, may seem unassuming at first, but its Edelbrock/Lingenfelter Edition E-Force supercharged LS3 makes just as much horsepower as the Ferrari. It also comes equipped with Ridetech Air-Ride suspension and Wilwood disc brakes.

Generation Gap appears every other Tuesday on the Motor Trend youtube channel. http://www.youtube.com/motortrend

Coronavirus: Tokyo hospitals trying to stay ahead - BBC News,"Until recently, Japan had been one of the success stories in controlling the spread of Covid-19.

In February and March, Japan succeeded in suppressing early cluster outbreaks, and in keeping total infections in the hundreds.

But now the capital Tokyo appears to have a developing epidemic with more than 3,500 cases confirmed. Countrywide there are now more than 12,000 cases.

Doctors in Tokyo say a state of emergency, declared two weeks ago, is not slowing the spread of the virus enough to stop new cases overwhelming the hospital system.

Rupert Wingfield-Hayes and the BBC's Tokyo team have been inside one hospital just south of the capital, which has built a makeshift Covid-19 unit in just 10 days, to try to deal with the overflow.

Breaking News: Mpox UK on High alert #mpox #uknews,"Mpox: UK on High Alert #mpox #uk #2024 #breakingnews #uknews 

The UK is stepping up its response to the global mpox outbreak after the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency. While no cases of the more dangerous Clade 1 strain have been detected here, health officials are closely monitoring the situation.

Last year's outbreak primarily affected gay and bisexual men, but the new strain poses a higher risk. Authorities are urging vigilance, emphasizing good hygiene and safe sexual practices. Vaccines are available for at-risk groups, and plans are in place for rapid testing and isolation if cases emerge.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. We believe learners of all ages should have unlimited access to free educational content they can master at their own pace. We use intelligent software, deep data analytics and intuitive user interfaces to help students and teachers around the world. Our resources cover preschool through early college education, including math, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, finance, history, grammar and more. We offer free personalized SAT test prep in partnership with the test developer, the College Board.

Do Nothing - Happy Feet (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Do Nothing - Happy Feet (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

When Do Nothing‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄòSnake Sideways‚Äô arrives this summer, it‚Äôll be a moment of many culminations. Since 2018, the Nottingham quartet has been single by single building itself into a strong and distinct UK rock presence. Initial release ‚ÄúHandshake‚Äù harkened to a smart scallawaggery in the vein of Parquet Courts, Arctic Monkeys, and Blur. Next year‚Äôs ‚ÄúLebron James‚Äù found frontman Chris Bailey screaming about the value of having dinner with the NBA superstar over a few angular guitar riffs. Bailey counts LCD Frontman James Murphy as a main inspiration, and the band‚Äôs live show is so captivating that Interpol once tabbed them as openers. ‚ÄòSnake Sideways‚Äô - which comes June 30th to be precise - is the product of a much longer musical journey between Bailey and bandmates Kasper Sandstrom, Charlie Howarth and Andy Harrison, who have all known each since their early teens. At one point, Bailey confessed his trepidation about a debut album. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a head fuck for me, because I massively over-think things,‚Äù he once told an interviewer. But check these performances of ‚ÄúAmoeba‚Äù and ‚ÄúHappy Feet.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a band at the top of one of many apexes, with a confident grasp on their past and plenty to say in the future.

The history of the planet where I (and you, for that matter) come from started about 4.6 billion years ago. Before I came around, a lot of cool stuff had already happened. 

Oh, how interesting would it have been to see the first liquid water appearing on Earth 4.4 billion years ago. 3 billion years ago was when the first photosynthesizing bacteria appeared. The earliest land fungi that started growing 1.3 billion years ago are also worth mentioning. But I feel pretty bad for them when the land got completely covered with a thick layer of ice 850 to 630 million years ago! Glad I wasn‚Äôt around yet! So, guys, are you with me? It's gonna be fun!

SUMMARY:
- 485 million years ago, jawless fish appeared. They were the first animals with real bones—é
- 370 million years back in the past, some plants developed special tissue that started to produce wood. That's how forests of tall massive trees appeared on Earth.  
- While before this time sharks looked more like huge eels rather than deadly torpedo-shaped predators, they now have well-developed teeth and a whole variety of forms and shapes. 
- A real reptile as you know them today doesn't appear until 305 million years ago. At around that same time, other kinds of reptiles started showing up: the ancestors of modern-day crocodiles, snakes, turtles, and tuataras—é
- More and more different species, including new kinds of fish, are appearing in the oceans. That was about 251 million years back. 
- I remember seeing the first land dinosaur ever about 225 million years ago. It has a small head sitting on a long neck, and you have no idea how flexible this neck is! 
- About 201 million years ago, I witness one of the most ---biggest events ever, and that's the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction. It wipes out countless animal species both on land and in the oceans. 
- It's 155 million years ago, and I hear some annoying buzz. It's the first blood-sucking insect, also known as no-see-ums. 
- The mass extinction occurred 65 million years ago. It wiped out all the dinosaurs and half of other animal species.
- Also, a million years after the extinction, with the giant reptiles out of the way, mammals become the dominant species. 
- One day, approximately 60 to 55 million years ago, I see a bizarre creature. It has a long tail, climbs the nearby trees, uses its thumbs, and has a family! Later, I find out that it's the first primate. 
- 35 million years ago I have to start fighting for my home ‚Äì grasslands begin to expand and diversify, and I do my best to fend off the invaders. 
- Starting 25 million years ago, it‚Äôs as if this planet exploded with life! The first deer, hyenas, giraffes, bears ‚Äì my neighborhood got a lot noisier almost overnight! 
- About 4 million years back in the past, I see one of the first creatures that look a little bit like you, my friend. It's an Australopithecus, believed to be your close relative. 
- About 350,000 years ago, the first archaic humans called Neanderthals appear.

Dina - Easy Money (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Dina - Easy Money (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Our DSCVR program‚Äôs search for the next great talent is never restricted to one or two languages, or a handful of countries. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre putting you on to Dina, the modern French chanteuse who‚Äôs making stylish songs of romance and heartbreak. Growing up in Toulon, a picturesque beach town on the Mediterranean, Dina fell in love with Beyonc√©'s music. Such affection marks her catalogue, which boasts empowering if not cocky titles like ‚ÄúUnfollow,‚Äù and ‚ÄòBossy,‚Äô her debut album. Close listeners will hear a ‚Äúbad bitch‚Äù sneak in once in a while among her French verses, too. An ability to transition between vibes - R&B, hip-hop and pop, mostly - is a key move Dina has adopted from her hero. These DSCVR performances are all about that chameleon ability: her longing ‚ÄúDans Te Bras‚Äù starkly contrasts the dembow swag of ‚ÄúEasy Money,‚Äù and both are equally alluring. She just has that certain, how you say, ‚Äúje ne sais quoi.‚Äù

28 INSTAGRAM HACKS EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW,"MAKE YOUR PHOTO OR VIDEO GO VIRAL

If you like to amaze people I've got tons of great ideas how to impress everybody around you! And it's not that hard to do in the Instagram era. You just have to know some cool tricks!

One of my favorite tricks is when I stomp the floor severely and my friend pretends to be confused with these noises. Here's what you need to do. Find beautiful spot with a photogenic floor, then stomp your feet energetically. While your photographer is turning his smartphone on 360 degrees clockwise, your other friend takes your place and pretends to listen.

Another one is simply hilarious! But you'll have to find a car door. Once you find it, call your friends. One of them will help you to hold the door as if the car was slowly moving next to you. The other one is obviously gonna shoot a video. This insane hack is so worth trying!

So, go get your likes and new subscribers! ; )

What If Earth's Core Turned to Ice,"Imagine there‚Äôs a huge hot ball hidden inside the Earth. It's floating in an ocean of molten metal. This ball also spins on its axis, but it moves faster than the rest of our planet. This is what the Earth's core looks like. The solid metal ball is the inner core, and it‚Äôs 750 miles thick. The outer core is the molten ocean. To reach the edge of it, you would need to dig a tunnel into the Earth that was about 3,700 miles long. 

But you would hardly want to go there, because it‚Äôs the hottest point on the planet. The core temperature is 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Humans have learned to use the heat coming from inside the Earth as a source of energy. If the core ever cooled down and that heat disappeared, this kind of electricity might become very expensive. Phones, computers, the Internet ‚Äì all these things would cost a lot more. But this would actually be the least of our worries... So what would happen if the Earth's core went cold?

SUMMARY:
- Cricket could probably be compared to baseball, but there are quite a few differences. Two teams of eleven players each take turns to bat and bowl.
- The average cricketer salary varies in each country and this is causing some dispute. In Australia, for example, international male players would have started off with around 270,000 dollars per year in 2018. 
- England cricketers who started out in 2017 received a salary of about 265,000 dollars per year, with the middle tier players pocketing close to 600,000 dollars and the high rollers earning just under 1 million. 
- In India, the salaries of players are also divided into three tiers; Grade A, B, and C. Based on the value of each player, they sign individual contracts, with Grade A being the highest at approximately 150,000 dollars and Grade C earning 46,500. 
- There is quite a huge gap between all tiers when comparing the countries. And unfortunately, not all cricketers can play for one country. 
- Like many other sports, there are a few different competitions every year that don‚Äôt bind players by country, meaning they have the option of more than one contract that generates a salary.
- The current captain of the Indian Cricket team, Virat Kohli, was the only Indian, as well as the only cricket player, that was featured in the Forbes list of ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Highest Paid Athletes‚Äù and earned a mind-blowing 22 million dollars in 2017 alone.
- If you are thinking of seriously taking up cricket, you should probably know that they do, in fact, work very hard for those big bucks. 
- Men‚Äôs Health UK actually has a workout to ‚Äúget cricket fit‚Äù.

Another great doodle trick is to draw little mountains where one hides behind the other to make a huge 3D doodle painting. 
For those of your that prefer more geometric art pieces, I show you how to make perfectly squared patterns with a marker or Op-art inspired ones.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

10+ Sure Ways to Stop Hiccups in No Time,"There‚Äôs nothing more aggravating than getting repeatedly interrupted by yourself in the middle of a conversation. And those hiccups are hard to hide, and never seem to go away ‚Äì just super awkward and uncomfortable in any social situation! Is there anything we can do besides just wait for the hiccups to release their grip??

Hiccups start in your diaphragm. If it gets irritated, it‚Äôll spasm, causing you to unexpectedly suck in air. Luckily, there are some natural remedies you can use to kick those annoying hiccups to the curb, and some will even work in a pinch!

#hiccups #naturalremedies #brightside

SUMMARY:
-Guzzle down a cold glass of water as quickly as you can. The cold water will shock the system and ‚Äúdistract‚Äù it from the hiccups.
-Inhale deeply, and hold your breath for as long as you can.
-Get a teaspoon of white or brown sugar and hold it in your mouth for about five seconds.
-Swallow ¬Ω a teaspoon of white, malt, or apple cider vinegar. Wash it down with a glass of water.
-Put one teaspoon of peanut butter in your mouth and hold it there. After a few seconds, swallow it.   
-The sourness will make you want to swallow lemon juice hard and quickly, and this will interrupt and stop your hiccups.
-Chamomile will relax the diaphragm and stop the spasms that are causing your hiccups.
-This interrupts your normal breathing pattern, so it should interrupt your hiccups too.
-When you anticipate the next round of hiccups, cough or make yourself burp.
-As soon as you feel the need to swallow, do so, but make sure to keep your mouth open.
-When you get startled and jump, the release of adrenaline and your body tensing up both affect the diaphragm.
-Try to quickly swallow three times in between hiccups to restore diaphragm control. 
-Heat is a good way to relax any muscle, including the diaphragm.
-Essential oils should relax your diaphragm and restore your normal breathing pattern. 
-Warm milk has a calming effect as good as any essential oil.
-Standing on your head turns the diaphragm upside down, shocking it out of spasms.
-Sticking your tongue out as far as it will possibly go will work a nerve that‚Äôs connected to your diaphragm.
-If you‚Äôre doing something you enjoy, your diaphragm will relax and stop spasming.  
-The heat will certainly change up your breathing pattern, and your body will be busy doing some serious temperature control.

[Verse 1]
Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
Have people talkin'
Talkin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire

[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired

[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattle of Bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
You!
Your sex is on fire, ahh
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
And you!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's to transpire

How Much It Would Cost to Build Famous Landmarks Today,"Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì all incredible historical monuments and impressive engineering feats! But have you ever wondered how much it would cost to build these awe-inspiring landmarks nowadays? 

For example, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built around 4,000 years ago. The whole thing was made with more than 2 million limestone blocks, each weighing about 2.5 tons. And it took tens of thousands of workers up to 30 years to complete the construction! If you decided to build such a colossal monument nowadays, the total price tag would be a jaw-dropping $1.2 billion! But it isn‚Äôt even the most expensive!

#landmarks #wondersoftheworld #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Let‚Äôs say you just want to make yourself a Big Ben Bell. You‚Äôll need to get hold of $63,000 for copper, 67,000 for tin, 90,000 for the workers, and 3,000 for cranes and the whole installation process. In total, it‚Äôs $223,000. 
- To build Statue of Liberty nowadays, you‚Äôd need $780,000 for the materials (copper, steel, and concrete) and half a million for the construction work. Meaning the total cost of your Statue of Liberty project would be almost $1.3 million. 
- Stonehenge consists of two types of stones. So, that‚Äôll be $1 million for the sarsen stones (the smaller ones), 100,000 for bluestones (those are the big ones), another 100,000 for trenching, and 2.3 million for the labor and cranes. 
- If you decided to build your own Tower of Pisa, you‚Äôd need to spend almost $3 million on the white marble it‚Äôs made from. The cranes and labor would add 1.2 million to that. 
- To build an Eiffel Tower in your backyard, you‚Äôd need the permission of your neighbors (good luck with that!) plus $1.2-million-worth of materials like iron, rivets, paint, and light bulbs. 
- The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. If you wanted to create the same oasis for yourself, you‚Äôd have to spend 21.5 million on the materials and landscape designers. The workers will take their 10 million, and you can say goodbye to a total of $31.5 million.
- The Parthenon. These days, re-constructing the famous landmark would demand over $35 million!
- Machu Picchu. You would spend 57 million on the materials (mainly granite) and 13 million on the labor and cranes. A total of $70 million - and voila! You have a cool mountainous city!
- The Taj Mahal. To build one today, get ready to pay 3 million for the bricks, 23.5 million for the marble, 15 million for the garden, and 2.5 million for the dome! 
- Built from stone and concrete, Rome‚Äôs Colosseum is the world's largest amphitheater. You‚Äôll need $200 million‚Ä¶just for the limestone alone! The elliptical structure would be 215 million. 
- The construction of the original wall took over 2,000 years to complete! It would cost you around 21 billion to get all the necessary materials. You‚Äôll need the same amount to talk the builders into getting down to work.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

14 Differences of Homes Around the World,"What do typical homes from around the world look like? We often see different homes and interiors in the movies, so we have a general idea of what the dwellings of people in different corners of the world look like. But rarely do we realize that what we see on the screen can differ greatly from reality. Let's find out how people in different countries equip their dwellings.

Not long ago, I visited a friend in the UK. I stayed at his place, and everything seemed pretty similar to where I live. But then I went to the bathroom and‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúUm, Andy? Where‚Äôs the light switch?‚Äù He came in, pulled a cord I didn‚Äôt notice, and also showed me how to use the two taps in the sink. Later, he told me of many more homes in different countries he‚Äôd been to.

25 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR PHOTO OR VIDEO GO VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"MAKE YOUR PHOTO OR VIDEO GO VIRAL

If you like to amaze people I've got tons of great ideas how to impress everybody around you! And it's not that hard to do in the Instagram era. You just have to know some cool tricks!

One of my favorite tricks is when I stomp the floor severely and my friend pretends to be confused with these noises. Here's what you need to do. Find beautiful spot with a photogenic floor, then stomp your feet energetically. While your photographer is turning his smartphone on 360 degrees clockwise, your other friend takes your place and pretends to listen.

Another one is simply hilarious! But you'll have to find a car door. Once you find it, call your friends. One of them will help you to hold the door as if the car was slowly moving next to you. The other one is obviously gonna shoot a video. This insane hack is so worth trying!

So, go get your likes and new subscribers! ; )

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

China coronavirus deaths and cases spike - BBC News,"Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday - the deadliest day of the outbreak.

There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed with Covid-19.

Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people - which accounts for most of the rise in cases.

China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed.

Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising.

But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 - with almost 60,000 infections in total.

'I invented paintball to settle an argument' - BBC News,"One summer in the early 1980s, two friends - one a Wall Street banker, the other an outdoorsman from New Hampshire - argued about who could survive better in the wild.

To try and settle the matter, they got two agricultural paint guns, and shot at each other.

Little did they know what they had just created.

The children seeking cosmetic surgery on their vaginas - BBC News,"Doctors say they are seeing a rise in the number of young girls wanting cosmetic surgery on the most intimate part of their body ‚Äì their genitals. The country‚Äôs leading adolescent gynaecologists told the Victoria Derbyshire Programme that girls as young as nine are desperate for the surgery because they are so distressed about the appearance of their vaginas. The surgery is called labiaplasty. It‚Äôs where the lips of the vagina are shortened or reshaped. It‚Äôs not recommended for girls under the age of 18 as their bodies haven not fully developed, but there are concerns that some girls are being given the surgery unnecessarily on the NHS.

‚Äã‚ÄãIs it worth starting a blog this year? Does blogging still bring a good income?
  
If you are in doubt about blogging, I want to ask you one thing. How much do you lose if you try and start a blog? My business expenses as a blogger are very low. It‚Äôs a business with the highest ROI you can imagine. I do this while working from home, I am in control of my own schedule, which really helps because I have a toddler and I want to spend time with my daughter while she is small.
  
I this video, I will lay out a step-by-step plan for you to get your first $1000/mo with your blog! And if you want to get started with this plan today, join my free 7-day course to start your blog. Check the link in the description below and let's get started with the first step. Step #1 
First, you need to Understand HOW you will Make Money

When I started my blog, I did what most of the people do - I tried to apply to Google Adsense as soon as I could, to run some ads on my blog. That's what you were going to do, right?
Well, let me tell you why maybe you shouldn't. 
Yes, adding ads from Google Adsense or  Media.net is the easiest thing you can do with a new website to start making some money.
Usually, it‚Äôs enough to have about 20 posts on your blog and something that a lot of people don‚Äôt know about ‚Äì you need a Privacy Policy page before you apply!
But if you ask for my opinion, I don‚Äôt think you should even bother applying to Adsense when you have very low traffic because they pay very little for each 1000 of visitors. 
When your traffic is lower than 1000 visitors a month, you will be earning less than $10 with display ads. Yes, less than $10 per month. So it‚Äôs not worth sending your small audience away from the site for so little money.
What would I do first if I started my blog these days, knowing everything that I learned in 5 years?
Affiliate Marketing
My top recommendation for you is to find affiliate products that you can promote in your niche. 
You can work with large affiliate networks but don't bother joining Amazon Associates, this is like Google Adsense just from affiliate marketing - very low commission rates, very high risk of getting your account blocked for no reason with all the $2.5 that you will be lucky to earn in a year. 
Now if not Amazon Associates, which other large affiliate networks would I recommend you? Well, Impact, CJ Affiliates, ShareaSale, reWardStyle, ClickBank, Partnerstack to name a few. But which ones will work for you the best really depends on your nich e. ReWardStyle is best for fashion and",Science & Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKOQew8JlQo

What If There Was No Gravity for 1 Minute,"Remember that unsatisfactory feeling as a kid when you‚Äôd try to jump in the air as high as possible, and something brings you back to the ground? Well, that is Gravity. Like your mother, it's always there, it never changes, and you can‚Äôt break it‚Äôs rules. But that's for the better! If one day, the Earth's gravity disappeared, the consequences would be flat out disastrous.  

Gravity depends on the mass, which is, in turn, related to the matter. The more matter you have, the bigger the mass is. And the bigger the mass is, the stronger an object's gravitational pull is.   You might have noticed that the gravity on our planet never changes, right? That's because the mass of the Earth always remains the same. But what if we imagined that one day, our planet would give off a terrifying ‚Äúcrack‚Äù, and gravity would just disappear?

We would simply fly off into space 2:03

The Earth would break into pieces 4:01
What if gravity, on the contrary, became stronger? 4:32 üí™

#gravity #space #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Gravity is a force that draws atoms toward each other. Our planet is a big-big number of atoms, crammed together. That's why its gravitational pull is very real and very perceptible.
- The more matter you have, the bigger the mass is. And the bigger the mass is, the stronger an object's gravitational pull is.   
- Should huge chunks of the planet get ripped out from under your feet, the gravity would gradually change as well. 
- The most obvious outcome would be floating. I mean that you, the bed you've been sleeping on, your alarm clock, and your cup of unfinished tea would instantly rise into the air.
- If the gravity got switched off, anything unattached to the ground would simply fly off into space. People unlucky enough to be outside when the gravity disappears would be gone in the blink of an eye. 
- Those people inside buildings would be safer, but not for long. It's true that man-made structures are supposed to be firmly rooted to the ground. 
- Furthermore, the Earth would lose one of its best friends - the Moon. The only thing keeping the Moon from floating away and keeping our planet's natural satellite in orbit is the Earth's gravity. 
- Later, when life on Earth would cease to exist completely (what with no air and water), the lack of gravity would finally take its toll on the planet itself. 
- Without the main force holding things together, it would likely break into pieces and float off into space. 
- What if gravity, on the contrary, became stronger, and not only on the Earth, but everywhere in the Universe? Would it influence your life? 
- If the gravity changed even slightly, it‚Äôd completely disrupt the existing balance, and the Earth would move into a new orbit. As a result, our planet would start traveling about 10% closer to the Sun.
- Bridges wouldn't stand any chance; neither would large buildings, such as skyscrapers. Smaller houses might remain standing for some time, but they‚Äôd need to be reinforced. 
- Experiments in centrifuges show that people can easily tolerate two times the Earth's gravity for up to 22 hours with no harm to their health.
- Dormant volcanoes that‚Äôve been sleeping for thousands of years would wake up and start changing the surface of the planet. 
- If gravity became twice as strong as it is now, the Earth would spiral into the sun at a dizzying rate.

The Last Dinner Party - Nothing Matters (Live) | DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024,"Prelude To Ecstasy - our debut album will be yours on the 2nd February 2024 üçá https://tldp.lnk.to/preludetoecstasyID

The Last Dinner Party  - Nothing Matters (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2024

It‚Äôs always good to have a plan. When the members of The Last Dinner Party were just a group of pals with musical interests and not yet full-on bandmates, they made a point of plotting almost every aspect of their pending venture. The group name, visual approach, fashion choices, level of theatricality - each turn was discussed while the LDP dreamed up the future they wanted for themselves. This was back in 2020, when the pandemic‚Äôs down time gave them plenty of opportunity to scheme. Soon after, singer Abigail Morris, bassist Georgia Davies and guitarist Lizzie Mayland would spend night after night in London clubs, assessing the acts that resonated most with them and getting the lay of the land. By the time they connected with guitarist Emily Roberts and keyboardist Aurora Nishevci, a path was clear and music began to blossom. Pop may be about spontaneity, but it‚Äôs aided by planning and craft; the ladies have said they wanted to be ‚Äúfully formed‚Äù by the time they presented themselves. Last spring, after months of gigging, earning an audience, and being signed, they presented themselves to the world, and yep, ‚ÄúNothing Matters‚Äù felt like the complete package - a rather unique vision that brings a fun formality to an alt-rock attitude. By this past summer, it had inched up the charts and been critically heralded as a cool new breakthrough. The band quickly put the pubs in the rear-view mirror, and accepted opening slots for Florence + The Machine and Hozier. Now ‚ÄúNothing Matters‚Äù has been joined by ‚ÄúSinner‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Lady of Mercy,‚Äù further proof that The Last Dinner Party knows what it's doing. Check the well-organized way they rock through their Artists To Watch performances - everything in its place.

Ultimate Adventure 2023 Ep 2: West Virginia Style High RPM Rockcrawling | MotorTrend,"Sometimes you gotta pin it to win it. In addition to rigorous road miles, untamed terrain, and a never-say-quit spirit, Ultimate Adventure is also known for its camping days, with participants needing to pack and transport everything they need to live out of their vehicles. But for this episode at the Good Evening Ranch in Canvas, West Virginia, the group got to leave their camps set up and hit the trails without all the extra baggage and given the unbelievable snot-slick surface of this upper-lever offroad park, it‚Äôs a good thing they weren‚Äôt weighted down. You gotta see it to believe it.

Since 1999, Ultimate Adventure has been the world's best and longest-running off-road adventure trip of its kind. Participants meet in a different location each year with highly modified 4x4 vehicles equipped to tackle the toughest trails in the nation over a grueling 1,000-plus mile trek held over seven days. But as a double-whammy there are no trailers allowed, so in addition to insane off-road prowess, these crazy trucks, Jeeps, and 4x4s must be able to eat up the road miles as well as the obstacles. All this and the necessity to carry everything needed to live in the bush for a week on end. Nobody but Christian Hazel and Trent McGee know where they're going or what bucket-list locations they'll visit. It's the ultimate test of man and machine, team-building camaraderie, and human as well as mechanical endurance. It's the Ultimate Adventure!

How long range missiles striking inside Russia will change the Ukraine war | BBC News,"1,000 days into the war in Ukraine ‚Äì and just two months before his presidency ends - Joe Biden has given the green light for Ukraine to fire US-supplied long range missiles into Russian territory.
 
The US has forbid the use of ATACM ballistic missiles inside the country ‚Äì until now.   
 
The change in policy reportedly comes in response to the recent arrival of North Korean troops to support Russia in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has occupied territory since August.
 
In this week‚Äôs Security Brief, former senior British officer and assault helicopter pilot Mikey Kay explains how these weapons will be used, the support that may follow from Nato allies, and how Russia will respond.

Using reflection tool

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

"50 Years of Spacewalks on This Week @NASA ‚Äì June 5, 2015","On June 3, 1965, NASA astronaut Edward White became the first American to walk in space when he spent about 23 minutes outside the Gemini 4 spacecraft, maneuvering around with a hand-held oxygen-jet gun. That mission also was the first time the agency‚Äôs famed Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center was used. NASA‚Äôs celebration of the first U.S. spacewalk, also known as an extravehicular activity or EVA ‚Äì included a documentary narrated by actor Jon Cryer and featuring NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, Deputy Administrator Dava Newman and others. The film, titled Suit Up, focused on the five decade history of spacewalks and the future of humans working on a tether in space.

Syria: Last Access Route to the Northwest at Risk of Closure,"After 11 years of war, 4.1 million people remain in need of humanitarian aid in northwestern Syria. Bab Al-Hawa crossing on the Syria-Turkey border is the last remaining humanitarian crossing point into the region. Now, this lifeline is at risk of closure if the United Nations (UN) Security Council does not renew the cross-border resolution, which is set to expire on July 10.

Closing the Bab Al-Hawa crossing will reduce access to basic food, water, and health care for millions of people, putting lives at risk. Most hospitals and health facilities would lack the necessary medical supplies to function, leading to preventable deaths. In 2021, 99 percent of Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) medical supplies entered Syria through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing. MSF calls on the UN Security Council to renew the current cross-border resolution and keep Bab Al-Hawa crossing point open.

Why did this Nigerian couple get married three times? - BBC News,"Nigerian weddings are glitzy and glamorous but they can also be costly - especially when couples decide to have three different ceremonies.

Echina is from a Nigerian Igbo background and Leah's background is Antiguan and Jamaican. They wanted to honour both their cultures when they got married, so they had three wedding ceremonies in 12 months.

The BBC's Chinwe Kalu-Uma went to meet them.

Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Why Some Info Is Need to Know,"When someone says that information is on a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis, your mind might automatically think that the information is secretive, dangerous, etc. But, there‚Äôs another type of ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù information that involves different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of information. 

On this StarTalk explainer video, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are exploring these different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of information. We discuss why, in certain circumstances, an idea is better than the details. To understand these levels of information, we explore the Earth‚Äôs orbit around the Sun. You‚Äôll learn why you can say the Earth goes in a circle around the Sun and be ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù even though it‚Äôs actually an elliptical orbit. And you can say it‚Äôs an elliptical orbit even though it‚Äôs actually a loop-de-loop!

Find out how Earth‚Äôs tilt influences our seasons. You‚Äôll also find out about the ‚Äúlibration‚Äù of the Moon or as Chuck calls it ‚ÄúMoon twerking.‚Äù And, we discuss Earth‚Äôs precession around the Sun. Lastly, Neil uses the size of the Sun as another example of understanding different levels of information. All that, plus, we explore why the scientific method allows for the possibilities of change.

Health & Medicine on Khan Academy: No organ quite symbolizes love like the heart.

It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love. Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound ‚ÄúLub Dub.‚Äù

Oil hits new high and shares sink as Russia invades - BBC News,"Oil prices have surged past $100 (¬£74) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.

Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter.

The price of oil topped $105 a barrel, and UK motoring groups said petrol prices had hit another record high.

Coronavirus: Is there a link between the Severity of Covid-19 and Air pollution - BBC News,"A recent Harvard analysis is the first  study to show a statistical link between COVID-19 deaths and other diseases associated with long-term exposure to fine particulate matter. 
In an analysis of 3,080 counties in the United States, researchers at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that higher levels of the tiny, dangerous particles in air known as PM 2.5 were associated with higher death rates from the disease.

The paper goes on to suggest that just a slight increase in long-term pollution exposure could have serious coronavirus-related consequences, even accounting for other factors like smoking rates and population density.

EU stops short of coronavirus vaccine export ban - BBC News,"European Union leaders have stopped short of banning vaccine exports after a protracted row with the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca.

At a summit on Thursday they gave backing in principle for toughening export controls.

But a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of global supply chains needed to produce vaccinations.

Elements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AstraZeneca must ""catch up"" on deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere.

Former US President Donald Trump arch-enemy Liz Cheney ousted in Wyoming election ‚Äì BBC News,"Voters in the US state of Wyoming have ousted congresswoman Liz Cheney, a rare Republican critic of former President Donald Trump, in a primary election.

She has been trounced by a relative political newcomer and Trump-backed candidate, Harriet Hageman.

Ms Cheney, 56, was one of only two members of her party to join the congressional committee investigating Mr Trump's attempts to cling to power.

The three-term congresswoman was once a rising Republican star.

12 Strange Things You Only See in India,"India is undoubtedly one of the most interesting countries in the world. For outsiders, it‚Äôs a country of mystery, with an exotic culture and tradition of ancient wisdom we never encounter at home. It strikes us with its contrasts. It‚Äôs a place full of odd customs and curiosities. Bright Side gathered 12 amazing facts about this country of spices that will show India from a completely different side.

I bet you never thought that India is the birthplace of all plastic surgery! Yup, among India‚Äôs most sacred texts, there‚Äôs one that baffles surgeons and medical experts to this day. It was written by the ancient Indian surgeon Sushruta somewhere between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE. The text describes tons of unbelievably complex surgical procedures! Can you imagine that?

SUMMARY:
- India is one of the largest English-speaking countries in the world, second only to the US. But in a country with around 880 spoken languages, only 22 of which are even officially recognized, it‚Äôs no wonder Indian English may sometimes tickle your ear in a strange way.
- In India, when two loving hearts decide to marry each other, the groom must put a wedding ring on his bride‚Äôs‚Ä¶ toe? Yep, that‚Äôs the custom! These wedding rings are called ‚Äúbichiya,‚Äù and every bride wears them on both her second toes as a sign of her newly married state.
- Most people in India believe that a spoken word has immense power within it. And if you break a promise, you‚Äôll enrage spirits and deities.
- India‚Äôs Bollywood is the largest film industry in the world. It produces about 1,200 films every year ‚Äì that‚Äôs twice the amount that Hollywood puts out.  
- If you ever go to the village of Anandapally after harvest season, then you might be able to watch some bull surfing! Can you imagine riding on a board with the power of two oxen in your hands?!
- The original word ‚Äúchampu‚Äù means ‚Äúmassage‚Äù and was initially used to describe the process of hair strengthening with herbs common in India.
- India gets a lot of criticism for its pollution problem, which there‚Äôs no denying that it‚Äôs a serious one. But that doesn‚Äôt say anything about Indian people‚Äôs attitude towards wildlife. There are 104 national parks in India, with over 15,000 square miles of overall coverage.
- India is not only home to rare wildlife species, but some uncommon ideologies too. One of them is Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians believe fire and earth to be sacred fundamental elements, so it‚Äôs really undesirable for them to bury or cremate their departed.
- Indian has the fourth largest railway system in the world, with almost 42,000 miles of track overall. But if you want to keep a pleasant impression of this country in your heart, then you might wanna avoid trains at all costs.
- ‚ÄúThe Most Beautiful Indian Elephant‚Äù contest happens each year on the full moon between February and March, and this pageant is a key part of Jaipur‚Äôs famous Elephant Festival. Nowhere else in the whole world are these gorgeous giants celebrated like they are here.

Lauren Daigle - Don‚Äôt Believe Them (Live Performance) | Vevo,"Lauren Daigle - Don‚Äôt Believe Them (Live Performance)

""These streets may not look pretty/But I see angels walkin' in the city."" There's uplift in Lauren Daigle's music, because there's uplift in Lauren Daigle's spirit. What's inside her reaches out and connects to those listening, and increasingly, that group is a growth demographic. With four albums behind her, the singer-songwriter is in a rich artistic period. Her work has never sounded so worldly, convincing, and unfettered. Though she came up in the realm of contemporary Christian music, her themes and messages are universal enough to be digested and enjoyed by those of various beliefs. The New York Times recently reminded readers that the Louisiana native ""identifies as nondenominational."" Her recently released self-titled record nods to a handful of genres, as well. Pure pop, light R&B, syncopated gospel - the vibes present a cosmopolitan persona. Daigle is worldly and philosophical. All this comes to the fore on her live presentations of ""Saint Ferdinand"" and ""Don't Believe Them."" Fronting a tight little band, Daigle shows us her leadership skills while communicating deeply. Take a sec to absorb, and see how they make you feel.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

US President Joe Biden visits Angola in bid to rival China | BBC News,"US President Joe Biden has made his first and only visit to sub-Saharan Africa during his presidency, where he will highlight a US-backed railway project meant to counter China‚Äôs influence on the continent.

Biden‚Äôs three-day visit to oil-rich Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment which aims to advance the US presence in a region rich in the minerals used to make batteries for electric vehicles.

The railway line will stretch for 1,344km (835 miles) from the mines of Democratic Republic of Congo to the Angolan port city of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean.

Analysts view the Biden's trip as the most direct counter yet to China‚Äôs influence on the continent.

Trigonometry on Khan Academy: Big, fancy word, right? Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (""trig"" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question. Maybe you'll learn the answer from us in these tutorials!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Protesters occupy Iraqi parliament building in Baghdad for second day - BBC News,"Supporters of powerful Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr have stormed parliament for the second time in a week.

The protesters again breached the high-security Green Zone in Baghdad, as they oppose the nomination of a pro-Iran rival candidate for prime minister.

Over 120 people were injured in the latest unrest. Mr Sadr's block won the most seats last October, but it is not in power due to a political deadlock.

The most influential coalition in parliament has condemned the protest.

Matt Stell - I Bet Whiskey Would (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"Matt Stell - I Bet Whiskey Would - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

You‚Äôre not gonna miss Matt Stell. The singer behind ‚ÄúPrayed For You‚Äù is 6‚Äô7,‚Äù which just might make him the tallest dude in country music. Before he started writing songs and developing a regional following down South, the Arkansas native put that stature to good use by being part of hoops squads in both high school and college. But one lonely winter break, when the team had to remain on campus for practice while other students headed home, he picked up a pal‚Äôs guitar and started strumming to kill time. It was an a-ha moment, and this philosophy and religion major‚Äôs focus turned to music. He played blues and southern rock in local bars under the name Paul Wayne Walker so his coach wouldn‚Äôt know he had outside interests, and started writing songs. Turns out Stell's got a knack for lyrics, coming up with vivid phrases like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll drink whiskey mixed with moonlight.‚Äù A few years ago he made his impressive ‚ÄòA River Through It‚Äô EP, but things really changed in the summer of 2018 when the poignant power ballad ""Prayed For You"" captured the feels of everyone who‚Äôs ever had a romantic dream come true. With massive numbers on Vevo and Spotify, the song is part of Stell‚Äôs ‚ÄòEverywhere But On‚Äô EP, which is brimming over with other country gems, like ‚ÄúI Bet Whiskey Would.‚Äù And he likes to throw some curves at us, too. This Merle Haggard fan, whose early record collection included Hootie‚Äôs ‚ÄòCracked Rear Mirror‚Äô and Alanis‚Äô ‚ÄòJagged Little Pill,‚Äô does a sweet cover of Ariana‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod Is a Woman,‚Äù and dreams of hitting the studio with Kendrick Lamar. This past spring he debuted at the Grand Ole Opry, bringing fans what he calls ‚Äúbig, dark sounding songs that almost sound like arena rock but with country instrumentation: Arenacana.‚Äù You‚Äôll def get the feel when you see him in action in these Artists To Watch performances.

"If You See Bubbles in a Lake, You Have Only Seconds to Escape!","Living our everyday lives, sometimes it can feel like the same old, same old, and it‚Äôs easy to forget that this world holds some of the most fantastical things known to mankind. Sometimes you need to be reminded that you definitely haven‚Äôt seen it all, and no matter how long you‚Äôve lived on planet Earth, there will always be some sort of natural phenomena which will one day take you by surprise.

And even if you're good at physics and know the nature of different phenomena, you just can't help being surprised at how impressive they are. We're going to tell you about some of the rarest phenomena and weirdest places on Earth. For example, have you ever been to Alberta, Canada? There's Abraham Lake there, and in summer it looks just like any other lake on our planet. What you can see here in winter, however, is pure magic. But it's one of the most dangerous places in the world.

"Moroccan Street Food üá≤üá¶ Night Market Tour in Marrakesh, Morocco (Jema El Fnaa Square)","üá≤üá¶ Morocco Street Food in Marrakesh: https://youtu.be/mNqNF0iiWR0 
üëï T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/     

MARRAKESH, MOROCCO - One of the most thrilling places to eat Moroccan street food in the entire country is in Jema El Fnaa Square at night! So tonight we‚Äôre going on a Moroccan food tour to eat a few of the must eat dishes you have to try. 

A huge thank you to Moroccan Food Tour (https://moroccanfoodtour.com/) for arranging my trip to Morocco! 

Jema El Fnaa Square is a UNESCO world heritage site, and a place where people have gathered together for hundreds of years to tell stories, perform, snake charm, have food, and play instruments. It‚Äôs truly one of the most fascinating squares on earth. While daytime is calmer, at night you‚Äôll find an abundance of street food and performer and so after a full Marrakesh street food tour in the daytime (https://youtu.be/mNqNF0iiWR0), we‚Äôre going on an ultimate night market street food tour!

We first started with Harira, a porridge soup with tomato, lentils, and herbs. It‚Äôs a hearty dish, and really warm and comforting. Along with it, you can eat dates, chebekia sweets, or my preference for msemen - Moroccan stuffed flatbread.  

Here are the other places I tried: 

Hassan Snails, Stall #3 - Amazing Marrakesh herbal snails 
Chez Krita, Stall #14 - One of the oldest stalls at the market, and famous for seafood
Lamb Head, Stall #50 - Can‚Äôt go to Jema El Fnaa Square without a lamb head!
Chez Abdelouahed, Stall #66 - Iconic and extremely popular potato and egg sandwich 
Chez Hassan, Stall #70 Herbal Tea 

Jema El Fnaa Square is an overdose of everything - from music and dance, to a festival of tasty food, there are few places on earth more exciting if you love to eat!

Dancers, musicians and flag-waving well-wishers marked the occasion during a festival on Saturday.

On Sunday, the royal couple paraded in a convertible car along a 4.6-km (2.9-mile) route from the palace to their residence in central Tokyo to mark the enthronement.

The event was originally scheduled for 22 October but postponed after more than 80 people were killed when Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan and caused widespread damage.

Lyrics:

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb8NC4SC8Lc

Hokkien Fried Noodles in Phuket at Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô) Restaurant,"Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô) is one of Phuket‚Äôs famous restaurants for serving Hokkien style noodles. Get more details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/01/lock-tien-phuket/

Phuket is well known for its beaches, but I think it‚Äôs an amazing place in Thailand for trying delicious food. The island has a diversity of cultures and a mixture of influences including local Malay, Thai, Indian, Portuguese, and one of the largest influences of all, Chinese - many of whom have roots in either the Teochew or Hokkien (Fujian) people of China. The food and restaurants in Phuket reflect its diversity of cultures, and when you‚Äôre in Phuket you‚Äôll find plenty of Chinese restaurants. One of the most famous low-key everyday restaurants that‚Äôs reached near legendary status in Phuket town is a place called Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô), and they specialize in Hokkien style fried noodles.

One mid-morning my wife and I headed to Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô) restaurant to check it out and to get a taste of these beloved noodles in Phuket. The restaurant is popular for both locals and also there were many Bangkok Thai tourists eating there when we went as well. The restaurant is situated on the corner of Dibuk and Yaowarat roads, right on the edge of the Old Town of Phuket. It‚Äôs set up sort of like an open air street food court, with a number of different food carts positioned around the dining area. There is a menu, so you don‚Äôt go up to a cart to order like a food court, but when you order, whatever stall the dish you ordered comes from, they will bring you the dish.

For my main dish I ordered a bowl of mee leung pad Hokkien sai kai (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Æ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πÉ‡∏™‡πà‡πÉ‡∏Ç‡πà), or translated as fried yellow noodles Hokkien style, with an egg on top. I could smell the noodles as they were being cooked, the smoke of the wok filled the entire food court at Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô). The yellow noodles came in just a little bit of sauce, with some vegetables, a few pieces of char siu Chinese bbq pork, some seafood pieces, and finally a soft boiled egg on the side of my bowl. It was a marvelous bowl of noodles. It had a smoky flavor from being fried on such a high heat, and it was just salty enough, and I really liked the gravy, which was rich and full of flavor. The noodles were slightly gooey, and then combined with the extra richness of the egg, and the pieces of squid and vegetables, it was excellent. I also garnished my bowl of Hokkien fried noodles (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Æ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πÉ‡∏™‡πà‡πÉ‡∏Ç‡πà) with some vinegar and some dry chili flakes to add even more delicious flavor. 

Along with my bowl of noodles, we also ordered a plate of pork satay (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πä‡∏∞), called moo satay in Thai. The meat was nicely seasoned and coated in the richness of coconut milk. The sauce was a little on the sweet side for me, but it did have a nice peanut base, and I also liked the pickles that came with this version of satay. Overall, it wasn‚Äôt the best Thai pork satay (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πä‡∏∞) I‚Äôve ever had, but it wasn‚Äôt bad. Also, although I didn‚Äôt try it, one of the other famous Phuket foods to eat at Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô) are the fresh spring rolls called por pia sot. So if you‚Äôre interested in giving them a try, they are available and many have said they are very good.

Overall, I think Lock Tien (‡∏•‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ô) is a pretty good and easy restaurant to eat at in Phuket.

‚≠êQui est MSF?
MSF est une organisation humanitaire m√©dicale internationale cr√©√©e par des m√©decins et des journalistes en France en 1971. MSF fournit une aide dans pr√®s de 80 pays √† des personnes dont la survie est menac√©e par la violence, la n√©gligence ou la catastrophe, principalement en raison de conflits arm√©s, d'√©pid√©mies, de malnutrition, d'exclusion de soins de sant√© ou catastrophes naturelles. MSF fournit une assistance ind√©pendante et impartiale √† ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. MSF a re√ßu le prix Nobel de la paix en 1999 et le prix King Hussein pour l'action humanitaire en 2004.

Quel est le travail de MSF?
Dans les situations d'urgence et leurs suites, MSF fournit des soins de sant√©, r√©habilite et g√®re des h√¥pitaux et des cliniques, effectue des interventions chirurgicales, lutte contre les √©pid√©mies, m√®ne des campagnes de vaccination, g√®re des centres d'alimentation pour les enfants souffrant de malnutrition et propose des soins de sant√© mentale. Au besoin, MSF construit √©galement des puits et distribue de l'eau potable, et fournit des mat√©riaux d'abri tels que des couvertures et des b√¢ches en plastique.

MSF est-elle une agence des Nations Unies?
Non. MSF est une organisation ind√©pendante qui fonctionne sans aucun programme politique, militaire ou religieux. Les activit√©s de MSF ne sont li√©es √† aucune des agences des Nations Unies. Cependant, MSF peut plaider aupr√®s des Nations Unies sur les probl√®mes m√©dicaux et humanitaires courants.

O√π travaille MSF?
MSF travaille principalement dans les pays o√π elle a trouv√© des services insuffisants pour r√©pondre aux besoins m√©dicaux d'une population. MSF est pr√©sent dans plus de 60 pays √† travers le monde en Asie, en Afrique, en Europe et en Am√©rique latine.

Les services MSF sont-ils gratuits?
Oui. Tous les services MSF sont gratuits. MSF rejette l'id√©e que les pays pauvres m√©ritent des soins m√©dicaux de troisi√®me ordre et s'efforce de fournir des soins de haute qualit√© aux patients et recherche du personnel hautement professionnel (m√©dical et non m√©dical). Par exemple, dans la mission MSF qui soigne les bless√©s de guerre irakiens, MSF couvre toutes les d√©penses li√©es au traitement, y compris les frais de voyage, d'h√©bergement, etc.

D'o√π vient l'argent de MSF?
La cl√© de la capacit√© de MSF √† agir de mani√®re ind√©pendante en r√©ponse √† une crise est son financement priv√© et ind√©pendant. En 2015, 92% des revenus de MSF provenaient de sources priv√©es. Plus de 5,7 millions de donateurs individuels et de fondations priv√©es dans le monde ont rendu cela possible.

La pr√©sence de MSF est-elle toujours bas√©e sur une base temporaire ou d'urgence?
MSF ne repr√©sente pas une alternative pour les formations sanitaires des pays o√π elle intervient. MSF essaie de combler le vide des besoins m√©dicaux et humanitaires. Lorsque ces besoins sont satisfaits, MSF c√®de la place aux √©tablissements de sant√© locaux et apporte son soutien aux autres populations dans le besoin.

Stop Saying AVOID | Learn 10 Better Alternatives & Speak English Like A Pro | Spoken English Lesson,"Stop Saying AVOID | Learn 10 Better Alternatives | Speak English Like A Pro! | English Speaking Lesson | Michelle  #englishspeaking #learnenglish #speakenglish

In this lesson I will teach 10 better alternatives to the word AVOID. We use the word avoid most of the times in our conversation. It's my observation that ‚Äòavoid‚Äô is a weak command or at least has the connotation? It makes your sentences sound weaker. If you want to sound like an advanced English speaker, learn to use better and alternative English words instead of basic English words. 

You are watching this lesson on Let‚Äôs Talk - YouTube Channel with more than 1500 plus free English speaking lessons to make you speak fluent English. You will find topics such as English grammar rules, Accent Training, Us Accent, UK accent, IELTS Speaking test training videos, Videos for Job Interview Skills, Words with meaning for competitive exams, English conversation practice, Tips to learn English and much more.

Mayotte: Growing fears of high death toll after Cyclone Chido | BBC News,"There are concerns that the cyclone that hit the French island of Mayotte has caused great loss of life.
 
Cyclone Chido brought wind speeds of more than 225km/h (140mph), flattening areas where the poorest lived in sheet-metal roof shacks.
 
A surgeon said the emergency department at his hospital has seen worryingly few patients given the scale of the destruction.
 
Authorities said they were having difficulty establishing the number of deaths due to the large number of undocumented migrants - over 100,000 - in a population of 320,000.

"Ultimate CHAPLI KEBABS! | Extreme Pakistani Street Food in Mardan, Pakistan!","SUBSCRIBE http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every week
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l
Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjH

I can say with certainty, chapli kebabs are probably the best form or shape of any kebab or meat patty formation that I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. This was my first time to try this Pakistani food speciality, and I was blown away with every bite. Chapli kebabs are extraordinary!

Islamabad - Capital Pakistan - So we started off the day in Islamabad, but the plan for the day was to drive to Mardan, eat along the way, and eat our way through Mardan, but mostly focusing the day on chapli kebabs.

Mian Jee Restaurant - One the way to Mardan we stopped at Mian Jee, a very famous restaurant know for all sorts of dishes, but especially their world famous dal. It‚Äôs so thick and creamy it‚Äôs almost the consistency of peanut butter. And yes, it‚Äôs rich and delicious.

Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan - We arrived in Mardan in the early afternoon and headed straight to eat chapli kebabs for the first time.

Chapli Kebab - Mardan - The first place we are chapli kebab was a local favorite spot in Mardan city. I‚Äôm not exactly sure of the name, but it‚Äôs a very popular spot and known by locals. They had the massive podium fryer, filled with melted fat, and made medium sized burger patties, with big chunks of bone marrow to make this even better. Their chapli kebabs (kababs) were seasoned perfectly with a balance of tomato and cumin. It was an eye opener for me.

Falooda - Next we stopped in Mardan to eat falooda, and from what I understand, Mardan falooda is pretty famous.

River View Restaurant - Next on this day of Mardan and Peshawar, we drove to River View Restaurant, mainly to go on a boat ride in the Kabul River. The river ride was fun, and it was amazing to be cruising down the Kabul river. The restaurant also had delicious food.

Rambail Chapli Kebab, Taru Jabba - But for our real dinner we needed to get another dose of chapli kebabs. On the way, almost to Peshawar city, we stopped at Rambail Chapli Kebab, Taru Jabba, possibly the most famous of all chapli kebab in the world. And when you see their bonfire and podium of a cooking station, you‚Äôll know why it‚Äôs the best. They make larger sized patties, filled with spices, and bone marrow, and again fried in their own fat.

The chapli kebabs were so unbelievably delicious, I could hardly control myself. It was an amazing day of Pakistani street food in Pakistan, and an intro to chapli kebabs from the source.

Music starts
Dancing begins
You grab my heart and pull it in 
Closer to your heart beat is the tempo now 
Here we are
No one is left
The two of us
And nothing else
Ever compares to this moment 

I love to sing to You
There is nothing else that I would rather do 
Everything that I desire is found in You
Jesus, Oh Jesus You 
Are my love song 

The times have changed
Sound has evolved
But You remain
Unmoved at all
By anything I‚Äôve done to You
So I am coming back
With a voice
Don‚Äôt need a stage 
To open up
So much to say 
So I will let my heart do the talking 

I love to sing to You
There is nothing else that I would rather do 
Everything that I desire is found in You
Jesus, Oh Jesus You 
Are my love song 

I love to sing to You
There is nothing else that I would rather do 
My heart and my desire is found in You
Jesus, Oh Jesus You 
Are my love song",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFa64gnFyI
President Biden says US will defend Taiwan if China attacks - BBC News,"President Joe Biden said the US would defend Taiwan if China attacked, in an apparent departure from a long-held US foreign policy position.

But a White House spokesman later told some US media outlets that his remarks did not signify a change in policy.

The US has a law which requires it to help Taiwan defend itself.

10 Rare Diseases That Turn People Into Superheroes,"People tend to associate an illness with something unpleasant and often dangerous, and they have their reasons to think so. But there are some diseases which, unlike a common cold, look like superpowers. At least at first sight.

In this video, you will get acquainted with some of them. These rare diseases not only leave scientists confused but also make their carriers similar to superheroes!

Have you caught a cold? Oh, how unlucky! All these nasty symptoms again: a runny nose, non-stop coughing, and also, it hurts to eat! But you know what? Quit nagging! Your illness will pass in (about) a week. But imagine the life of those who suffer from chronic diseases! 

TIMESTAMPS
Super memory 1:06
Insensibility to pain 2:28
Abilities to literally anything 3:47
Insensitivity to cold 5:01
The complete absence of fear 5:58
The Vampire disorder 7:03
Octopus people 8:38
Stone Man Syndrome 9:38
Werewolf Syndrome 10:20
Foreign accent syndrome 11:21

SUMMARY
- This condition is called hyperthymesia - a disruption of memory which causes a person to remember all the events of their life down to every last detail. There are just about 60 people in the world who have been diagnosed with such a unique disease. 
- In-born analgesia - that's a scientific name of the condition when a person doesn't feel pain. Like, at all. There is a surprising fact to think about: despite the rareness of this disease, as many as 40 cases of it have been registered in one of the villages in Sweden. 
-     Savant syndrome is a rare condition which might be typical for people with developmental disorders, such as autism or Asperger's syndrome. Patients with such condition are extremely talented in music, drawing and painting, calculations, cartography, and constructing 3D models. 
-     Besides people who don't react to pain, there are those who are indifferent to cold. A vivid example is Wim Hof - a man from the Netherlands who brought doctors to their wit's end.  The thing is Wim is able to stand very low temperatures. He managed to spend 120 minutes in a pipe with freezing water and ice, has climbed to the top of Mont Blanc wearing shorts (and his pen), and even swims under the ice of frozen lakes and rivers.
- Urbach-Wiethe disease is a rare genetic disorder which leads to the complete lack of fear. Only 300 cases are known, and a quarter of them have been registered in South Africa. 
- Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia. People suffering from this condition frequently have eerily pointed teeth, therefore, looking similar to the legendary blood-feeding creatures from horror films. People with more prominent symptoms of this illness are extremely thin and pale; their eyes are outlined with dark circles.
- Polymelia is a strange disorder. People suffering from it are born with an unusual number of limbs. In some cases, these limbs are pretty useful, in others they are non-functioning. 
- This syndrome is genetic, what is more, it progresses throughout life. People with such a disease have the soft tissues of their bodies turning into bone. The mutation of the ACVR1 gene responsible for the development of different tissues of the human body leads to terrible consequences.
- The hair growth of such people is abnormal. All their bodies are covered with thick hair, it grows, long and lush, even on their faces. The reason for this condition which has gained the nickname ""werewolf syndrome"" is most likely to be the genetic mutation. 
- Foreign accent syndrome. The most common reason for this condition is a head injury or a stroke. The person with this condition changes the way they place their tongue during speaking. The most effective treatment, in this case, is the speech therapy. 

Which disease have you found the most shocking?  Have you ever met anybody with the conditions described in the video?

The Yazidi family reunited after being IS slaves - BBC News,"Since the fall of the Islamic State group‚Äôs attempted caliphate in Syria, hundreds of its prisoners have been freed.
Few were brutalised more by IS than Yazidis, a religious minority who were captured and enslaved when IS swept through their homeland in Sinjar, northern Iraq.
The UN says IS killed or enslaved thousands of Yazidis, and attempted to wipe them out ‚Äì an act of genocide.
Men were murdered and buried in mass graves. Women were raped. Mothers and children were bought, sold and made to work as servants for IS fighters.
But some, like Nashaat, survived. After four years separated from his mother Fawzia, they're about to be reunited.

US election 2020: What young Democrats think of Joe Biden - BBC News,"Joe Biden is about to be crowned as the Democrats' presidential nominee - but what do young millennials and Generation Z voters who support the party think of their candidate?

At the age of 77, the former vice-president is half a century older than the dozen voters we spoke to - yet it's his moderate politics rather than the age gap which has many struggling to get excited.

A Lot of People Tried to Erase This Pharaon from History But Failed,"When you hear ‚ÄúEgyptian Pharaoh‚Äù, what image immediately comes to your mind? Probably a man wearing a blue and golden headdress, sitting on a throne surrounded by servants? Picturing a man would be accurate 95% of the time since very few females became pharaohs in all of Ancient Egypt‚Äôs 3,000-year history. To be precise, there were 7 female pharaohs among the 170 that ruled Egypt over time. One of those women was Hatshepsut, and how she came to power as a great Leader of Egypt is a rare story.

SUMMARY:
- In 1507 BCE, a girl was born, and she would be named ""Foremost of Noble Women"". You might know her as Hatshepsut. She was the daughter of Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose, his first and main wife. 
- Hatshepsut‚Äôs half-brother Thutmose II officially became the new ruler of Egypt, and the two got married. 
- The bright and tactful Hatshepsut, who probably felt that she was born to rule being the daughter and wife of two kings by now, was determined to get what was rightfully hers.
- But there was the problem of her primary competition. That was Thutmose III, the son of the deceased pharaoh and another wife of his. 
- Hatshepsut took advantage of the situation and appointed herself his regent.
- She had a legend on her side. According to the myth, Hatshepsut was actually the daughter of Amun, that Egyptian deity I mentioned earlier. 
- Hatshepsut might‚Äôve been strong and powerful, but she clearly wasn‚Äôt a guy ‚Äì legend has it that she was actually a very beautiful woman. 
- At important public events, she wore men's clothes and a fake beard. 
- The ruler focused more on developing her own country instead of expanding it by conquering new lands. 
- The most impressive construction of Hatshepsut‚Äôs rule was the temple at Deir el-Bahari. This temple is considered one of the architectural wonders of Ancient Egypt, and it‚Äôs also where she was buried. 
- Her prosperous reign lasted a little more than 2 decades until her death some 22 years after taking the throne. 
- The name of the Queen was excluded from the list of pharaohs of Egypt, and her portraits were destroyed. 
- But Hatshepsut was smart and she most likely expected something like this would happen. So, during her years on the throne, she managed to sprinkle reliefs and artwork of herself in lots of different places so that it‚Äôd be impossible to erase everything.

#cleaning #aromatherapy #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Before you put a new empty bag inside the can, clean it well, because the can itself accumulates smells that stick around.
- Use dryer sheets as a deodorant. Place them in shoe closets, musty areas, trash cans, and gym bags. 
- Another tip with dryer sheets that works like magic ‚Äì put a few of them behind the vents in every room.
- To chase away bacteria that accumulates in the carpet and get rid of urine smells, rub the carpet with a vinegar and water mix with a cloth, and then rinse it well with water. 
- Your favorite sneakers can make the whole closet stink, but that‚Äôs no reason to throw them away. Instead, try sprinkling baking soda inside them and leave it overnight. 
- Tie some strong fragrant herbs like lemon balm, thyme or rosemary in the far corner of the shower to keep them away from water. 
- Another obvious stinky source is the toilet. Vinegar will help you combat that. Pour one cup inside, and spray the seat and the outsides with it as well.
- To keep your garbage disposal from smelling like total trash, drop a sliced lemon, lime or an orange in it when it‚Äôs running. 
- Your fridge accumulates all sorts of smells from the food inside. Baking soda, with its unique chemical properties, will help to absorb them and make it smell neutral.
- Stuff a nylon stocking with coffee grounds and keep it in the back of the fridge for a natural deodorizing effect. 
- To fix the odor problems in your ice box, swipe it on the inside with a cotton ball soaked in vanilla extract.
- To make your kitchen, or the entire house, smell like a citrus garden, use orange peels! Dry them overnight, then boil 5 or 6 of them in a pot of water with the lid off for a couple of hours. 
- To make the microwave smell like new with basically no effort, drop a sponge or rag you use to do the dishes soaked in dishwasher inside and turn it on for about 5 minutes.
- Activated charcoal will help you solve the stinky kitty litter problem. It‚Äôs naturally great at absorbing odors, especially those produced by pets.

What If Mountains Continued to Grow All the Time,"Being the tallest mountain on the surface of our planet, Mount Everest's peak reaches a dizzying height of 29,030 ft. But the most amazing thing about this giant is that it's still growing! It gets one-tenth of an inch taller every year! But what if all mountains on Earth never stopped growing?

First of all, it would make flying impossible. Sailing, as well, would become too dangerous. Mountaineers wouldn‚Äôt be able to conquer mountain peaks anymore. The mass of all other mountains on Earth would be getting bigger and bigger as well. Let‚Äôs find out if this scenario is possible in real life.

SUMMARY:
-In a week, helicopters would stop flying in particularly mountainous regions. When, in about a month, mountains reach the height of 40,000 ft, people realize that traveling somewhere far away isn't as easy as it used to be ‚Äì flying would become too risky. 
-There are more than 100,000 seamounts in the world, with about 30,000 of them in the Pacific Ocean. That's why container and cruise ships would rest in ports until people try to figure out safe routes that won't end up in any shipwreck. 
-People would start to feel altitude sickness already at the height of 8,000 ft. Climbing any higher than Everest? Unlikely. 
-The mass of all other mountains on Earth would be getting bigger and bigger as well! And the more substantial the mass of something becomes, the stronger the gravity of this object gets. 
-From time to time, tectonic plates collide, and the plates' touching edges get pushed upward forming new mountains. There are also volcanic mountains - molten rock starts to pile up, and eventually, a mountain is formed.
-The crust of the Red Planet isn't divided into tectonic plates, the crust doesn't move, and all the lava gets piled up into one tremendous volcano. 
-By eroding the materials a mountain is made of, rivers can trigger landslides ‚Äî and those don‚Äôt let the mountain grow as tall as it could otherwise.

US President Biden issues official pardon for son Hunter | BBC News,"US President Joe Biden has issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases.

In a statement, the president said his son had been ""singled out"", and called his cases ""a miscarriage of justice.""

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.

The full and unconditional pardon comes after the president had previously said he would not give his son clemency.

Megan Moroney - I'm Not Pretty (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Megan Moroney - I‚Äôm Not Pretty (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

A check-in on what‚Äôs happenin‚Äô down in Nashville has been long overdue for our DSCVR program. So we tapped in with a name that‚Äôs been on a lot of lips in Music City this year: Megan Moroney. The rising singer-songwriter‚Äôs breakout track ‚ÄúTennessee Orange‚Äù employs one of country music‚Äôs best tropes: using a regional phenomenon (pickup trucks, cowboy boots, etc.) as a metaphor for something deeper. In this case, the South‚Äôs hot-blooded college rivalries threaten to throw a wrench in an equally steamy young romance. It‚Äôs the SEC version of ‚ÄòRomeo and Juliet,‚Äô trading the Montagues and Capulets for Tennessee Volunteers and Georgia Bulldogs. Meg plays a convincing Juliet, innocently beseeching momma ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell daddy/he‚Äôll blow a fuse.‚Äù Moroney actually attended the University of Georgia, where she planned to study accounting before capitalizing on a chance to open a show for Chase Rice her freshman year. That‚Äôs the kind of authenticity that her 1+ million followers have come to expect. Major outlets are all in, too. Rolling Stone called her debut album ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô one of the best albums of 2023 so far; American Songwriter praised its mix of relatable somber songs and mood boosting anthems. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Pretty‚Äù falls in the latter category. Its sly wordplay, smooth arrangements, and conviction will remind listeners of early Kacey Musgraves and Taylor Swift, two of Meg‚Äôs idols. Conversely, ‚ÄúSad Songs For Sad People‚Äù contains the confession ‚ÄúI want every word to hurt/like blue eyes cryin' in the rain.‚Äù Gotta love the slick Willie reference, too. Can‚Äôt wait to see her tread her own country road.

10 Superpowers You Had When You Were a Baby,"10 Unique Superpowers Kids Are All Born With. Only babies have the following superpowers, and we are sure you will want to have some of them yourself!
If you or your close friends or family have babies, you already know how amazing they are. Everything they do, especially when it‚Äôs for the first time, is a reason for admiration and celebration. First word? ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the camera so we can record it!‚Äù It gets even better when they learn to crawl, sit and stand and walk! Some people, however, are a bit skeptical about babies‚Äô talents and abilities. How dare they!
We have proof that babies have unique and surprising superpowers. More than that, we are sure you will want to have some of them yourself. Sadly, you can‚Äôt. 

TIMESTAMPS
Babies don‚Äôt cry. 1:08
They feel great underwater. 2:11
They swallow and breathe at¬†the same time. 3:06
If¬†necessary, babies can sneeze continuously. 3:42
They fall asleep easily. 4:41
They have a¬†natural accent. 5:29
Newborns know how to¬†crawl.  6:23
Babies are very flexible. 7:04
Their hairstyle may change drastically. 7:30
A¬†baby can triple its weight and not get fat. 8:40

SUMMARY
- In¬†the first year of¬†their life, babies are developing rapidly. During this period, the weight of¬†a¬†baby may¬†triple. However, the child‚Äôs constitution is¬†not affected in¬†any way because it¬†grows very quickly. From birth to 6-months age babies normally grow 1/2 to 1 inch and gain 5 to 7 ounces a week. So, they often double their weight by the time they are five months old. In between 6 and 12 months of age, babies might grow 3/8 inch a month and gain 3 to 5 ounces a week. So, they normally triple their weight by their first anniversary. 
- Scientists¬†have found out¬†that babies cry with a¬†national accent. Researchers have recorded cries of 60 babies born in German or French families and found they have the same melody as in their native language by the second day of life! They get it¬†in¬†the womb when hearing their mother‚Äôs voice. 
- According to¬†scientists, infants are attracted by¬†the smell of¬†milk, which lures them. Some experts believe birth attendants should give Mom and baby at least an hour to bond and feed before they take care of the baby. This will give him a chance to follow the natural instinct and crawl to his mother‚Äôs breast and feed as nature has planned it. 
- The skeleton of¬†a¬†baby has about¬†300¬†bones. With age, many of¬†them grow and coalesce into a¬†single whole. So, a grown adult has 206 bones.¬†But before the bones are connected, the body of¬†a¬†newborn is¬†extremely flexible.

"Willie Jones - Get Low, Get High (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2022","Willie Jones - Get Low, Get High. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 


If country music and hip-hop share one key element, it‚Äôs authenticity. The genres have historically been like two cooks in a Food Network competition, swearing that their scrumptious dish better incorporates the secret ingredient. Enter Willie Jones, a charismatic newcomer putting fusion on the menu. The Shreveport, Louisiana native isn‚Äôt the first to blend the two styles, of course. Country-rap has had its progenitors. Nelly and Tim McGraw‚Äôs 2009 ‚ÄúOver and Over‚Äù did a great job of priming a generation for crossovers. A decade later, ‚ÄúOld Town Road‚Äù proved that the blend could shatter chart records AND deliver a superstar in Lil Nas X. Jones is taking it further, however. He‚Äôs the only artist who has had a video simultaneously premiere on both CMT and BET. ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù is told from the poignant perspective of a Black man grappling with patriotism in the wake of the George Floyd protests. So back to that authenticity factor. Jones‚Äô debut album ‚ÄòRight Now,‚Äô is the result of a fascination with country and hip-hop that he has had since his early teens. His deep knowledge of both genres comes through to make the music‚Äôs subtle balance just right, Goldilocks style. ‚ÄúGet Low, Get High‚Äù recently premiered on the singer‚Äôs Apple Music show, ‚ÄòThe Crossroads Radio.‚Äô ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna raise your vibrations and put you in a good mood,‚Äù he proclaimed. Along with the new ‚ÄúSoul Food,‚Äù he played ‚ÄúGet Low, Get High‚Äù live for DSCVR Artists to Watch 2022, and the uplifting effect was immediate. Inspirational stuff, Mr. Jones.

The Unexpected Reason Why Escalators Have Brushes,"Ever been in that awkward situation when you're in a room with people you barely know, and no one knows what to say? The silence seems endless‚Ä¶ Well, why don't you tell everyone why snow crunches? Or why escalators have brushes along the edges? 

Also, most people don't know that some small birds and insects see the world in slo-mo. Or that cats can be allergic to you! (The only reason this allergy doesn't show so often is that you don't shed as much irritating hair and skin as they do). Or that reindeer's eyes change color from gold in the summer to baby blue in the winter! Or some other, no less exciting facts!

SUMMARY:
- The burning sensation you have in your mouth after eating chili peppers is caused by a particular chemical compound in them. 
- If you think your cat loves to catch some Z's, what will you say about koalas? These marsupials sleep from 18 to 22 hours a day! 
- Have you ever got chills while listening to music? It was your brain releasing dopamine - a chemical compound that causes pleasure. 
- Continental plates keep drifting at the same speed your fingernails grow. An underground activity that makes them move also causes volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
- You've probably noticed that the colder it is outside, the louder the snow crunches under your feet. It happens because when the snow compresses, teeny ice grains rub against each other. 
- Just one bolt of lightning will provide enough energy for a two-slice toaster to work for 84,000 minutes. 
- Roosters can be exceptionally loud, and the question is, ""How do they not go deaf if this thundering noise is coming right out of their beaks?"" Simple - they have a natural mechanism that works as built-in earplugs!
- The very first helicopters had wooden rotor blades. At that time, fiberglass hadn‚Äôt been invented yet, and wood was the best available material: strong, lightweight, and fatigue-resistant.  
- Dogs can distinguish way more smells than humans. But when it comes to tasting something, people win hands down. 
- Astronauts in space have to work out no less than 2 hours a day to keep their bodies strong. 
- At any given moment, around 2,000 thunderstorms are happening in different places on Earth. And if we add up one full year, this number will be more than 16 million!

Lyrics
 
Hey babys
Tell me your name
I got a fever for you
I just can't explain
But there's just one problem
I'm a bit old-school
When it comes to lovin'
I ain't chasing you
Ain't waiting
I'm on a roll
You've got to let yourself go

Oh (talk to me)
You know that I've been waiting for you
(and I noticed you, too)
Don't leave me standing all by myself
(I won't leave you standing all alone)
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else
(oh, baby)

Hey,
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot,
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Oh silly
Why you afraid?
Don't be a big baby
Quit playing games
And put your arms around me
You know what to do
And we can take it down low

Oh
You know that I've been waiting for you (for you!)
Don't leave me standing all by myself (myself!)
Cause I ain't looking at no one else
(looking at no one else, looking at no one else)

Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

I know that you wanna
But you can't
'cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move
So move
I know that you wanna
But you can't
'cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move
So move

Move it baby
You know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else
Looking at no one else

Hey! Hey! I'm ready, hey!
Boy come and get me
Don't be scared
Show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?
Hey! Hey!
I'm ready, hey!
Boy come and get me
Don't be scared
Show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?

Hey,
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Hey! Hey! I'm ready, hey!
Boy, come and get me
Don't be scared
Show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?

Mia Khalifa: Why I‚Äôm speaking out about the porn industry - BBC News,"The human preoccupation with sex is nothing new ‚Äì but the internet has made it so much easier to explore and exploit every shade of desire. The online porn industry makes billions of dollars in profit every year, but the big winners are corporate players, not the women and men performing the sex acts. Stephen Sackur interviews Mia Khalifa. 

She was briefly a porn actress, garnering worldwide notoriety when she appeared in a sex video wearing the Islamic hijab. After years of threats and insecurity, she‚Äôs speaking out. What does her story tells us about the porn industry and 21st century culture?

Sri Lanka protestors sceptical that president will quit - BBC News,"Sri Lankan protesters are sceptical that the president will step down - and are refusing to leave the presidential palace until he does so.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he would step down on 13 July, according to an announcement made by the parliament's speaker on Saturday. But the president has not been seen or made a public statement himself.

Thousands descended on Colombo on Saturday demanding his resignation after months of protests.

Sri Lanka is in deep financial crisis and the crowds say they won't leave until both men quit their posts.

What If a Tornado Got in Water Filled with Sharks?,"A tornado is whipping through the air and then decides to take a dip in a body of water teeming with sharks. Now that's a mashup you won't find in any oceanography textbook. Sharks are the apex predators of the sea, masters of their underwater domain. But when they meet a tornado, it's like their entire world is turned upside down (literally). Tornadoes are powerful and chaotic, and if they dare to descend into shark-infested waters, those sleek swimmers might just swim for their lives. Imagine the tornado's massive winds churning the water, causing turbulence that sharks aren't used to dealing with.

Shake Shack in NYC - Eating The Double Shack Burger!,"‚ñ∫Follow Sarah on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ohkworld/

‚ñ∫Check out my NYC food guide: https://goo.gl/xubRjU

Shake Shack is one of the most famous NYC fast food burger chains, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave NYC without trying it. We then went to church and then on to eat Ethiopian food!

00:35 Stumptown Coffee Roasters - I‚Äôm a big fan of coffee, and since it wasn‚Äôt too far away from where we were staying, we started off the day by going to Stumptown Coffee Roasters. I ordered an Americano which was wonderful, and a cold brew to go. Americano - $3.25
Cold brew - $4.50

1:38 Flatiron Building / Madison Square Park - While drinking my coffee, we were just enjoying New York City walking around leisurely. We had a great view of the famous Flatiron building, and then we continued on walking around Madison Square Park. 

2:41 Shake Shack at Madison Square Park - I wasn‚Äôt actually planning to eat at Shake Shack today, but since we happen to be at Madison Square Park and since it was just a little while before they opened for the day, I decided it would be the perfect opportunity to try Shake Shack for the first time. I ordered the double Shack burger, which came with all the toppings. I‚Äôll let you watch the full video for a full review of the burger and Shake Shack, but what stood out to me was the beef and the bun, which were about as excellent as fast food can get for me. Full Shake Shack review within the video. Double Shack Burger - $8.09, Chicken Shack - $6.29, Fries - $2.99

12:02 Hillsong Church NYC - After eating Shake Shack, since it was Sunday, we walked over to Hillsong Church NYC to attend the service. It was huge!

‚ñ∫Check out Sarah‚Äôs website: http://www.ohkworld.com/#story

12:58 Meske Ethiopian Restaurant - After church we headed to Meske Ethiopian Restaurant, which is one of Sarah‚Äôs favorite Ethiopian restaurants in NYC. It was so good to hang out with Sarah and to eat Ethiopian food ‚Äî it had been way too long! We ordered the special tibs, doro wat, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Total price - about $90

17:19 Luke's Lobster - Finally for dinner, since it was our final day in NYC, I didn‚Äôt want to leave without trying lobster roll. I wasn‚Äôt able to go to the exact location I had wanted to go, but I there was a Luke‚Äôs Lobster not too far from where I was staying. Lobster roll - $18.51 - It tasted food, but it was pretty expensive.

Discovering Your Inner Physicist with Neil deGrasse Tyson,"In an all-animal Olympics, what event would we win? Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O‚ÄôReilly discuss the innate physics understanding in humans.  We explore human‚Äôs ability to catch moving objects and hand-eye coordination. Is there such a thing as over-pursuit? Who makes more spectacular catches: someone who is fast or someone who is slow? All that, plus, we marvel at the natural physicist within all of us.

Lyrics: 
I may not know what‚Äôs ahead
But I know who He is
He is my hope and my defense
Love that never ends
That‚Äôs just who He is
 
He‚Äôs my anchor in the waves
He's my healer in the pain
He‚Äôs my compass when I can‚Äôt see the way
He‚Äôs my ever-present help in time of need
My strength when I am weak
That‚Äôs the reason I sing
 
When my fear‚Äôs surrounding me
And the shadow's all I see
He‚Äôs the light and He‚Äôs the lamp to my feet
He‚Äôs my ever-present help in time of need
My strength when I am weak
That‚Äôs the reason I sing
(Who He is)
Oooohhh that's
(Who He Is)
He‚Äôs never gonna let me go
(Who He Is)
And I'm just gonna let you know
(Who He Is)
Joy in the morning, peace in the evening
(Who He Is)
He‚Äôs my Savior and my friend
(Who He Is)
He is my hope and my defense
Love that never ends
That‚Äôs just who He is

LYRICS
Do You Love Me

Don't know why I'm feeling so unsure
How much I wanna hold you makes me insecure
I'm finding myself wide awake while you are sleeping
I don't recognise myself, overanalysing

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Afraid that I'll wake up and you'll be gone
I feel like I've been waiting for something to go wrong
Have you everyday and you're still getting sweeter
But I'm still fighting with myself, overanalysing

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Morning comes, realise that I was crazy
But you're too good to be true
I've come undone, pinching myself lately
Losing sleep, asking myself

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Do you love do you love do you love me baby
When you kiss when you touch when you touch me baby
Do you love do you love do you love me baby
When you kiss when you touch when you touch me baby

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Bangkok Street Food at Sukhumvit Soi 38 (‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ó ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 38),"Sukhumvit Soi 38 is a well known Bangkok street food street. Read the full post here: http://migrationology.com/2014/04/sukhumvit-soi-38-convenient-street-food-bangkok/

When you visit Bangkok, one of the greatest things to do is explore the amazing Bangkok street food. You'll find delicious street food everywhere you look, and there are even certain streets where you'll find a higher concentration of street food carts, usually in the morning or at night. One of the most famous streets for eating a range of Thai street food dishes is Sukhumvit Soi 38 (by the way, ""soi"" is the Thai word for small street or side street). It's very easy to get there by just taking the BTS skytrain to Thong Lo station, and just down from the BTS you'll be right there. The street is located in an area of Bangkok where there are plenty of expats, especially Japanese.

But anyway, I'm going to first tell you that Sukhumvit Soi 38 does not have the best Bangkok street food. It's not the best selection of food, and what is available is good but not amazing. However, the street does present a very good place for an introduction to Thai street food, a street where you can sample a variety of Thai dishes from street food vendors. I had not been to Sukhumvit Soi 38 for a few years when I made this video (just because I usually try to explore new places), but one thing I was impressed with was that many of the vendors were very friendly - so that's a huge bonus when it comes to eating street food - and I think Suk Soi 38 makes a great place for an introduction to Thai street food in Bangkok.

I arrived at about 5 pm, and a few of the vendors still hadn't opened shop. If you go by around 6 pm or so, then most of the vendors should be ready and serving. As soon as you get to Soi 38, you'll see a small side street to your right hand side where you'll find a famous Pad Thai vendors, as well a number of other vendors, even one Korean and a Japanese street food cart - everyone is getting in on the action. If you keep going further down the street you'll find plenty of Bangkok street food vendors on both sides of the road. About 20 meters down the road, on the right hand side of the street you'll find a small food court like seating where about 3 or 4 vendors serve. We first ate at the yam (‡∏¢‡∏≥), or Thai salad stall, as I had heard that the som tam boo maa (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏π‡∏°‡πâ‡∏≤), Thai green papaya salad with blue crab was delicious. It was very good, nice and balanced, and the crab tasted pretty fresh to me. Along with another few Thai salads, it was a nice way to begin out Thai street food crawl on Suk Soi 38.

Continuing on, you'll discover all sorts of other street food stalls, serving Bangkok classic dishes like khao moo daeng (rice with red pork), khao man gai (rice chicken), and a host of other Thai noodles dishes, both fried and in soup. After walking the length of the street a few times, I decided just to go for a dish I rarely eat, known as khao man gai (chicken rice). I ordered khao man gai ruam (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏°), a mix of rice topped with both fried chicken and boiled chicken. It's not my favorite Thai street food dish, but it was alright, and especially the extra hits of fresh raw ginger and chilies really helped to increase the flavor. After street food meal in Bangkok, there's always an option for something sweet. I'm not really a sweet tooth myself, but since my wife enjoys sweet, we went to a famous place along the soi for dessert - Mook Dow Tung (‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏∂‡∏á) - located on the right hand side of the street - it's more of a shophouse than a street food stall. They are especially famous for their ice cream, and for their nam kang sai (shave ice with toppings). The ice cream was pretty good, homemade and creamy, and it tasted fresh and flavorful.

How to get to Sukhumvit Soi 38: It's really conveniently located, just of the Thong Lo BTS (‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏´‡∏•‡πà‡∏≠) station in Bangkok. Take the BTS to Thong Long, get out at Exit 4, and you'll see the street with the street food vendors right below - you won't miss it.
Open hours: About 5 pm - 2 am daily, but depends on the vendor
Prices: Prices can be a bit higher than other Bangkok street food vendors, but still affordable at 40 - 50 THB per dish usually.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

https://anastasiablogger.com/specialprice

Just a few quick facts before we dive into all the details: 

- So far, with Pinterest traffic I made a maximum of $250/ day from one of my blogs (using Mediavine ads);
- In my best monthly online income so far, I made over $8300 totally thanks to Pinterest traffic. 
- On my best traffic day, I‚Äôve got over 13,000 users on one of my blogs (it was of course a viral pin).
- My best monthly traffic on one of my blogs exceeded 300,000 pageviews.

These are some numbers which give you a quick idea about the importance of Pinterest traffic for my online income. And now, let‚Äôs look at the details‚Ä¶ 
These are the main ways Pinterest helps me make money with my blogs:
- Advertising (I use Mediavine company);
- Affiliate marketing in the articles and posts which get traffic mainly from Pinterest;
- Selling my products (printables and courses). 

Users on Pinterest can be in two modes:
‚Ä¢ Active search;
‚Ä¢ Explore by scrolling the Smartfeed.

Both ways you can get users who are genuinely interested in your topic. But if they come from search results, even more so. That‚Äôs definitely a positive thing about Pinterest audience compared to social media like Facebook or Instagram.

Luckily, Pinterest is a hybrid of a search engine and a social platform which makes our goals more achievable even without an ad budget if you know what you are doing with your Pinterest SEO.

- By 2020, they have finished the construction of the tallest structure in the world. The top of Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia is towering above the planet at a height of 3,281 ft (1 km).
- Scrolls, which are, in fact, groundbreaking screens that you can roll up, have replaced good old solid tablets. The ultra-thin digital displays can reproduce video, images, and text, and let you browse the Internet. 
- Self-cleaning buildings have appeared, which also fight smog and air pollution. They are coated with titanium dioxide that, when heated by sunlight, releases free radicals and breaks the grime down. Then everything gets washed away in the rain. 
- By 2020-2021, the first space hotel has opened its doors for the first visitors. No wait that‚Äôs a bad idea.  They all get sucked out into the vacuum.  How about we open ""airlocks"" for them instead?) Either way, to see our planet from space, you still have to fork over about $9.5 million for a 12-day trip. 
- By 2028, it's become impossible to live in Venice, Italy. While the town is not entirely underwater, the water level is so high that people have deserted their houses. So, if you haven't visited Venice yet, hurry up!
-  By 2030, the Arctic ice sheet has significantly decreased in size. What's more, all the ice in the Arctic Ocean melts during the summer. 
- In 2033, a manned mission sets off for Mars. As for the whole space exploration program, also called the Aurora program, it's going to concentrate on exploring the Moon, Mars, and nearby asteroids. 
- Supersonic jets running on fuel made of a special air mixture have appeared. That's why these days, you need 2 hours at most to get from London to New York.
- If your usual order is a cup of decaf coffee, you're in for a pleasant surprise: by 2030, farmers have started to grow caffeine-free coffee beans. 
- There are tiny sensors all over your body. Thanks to them, doctors can monitor your vitals round the clock.
- Due to the wide use of artificial implants, such as bionic eyes, synthetic blood, or ears with enhanced hearing, a lot of humans have become more non-biological than biological. 
- Lots of Winter Olympic sites have become unsuitable for holding the event. There are no regular snowfalls, so many winter sports have been moved indoors. 
- Many languages have died out, and the total number has dropped from about 7,000 to less than half of this figure.   
- On the bright side, the average person works less than 20 hours per week!

Coronavirus: Australian anti-lockdown suspect's arrest draws controversy - BBC News,"The arrest of a woman in Australia for promoting an anti-lockdown protest online has drawn criticism, after video of the incident went viral.

Footage shows officers handcuffing pregnant woman Zoe-Lee Buhler, 28, in her home in Victoria on Wednesday in front of her partner and children.

She starts crying during the arrest, telling police: ""I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong.""
Authorities have defended the officers, saying they acted appropriately.
Victoria has been in lockdown since July to curb a coronavirus outbreak that has fuelled Australia's second wave.

Authorities have imposed stay-at-home rules and a curfew in Melbourne, the state capital. The lockdown has closed many businesses and banned gatherings around the state.
Many people support the measures but others oppose them, and they have been targeted by a fringe anti-lockdown movement.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Notre-Dame fire: Millions pledged to rebuild cathedral - BBC News,"Notre-Dame cathedral fire: Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame after a devastating fire partially destroyed the French cathedral.

The fire, declared fully extinguished some 15 hours after it began, ravaged the 850-year-old building's roof and caused its spire to collapse.

But firefighters who worked through the night managed to save the Paris landmark's main stone structure, including its two towers.
The cause of the fire is not yet clear.

Paris public prosecutor R√©my Heitz said his office was ""favouring the theory of an accident"", but had assigned 50 people to work on what he believed would be a ""long"" and ""complex"" investigation.
Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

Covid restrictions: PM sets out new hospitality and face covering rules - BBC News,"The UK has reached ""a perilous turning point"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, as he set out a raft of new coronavirus restrictions for England which could last for up to six months.

Shop staff will have to wear face masks and weddings will be limited to a maximum of 15 people, under new rules.

Penalties for breaking laws on gatherings, wearing masks and for businesses will increase.

He also warned ""significantly greater restrictions"" could come if necessary.

Following a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee this morning with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said ""similar steps"" would be taken across the UK.

""We always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. I'm sorry to say that, as in Spain and France and many other countries, we've reached a perilous turning point,"" he said.

Mr Johnson told the House of Commons he would provide police and local authorities with extra funding to enforce the regulations and the option to draw on military support.

Surf Mesa - Somewhere ((Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2021) ft. Gus Dapperton,"Surf Mesa - Somewhere ft. Gus Dapperton. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Powell Aguirre has a great imagination - you can hear it in his music. So the up ‚Äòn‚Äô coming producer, reppin‚Äô Seattle via LA, presents himself as Surf Mesa. Relatively unknown until last year, the 20-year-old caught a monster wave with a sample of singer Emilee Flood‚Äôs cover of Franki Valli's‚Äô ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Take My Eyes Off You.‚Äù This July, ‚Äúily (i love you baby)‚Äù became RIAA-certified gold behind the song's breezy familiarity; it quickly became ubiquitous on TikTok. Surf has used this popularity to become even more inventive. Recent highlights include remixes for both Halsey and Marshmello. The college dropout recently delivered his first post-‚Äúily‚Äù track. Featuring Gus Dapperton on vocals, ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù glides along on ethereal synths and drum-machine fills - it‚Äôs rich and full of feeling. The young producer has quickly leapt from what he calls the ‚Äúbudget EDM‚Äù of his Soundcloud days. Because he doesn‚Äôt sing, his Artists To Watch performances required some special guests. Gus kindly joined for ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù and a pair of violinists and vocalists (singers Melissa McMillan and Miranda Joan, and instrumentalists Francesca Dardani and Tia Allen) surrounded him for ‚Äúily.‚Äù Be sure to watch ‚Äòem both. Each has plenty of liftoff.

Migrants reach Spain's Ceuta enclave in record numbers ‚Äì BBC News,"At least 6,000 migrants have reached Spain's Ceuta enclave from neighbouring Morocco, a record number over a single day, Spanish officials say.

They say the migrants - who include about 1,500 minors - either swam around the border fences that jut out into the sea or walked across at low tide.
They are said to be mostly from Morocco. Spain says it has already sent some 2,700 back - but not the minors.

Spanish troops have been deployed to the beach to help border police at Ceuta's main entry point - Tarajal, on the enclave's south side.

Kazakhstan's Crypto-Boom? - BBC News,"Despite their volatility, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have exploded in popularity in the past year with interest and investments from people skyrocketing.
 But no place on earth has seen results quite like Kazakhstan, which in the space of just six months has become a world leader in Bitcoin mining. 

The central Asian country is so important to the digital currency that the global Bitcoin network was badly impacted when violent protests hit the country earlier this month. And although the government initially welcomed crypto miners, they‚Äôve now trying to reign in this burgeoning industry. 

BBC's  Cyber Reporter Joe Tidy has this report from Kazakhstan where he visited one of the largest mines in the world.

LYRICS:
Cause I've got some good news
People all around the world
I‚Äôll share it with you
It's like nothing that you've ever heard
Its gonna change your heart and mind
Whenever hope gets hard to find
You can stand upon the solid gospel truth
I've got some good news
 
Sometimes I wonder what went wrong
Like brother Marvin said, what's‚Äô going on
How long, Lord, must we sing this song?
Hold on, hold on
 
God is good and He sent His son
Gave his life for everyone
Rose again and rolled away the stone
That ain't how the story ends
God still loves the world my friends
He‚Äôs coming back again to take us home
I've got some good news
I've got some good news

20 CRAZY IDEAS TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS,"Amazing hacks and pranks that your friends will love

It‚Äôs time to have a laugh with our friends, I mean they are the best people to have fun with. So, why not mess with them a bit? 
You can prank them and make them believe you have pimples, by applying some red eyeshadow to your face, then add a blob of eyelash glue, and when it dried sprinkle some yellow eyeshadow. 
Another trick to try is to make it look like you‚Äôre are a super old person by putting some non-toxic PVA glue on your face. When it dries the glue will automatically wrinkle your face. For an extra step, you can apply some baby powder on your hair too. 
Of course, pranking is another way to have some fun with friends. You can tease them until they start chasing you around the house. But what they won‚Äôt know is that they‚Äôll bump into a clingfilm that‚Äôs spread across two doors and they‚Äôll ruin their makeup.
Watch until the end to see how to make frozen cereal for your friends and how to prank them with a carton of milk and some water. 

Timestamps: 
0:24 ‚Äì Fake braces prank
1:42 ‚Äì Hilarious pranks to try on your friends

Cuba sees biggest protests against Communist government in decades - BBC News,"Thousands of Cubans have joined the biggest protests for decades against the island's Communist government.

Images on social media showed what appear to be security forces detaining and beating some of the protesters. Cubans have been angered by the collapse of the economy, as well as by restrictions on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the pandemic.

Thousands of pro-government supporters also took to the streets after the president went on television to urge them to defend the revolution - referring to the 1959 uprising which ushered in decades of Communist rule.

Coolant Pump Replaced on ISS on This Week @NASA1,"Outside the International Space Station, Expedition 35 Flight Engineers Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn of NASA conducted a 5-hour, 30-minute spacewalk on the station's P6 truss to replace a suspect pump controller box which distributes coolant to the station's thermal control system. The quick-turnaround spacewalk was mounted just 48 hours after an ammonia coolant leak developed on P6.  After installing the spare pump, power was turned on, and the system appeared to be working properly with no indications of ammonia leaking from the pump.

Israeli settlers burn Palestinian West Bank village in mass attack | BBC News,"At least one Palestinian was been killed after dozens of armed Israeli settlers, some wearing masks, attacked a village in the occupied West Bank, setting fire to houses and cars. 

The settlers threw rocks and Molotov cocktails in the village of Jit, according to the  Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

The Palestinian health ministry said Rashid Sedda, 22, was killed by gunfire from the settlers and another man was seriously wounded in what it condemned as an act of ‚Äúorganised state terrorism‚Äù. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of a fatality.  Israel‚Äôs prime minister said that he viewed the incident with ‚Äúutmost severity‚Äù.

It is the latest in the series of attacks by extremist settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where there has been a spike in violence since Hamas‚Äôs deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza.

Around 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews have been built since Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Hong Kong Tiananmen: ‚ÄòWe may never mark the crackdown again‚Äô - BBC News,"Hong Kong‚Äôs annual candlelight vigil commemorating those who were killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown has been banned by authorities because of Covi-19 public health concerns.

Some fear the vigil may become a thing of the past in the future as China prepares a national security law for Hong Kong.

Hong Kong authorities deny the law is designed to restrict the freedoms seen in the semi-autonomous city.

Two women explain why they are streaming online for free a play they wrote and produced about the 1989 crackdown.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Welcome to Davao City, the biggest city in Mindanao and one of the most unique cities in the Philippines if you love food! Today we‚Äôll be going on an ultimate Filipino street food tour to eat at 5 of the best spots in Davao City! Get ready for some unforgettable food!

Friends in the video: 
‚ñ∫ Chui: @TheChuiShow 
‚ñ∫ Dianne: https://www.facebook.com/DavaoFoodGuidePH 

1. Bull's Eye Sandawa - Hidden in a back alley in a neighborhood, our first stop on the Philippines street food tour in Davao is a spot that specializes in bullseye, and yes it really means that. Bullseye - 120 PHP ($2.05 US) 

2. Sana's Kabawan & Bulaloan - Probably the most legendary food stall eatery in Davao City, Sana's Kabawan & Bulaloan is famously known for being the favorite of Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines. They are known for their Buffalo tapa and bulalo. Price - 1,340 PHP ($22.91 US) for everything 

3. Luz Kinilaw Inihaw Place - Next up, another legendary Davao restaurant, and this time for Kinilaw - raw fish, and other parts of the tuna. If you love seafood, this place is amazing, and I loved the kinilaw! Price - 1,740 PHP ($29.74 US) for everything 

4. Paz Eatery Davao - We‚Äôre continuing with our Filipino street food tour at another place legendary for being open 24 hours a day and specializing in Balbacua - Cow foot soup and Lechon kawali - fried pork belly. Price - 360 PHP ($6.15 US) for everything 

5. Bulcachong - Another famous spot you have to try in Davao City, with a bull logo, and they specialize in a thick beef stew. Price - 220 PHP ($3.76 US) per bowl 

BONUS: Uncle Tito‚Äôs Durian - Finally, there was no way I was going to leave Davao City without trying their most famous food - durian!! We tried 6 different varieties - Se√±orita, Davao selection, Arancillo, Malaysia native, Kob, Puyat - and Arancillo was the best! 

Davao City is action packed, people are friendly, and it‚Äôs one of the best places in the Philippines to eat. I hope this video will give you some great suggestions about the best Filipino food and durian in Mindanao!

LYRICS
I entertain thoughts about you
I keep them happy yeah, canap√©s
My pupils are so dilated
I can‚Äôt focus anymore

But I don‚Äôt need to cause
When I am with you
So close up You‚Äôre my fixation 
It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know if its
Right
I‚Äôve got to tell you
Confession
Cause there‚Äôs
This pressure
On me

(I want)

I‚Äôve got no defence against you
Look at how I resonate
My intentions all betray me
I can‚Äôt do this anymore 

But I don‚Äôt need to cause
When I am with you
So close up You‚Äôre my fixation 
It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know if its
Right
I‚Äôve got to tell you
Confession
Cause there‚Äôs
This pressure
On me

I want to know
If you
Think we could be more than friends
If you heard my confession
If your feelings don‚Äôt mirror mine
Or if I‚Äôm right

Now that you‚Äôre so close
I‚Äôve got to tell you that
I‚Äôve got a confession

Lyrics:
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in... again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

"If You Spend Hours on a Computer, These Tricks Are a Must","According to experts, rapid fatigue and pain in muscles and joints is 75% caused by the wrong posture at the computer and only 25% by the failure to respect the balance between work and rest. Bad habits of poor posture are a common cause for lower and upper back pain. Let‚Äôs search how you can make sitting before the PC easier on the body. Don‚Äôt worry, mastering a good posture doesn‚Äôt have to take a lot of time. In fact, it‚Äôs often just about being aware of your posture and making sure you don‚Äôt slouch in a chair or hunch your back when looking at your phone.

That would be easier to do if you buy a special office or gaming armchair. They have anatomical shape, and they can be adjusted to fit your frame perfectly. If you don‚Äôt feel like buying an expensive chair, at least get some lower back support. It can be a seat cushion or a chair back attachment that will hold your back in a natural position, so you won‚Äôt get up sore. Your eyes will get sore much less often if there‚Äôs no glare on the screen. Turn your monitor away from all sources of light, especially the sun. So, guys, if you sit on your laptop all day long, here are some really useful tips that can help you feel better.

Sabarimala: Women who defied temple mobs 'have no fear' - BBC News,"Two women who defied protesters to enter one of Hinduism's holiest temples say they have no fear of mobs enraged by their actions.

Kanaka Durga, 39, and Bindu Ammini, 40, made history by entering Sabarimala shrine in India's Kerala state on Wednesday, sparking protests.

The women told the BBC they felt it necessary to uphold women's rights.

In September the Indian Supreme Court said the temple's ban against women of menstruating age was discriminatory.

Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating at the time.

Some protesters argue that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayappa, and reacted angrily.

#Lebanon: How we prepare staff for treating severely injured patients,"At Al Hamshari Hospital in Lebanon, our teams are providing essential trainings so that doctors and nurses are better prepared to treat severely injured patients arriving to the emergency room.  

In collaboration with other partners, our teams have conducted similar trainings in 10 different hospitals across Lebanon with over 400 staff members since October 2023. 

Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been exchanging fire across the border between southern Lebanon and northern Israel. The violence escalated dramatically when Israel launched coordinated pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon on September 18 and 19, before launching a full-scale military assault on September 23. To date, more than 2,000 people have been killed and about 10,000 wounded.

28 Top Secret SPY Hacks You Need To Know,"Unbelievable tricks spy use that nobody knows about

Spies use all sorts of hacks when they need to go undercover. And in this video, I show you some of their best hacks that will inspire you to become a spy. 
One of them is when they get into a plastic bag and pretend, they‚Äôre trash on the side of the road to go undercover. 
Another fun trick to try is placing a mirror next to someone and see what they‚Äôre doing on their phone. 
If someone tries to grab your phone, remove your fingerprints, and add your toes as a way to unlock your phone. 
To keep all your valuables safe, add a wooden board at the base of your chair, and then seal it on top with a chair cushion. In that space you‚Äôve created, hide all your valuables. 
If you wanna check whether your room has hidden cameras or not, take a camera around a room to scan for the camera lens.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Sofia Camara - Starlight (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Sofia Camara - Starlight | An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

A relationship ruptures under a relentless flood of passion in Sofia Camara‚Äôs outstanding power ballad ""Who Do I Call Now? (Hellbent).‚Äù A lover has walked out the door. Tears have been shed. And although she‚Äôs surrounded by broken dishes and glasses, the narrator would trade the silence and loneliness for their (seemingly toxic) partner to come back. Only 22-year-old, it‚Äôs surprising and impressive that the Toronto-raised, Portugal-born newcomer weaves the contradictions of the soul into her music with such a deft touch. During breaks between DSCVR performances, she described her bond with music as ‚Äúa healing thing,‚Äù and how she wants the relationship with her songs and their listeners to be a two way street. ‚ÄúI hope it heals a part of them the way it kind of healed a part of me.‚Äù With more than 10 million Spotify streams, Camara‚Äôs foundational track has certainly mended the hearts of many. That her musical spark came from a school project on Adele makes even more sense when you spin through ‚ÄúDo You Love Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúNever Be Yours.‚Äù The first simmers in a downtempo pop broth, the second rocks n‚Äô rolls a bit. Both are a one way trip to an emotional coliseum, where love and resentment and longing battle it out. This earnest vigor is rare, and we expect to see the powerhouse vocalist tearing up stages for quite a long time - starting right here.

What If You Stayed In Your Bed for a Year,"What Would Happen If You Never Left Your Bed? Most of us find it really hard waking up for school or work due to different reasons. But what if you actually decided to never get out of bed? Well, given the horrible effects it would have on your physical and mental health, you‚Äôd quickly regret your decision. 


You‚Äôd get bedsores 0:48
Just imagine: all your muscles, fatty tissue, blood vessels, and skin get squeezed between the mattress and the weight of your body. This pressure cuts off blood supply to your soft tissues, starving your cells of much-needed nutrients carried by the blood. As a result, these tissues eventually die, especially in the areas of the body under the greatest amount of pressure. Bedsores are most likely to appear around the knees, elbows, shoulder blades, heels, ankles, and tailbone. 

You‚Äôd suffer from muscular atrophy and decreased bone density 2:31
As time goes by and your bedsores keep getting worse and worse, you can also expect to feel weaker and weaker. After a month, your muscle mass will be cut down by 50 percent. As a result of atrophied muscles, your coordination and balance will actually get worse. Just like your muscles, your bones aren‚Äôt getting any use either.

You‚Äôd experience cardiovascular problems 4:11 
After just a couple of days in bed, blood will start to pool in your legs. Your heart, in an attempt to get that blood moving, will start beating more quickly. Fatigue will set in extremely fast, and your stamina will drop significantly. Your blood itself will become thick and sticky.

You‚Äôd increase your risk of getting pneumonia 4:52
Your muscles won‚Äôt be working to remove excess liquids from your body, so fluid will start accumulating in the lungs. And since you‚Äôre lying flat on your back in a bed, your lungs won‚Äôt be able to fully expand and fill with air. This decreased lung volume means your breathing will get more and more shallow, and the exchange of oxygen with carbon dioxide in your lungs will worsen.

NASA experiment 6:08
Drew Iwanicki took part in one of NASA studies and spent 70 days in bed. When the experiment was over and he tried to stand, his legs felt incredibly heavy, and his heart reached top ‚Äúspeeds‚Äù of 150 beats per minute. He was starting to go through psychological changes. He didn‚Äôt talk his friends or family as much simply because he had no news to share. He also felt anxious and afraid of the upcoming weeks.

SUMMARY
-Bedsores are most likely to appear around the knees, elbows, shoulder blades, heels, ankles, and tailbone. 
-Unused muscles start to lose from 20 to 30 percent of their strength after just one week of bed rest.
-After some time, your bones will be left with just 40 to 70 percent of their initial mass. The bones in your legs are especially vulnerable to this disintegration.
-The cartilage around your joints starts to deteriorate, leading to limited joint movement.
-Your circulation and blood volume will still decrease dramatically. With less blood in your body, your organs will get less oxygen.
-Your muscles won‚Äôt be working to remove excess liquids from your body, so fluid will start accumulating in the lungs. 
-A long period of immobility will lead to both hormonal changes in your body as well as a mineral imbalance. And since you‚Äôre not moving and burning calories, you can expect to see more body fat building.
-Prolonged bed rest often leads to cognitive and mental problems, from confusion, irritability, and insomnia to apathy, depression and panic attacks. 
-Drew Iwanicki spent 70 days in bed and could hardly stand up when the experiment was over.

Germany resumes Afghan deportations after mass stabbing | BBC News,"Germany says it has carried out its first deportation of convicted Afghan offenders since the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan three years ago, a week after three people were fatally stabbed at a street festival in the western town of Solingen.

The killings shocked Germany and sparked an intense debate over asylum rules when it emerged the main suspect was a 26-year-old Syrian refugee facing deportation. An Afghan man was detained after another deadly attack in May.

The government in Berlin has already announced a series of measures ahead of elections on Sunday in eastern Germany, where the far-right Alternative for Germany is riding high in the polls.

Cautious Clay - Stolen Moments (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"Cautious Clay - Stolen Moments - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

There‚Äôs power in the name Cautious Clay. Aside from the sly reference to a certain legendary boxer, Joshua Karpeh chose the moniker with on-brand thoughtfulness: ‚ÄúCautious‚Äù reflects Karpeh‚Äôs production style. Particular. Detailed. The 26-year-old began deftly shaping ephemeral soundscapes more than half-a-decade ago, originally posting his beats to SoundCloud. In 2015, his ‚ÄúOcean Eyes‚Äù remix caught the attention of the song‚Äôs original writer: Billie Eilish. With both artists taking early strides to their current success, Eilish‚Äôs inclusion of Cautious‚Äô cover in an official remix package was a major moment for the young studio whiz. ‚ÄúAt the time, I was thinking more in the production mindset, but I quickly learned how to write songs,‚Äù he told Billboard. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had a strong sense of words, but I never really merged those two worlds together.‚Äù Born in Cleveland and raised by his mother on Earth Wind & Fire, Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake and ‚Äúa bunch of other folky shit,‚Äù he moved to Brooklyn in the summer of 2016, snagging a job in real estate to pay the bills. In this new world, Cautious found his literal voice - a raspy, soulful croon. He quit his day job a year later to focus solely on his music career. Singles trickled online - most notably ‚ÄúCold War,‚Äù a pulsating eulogy to modern dating - which culminated in Blood Type, a standout debut EP that insightfully tackled identity. These days Cautious is invigorated, ready to take a few chances. Earlier this year, he slid into John Mayer‚Äôs DMs, leading to not one but two collabs with the iconic guitar player. And when Taylor Swift‚Äôs team hit him up for clearance to interpolate ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù on her Lover track ‚ÄúLondon Boy,‚Äù he trusted his gut and acquiesced. In between all the action, a follow up EP, Table of Context, dropped early this year, along with a string of tour dates in across Europe and the US. Backed by a three-piece band, Cautious‚Äô Artists To Watch session provides viewers a chance to hear unique iterations of fan-favorite ‚ÄúStolen Moments‚Äù and a newbie with a super-tight groove and fuzzy guitar hues, ‚ÄúErase.‚Äù Come for the sax solo, stay for the flute outro.

USEFUL GADGETS AND HACKS FOR PET OWNERS,"Hello, smart pet owners! We prepared a huge portion of different gadgets, hacks, and cool crafts. If your doggy hates water and after-walk showers, here‚Äôs a trick to make this process easier. Stick a Pop It fidget to the wall in the bathroom and fill it with small snacks. While your pet is eating treats, you can easily wash your dog and not worry that they will run away. 
When you go out, never forget to take a small water dispenser for your pets, they also want to drink more during summertime! You will also see a great device here to help you clean up after your dog when you two go out. 
Want to take a selfie with your pet? Cut your old earphones‚Äô wire and place your pet‚Äôs favorite toy there instead of them ;) This hack will definitely work! You will attract your dog‚Äôs or cat‚Äôs attention and take lots of lovely pictures!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKF7jjnYQig

LYRICS
¬°La Revoluci√≥n!
W, Y
(Definitivamente eres la mujer de mis sue√±os)
 
No puedo ya disimular (no, no)
Te toco y empiezo a temblar (eeeh, qu√≠tate la ropa)
Empiezas t√∫ a desnudarte (estamos envuelto)
Me miras y me pides m√°s (eh eh)
Sudados los dos (eh)
Perd√≠ el control (eh eh, t√∫ sabes ya)
Me entrego y solo s√© (eeeh, Doble U)
 
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Yo solo s√©
 
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Mi mente analiza y me dice que
 
Una locura sentir tu cuerpo, besar tu boca
Sentir tu piel y cuando me tocas (am√°ndonos)
Haci√©ndonos uno los dos (aj√°)
Sigo sintiendo ese cosquilleo
Y cuando te miro a la cara veo que est√° gust√°ndole
Est√° disfrut√°ndolo y me pide m√°s (heeeh)
No hay medicina que pueda a m√≠ curarme (no, no)
S√≥lo la que t√∫ me das (plah plah)
Si no me das de lo tuyo
Empiezo a desesperarme (no, no)
Y me pide m√°s
 
No puedo ya disimular (no, no)
Te toco y empiezo a temblar, eh eeeh
Y empiezas t√∫ a desnudarte (hah)
Me miras y me pides m√°s (sh sh plah, eh eh)
Sudados los dos (eh)
Perd√≠ el control (eh)
Me entrego y solo s√© (eeeh, hey)
 
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Yo s√≥lo s√©
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
 
Ella se siente muy excitada y (Doble U)
Me toca alocada
Pone en el suelo la copa
Sin darno' cuenta nos quitamos la ropa
Sensual, con pasi√≥n me arropa (heh heh)
Por encima de mi cuerpo galopa (Doble U)
Y calor, cambiando de color
Sobeteo con ella y el juego est√° a su favor (amor)
Yo fui el primero que encontr√© el sensor
El maquillaje y el corrector se borran por el sudor
Y as√≠ mismo (aj√°)
Echa pa' fuera tu erotismo
Me encanta cuando te desvisto
Tiene magia (tiene magia)
Utiliza el mecanismo
No puedo contigo, mami ya yo no resisto (Yandel)
 
No hay medicina que pueda a m√≠ curarme (no, no)
Solo la que t√∫ me das
Si no me das de lo tuyo
Empiezo a desesperarme (no, no)
Y me pide m√°s (tah tah, tah tah)
 
No hay medicina que pueda a m√≠ curarme (no, no)
Solo la que t√∫ me das (aj√°)
Si no me das de lo tuyo
Empiezo a desesperarme (no, no, Doble, Doble, Doble)
Y me pide m√°s
 
No puedo ya disimular (no, no)
Te toco y empiezo a temblar, eeeh (qu√≠tate la ropa)
Empiezas t√∫ a desnudarte (estamos envueltos)
Me miras y me pides m√°s (heeeh, eh eh)
Sudados los dos (eh)
Perd√≠ el control (eh eh, t√∫ sabes ya)
Me entrego y solo s√© (eeeh, Doble U)
 
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Yo solo s√©
 
Que te siento
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (Yandel, oh oh oh)
Mi mente analiza y me dice que
 
Soy bendecido y afortunado
Al tener a alguien como t√∫ a mi lado

SUMMARY:
- There‚Äôs something about writing down your to-do list that seems to equal a homerun. But you have to be specific about it!
- Another great way to stimulate the ol‚Äô thinker is with books. They develop your vocabulary, imagination, and even problem-solving skills. 
- Rich people know how to earn someone‚Äôs trust, convince others, and avoid being manipulated. They stand up straight, maintain eye contact, and overall ooze confidence. 
- Seems random, I know, but there‚Äôs a statistic out there that 80% of wealthy people call loved ones on their birthday. 
- Socializing with success-oriented individuals puts you in the right mindset, keeps you constantly striving to do better.
- In general, rich people spend 5 minutes listening for each minute they speak.
- Stress blocks your brain, and you‚Äôll need a clear sharp mind if you‚Äôre wanting to follow in the footsteps of the most successful people out there. Meditation can help clear up that mental fog!
- The successful folk eat less junk food and try to stay pretty active. 
- Truly successful people can say ‚Äúno‚Äù in any situation that calls for it. 
- A long, relaxing midday lunch allows you to refresh yourself and return to work ready to put in much more productive energy!
- They understand that risks lead to rewards, so they‚Äôre more willing to go out on a limb‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs where the sweetest fruit is! 
- Charity and philanthropy are hallmarks of the wealthy. 
- The truly successful understand that good relationships are a crucial foundation for financial well-being. Hurting or offending people can obviously sever those ties.
- Seems like a weird thought, but if you‚Äôre doing what you love, you won‚Äôt ever want to stop. So, yes, if you can make a living from your passion, then you‚Äôre without a doubt on the road to personal success!

QE2's Flyby on This Week @NASA,"As the 1.7-mile-long asteroid 1998 QE2 began its relatively close flyby of Earth, telescope images were provided during a live broadcast from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, seen on NASA Television and nasa.gov. Among the insight provided from asteroid experts at JPL and the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, which used radar to track and image the asteroid -- a discovery that QE2 has an orbiting moon about 600 meters wide. The program also featured NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, who discussed the agency's role in keeping the planet safe from asteroids and other Near Earth Objects. The May 31 QE2 fly-by -- some 3-point-6 million miles from Earth is asteroid's the closest approach to our planet for at least the next two centuries.

Lyrics:
This is not a performance
And I‚Äôm not checking boxes
I‚Äôm here to worship
I‚Äôm here to worship You
 
So dust off the cobwebs
And clear out my conscience
Cause I‚Äôm here to worship
I‚Äôm here to worship You
 
And nothing else
I‚Äôm here to worship You
And nothing else
I‚Äôm here to worship You
There‚Äôs no one else 
I‚Äôm here to worship You
That‚Äôs all I wanna do
 
Come and stoke up the furnace
Till my idols are ashes
Cause I‚Äôm here to worship
I‚Äôm here to worship You
 
Till there‚Äôs only one yearning
Till my lukewarm is burning
I‚Äôm here to worship 
I‚Äôm here to worship You 
 
And nothing else
I‚Äôm here to worship You
And nothing else
I‚Äôm here to worship You
There‚Äôs no one else 
I‚Äôm here to worship You
That‚Äôs all I wanna do
I‚Äôm here to worship You
 
Hallelujah 
Maranatha
Worthy is the lamb 
Glory, glory in the highest
The Beginning and the End
Hallelujah
Maranatha 
Holy is the Lord
With all the angels
And all of Heaven
Bowing down before You
 
Oh I lay it all down
I lay it all down
 
I give You my heart
I give You my heart again

Sri Lanka seeks way forward after president quits - BBC News,"Sri Lanka is seeking a way out of political and economic chaos after its President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned and fled the country and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed temporary leader. 

After being sworn in as interim leader, Mr Wickremesinghe promised to act quickly to put a democratically elected president in place.

Given the governing party has a majority, MPs are thought likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe, who has close links with the Rajapaksa family.

But whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter, because Mr Wickremesinghe's resignation as PM was a key demand of protesters.

Germany starts Christmas lockdown amid Covid surge - BBC News,"Germany will enter a hard lockdown over the Christmas period, as the number of deaths and infections from the virus has surged in recent weeks.

Non-essential shops and schools will close nationwide during the lockdown, which will last from 16 December to 10 January.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed Christmas shopping for a ""considerable"" rise in social contacts.

A maximum of five people from no more than two households are currently allowed to gather in a home. But this limit will be relaxed from 24 to 26 December, when one household will be able to host a maximum of four close family members from other households.

Children aged under 14 are not included in this limit.

Germany's lockdown measures:
From Wednesday, schools and non-essential shops will close
People must, where possible, work from home
Private gatherings will be limited to a maximum of five people from two households - with an additional four close family members allowed over Christmas
Some German states are going further with night-time curfews and a ban on going out for anything other than essential reasons imposed in some areas
There'll be no let-up over New Year either. No gatherings on the streets will be allowed, and the sale of fireworks is prohibited - many Germans like to celebrate Silvester, as it's called here, with a bang.",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1B0ylZWqM

Syria is ‚Äúnot a threat to the world‚Äù its new Islamist leader tells BBC | BBC News,"The leader of the most powerful group in control of Syria has told the BBC that the country is exhausted by war and is no threat to its neighbours or the West.  In an interview in Damascus, Ahmed al-Sharaa told the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen that sanctions on Syria should be lifted.

Sharaa led the lightning offensive that toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime less than two weeks ago. He is the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the most powerful group in the rebel alliance.  He was previously known by his wartime name, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani.

Sharaa  said HTS should be de-listed as a terrorist organisation. It is designated as one by the UN, US, and EU, among many others, as it started as a splinter group of al-Qaeda, which it broke away from in 2016. 

Sharaa said HTS was not a terrorist group. He said they did not target civilians and considered themselves to be victim of the crimes of the Assad regime. The victims, he said, should not be treated the same way as the oppressors. He denied that he wanted to establish a regime like the Taliban in  Afghanistan.  Sharaa said the countries had very different traditions. Afghanistan was a tribal society. In Syria, he said, there was a different mindset. 

He said he believed in education for women and referred to the high number of women attending university in parts of Syria. 

Sharaa was relaxed throughout the interview, wearing civilian clothes, and tried to offer reassurance to all those who believe his group has not broken with its extremist past.   However many Syrians do not believe him and fear that a hardline Islamist government will emerge.

Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jeremy Bowen in the Syrian capital Damascus.

Danish PM reacts to Trump's cancellation of Denmark visit - BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has cancelled a state visit to Denmark after the nation's prime minister said Greenland was not for sale to the US.

The president was scheduled to visit on 2 September, at the invitation of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II.

Sydney rains: Record rainfall brings flooding but puts out mega-blaze - BBC News,"Sydney has been hit by its heaviest rain in 30 years, bringing widespread flooding but also putting out two massive bushfires in New South Wales.

Australia's weather agency said 391.6mm of rain had fallen in the past four days in Sydney, more than three times the average rainfall for February.

About 100,000 homes are without power, and officials have warned flash floods could be life-threatening.

But the rainfall means only 17 fires are still burning across the state.

Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love.

Brumadinho dam collapse: A disaster waiting to happen?  - BBC News,"On 25 January 2019, a dam at an iron ore mine in Brumadinho collapsed. It caused a huge landslide that buried everything in its path.
More than 300 people were killed or are still missing.

Vale ‚Äì which owns the mine - is the world‚Äôs biggest producer of iron ore. It was the second mining disaster in the region since 2015, when a nearby dam co-owned by Vale also collapsed. Vale says the Brumadinho dam was assessed as safe by inspections over the years.

Newsnight‚Äôs Gabriel Gatehouse went to Brazil in March, as bodies were still being pulled from the mud. He found a story not just about an industrial accident, but about a system of economic development and a way of life built upon the ever increasing extraction of finite natural resources.

Pristine coral reef discovered off the coast of Tahiti - BBC News,"Marine explorers have discovered a giant coral reef at depths of 30m off the coast of Tahiti, French Polynesia.

The structure stretches over 3km along the sea bed and is one of the largest discovered at that depth, says the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which led the mission.

Dr Julian Barbiere, from Unesco, said there were probably many more of these ecosystems ""we just don't know about"".
""We should be working to map them and to protect them,"" he said.

TAIPEI, TAIWAN - Taiwan is extremely famous for their night market street food culture, and so tonight we‚Äôre eating our way through Nanjichang Night Market (ÂçóÊ©üÂ†¥Â§úÂ∏Ç) - a lesser known, yet extremely popular local night market. If you want an off the beaten path, guaranteed delicious Taiwanese food experience, this is a great Taipei night market to visit.

One of the greatest things about Nanjichang Night Market (ÂçóÊ©üÂ†¥Â§úÂ∏Ç) is that it‚Äôs not only a night market, but it‚Äôs open throughout the day and you‚Äôll find different food available depending on the time of the day. Additionally, about 3 or 4 different stalls at this market have been featured in the Michelin Guide Taiwan.

Here‚Äôs everything I ate:

Sticky Rice Restaurant ÊõâËø™Á≠í‰ªîÁ±≥Á≥ï: https://goo.gl/maps/sPHDpyumST9ZKZeYA

"Rocking out, Saudi-style - BBC News","Change is coming to Saudi Arabia. The world's biggest oil producer wants to be less dependent on one commodity, and boost its private sector. The country's 31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, says he also wants to start opening up the conservative kingdom, where cinemas are banned and women still aren't allowed to drive. How much? Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is in Saudi Arabia.

Deserter reveals secrets of top-secret Russian nuclear base | BBC News,"A former officer at a top-secret Russian nuclear weapons facility has revealed the secrets of life at the base after deserting from the country.
 
Anton, not his real name, said the nuclear weapons base he was serving at was put on full combat alert on the day of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
 
He also rejected the view that Russia‚Äôs nuclear weapons mostly date from the Soviet era and might not work; saying they are fully operational and battle-ready.
 
The BBC is unable to independently verify all the events he described, although they do correspond with Russian statements at the time.

EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-off - BBC News,"The European Commission has urged countries across the bloc to cut their gas use by 15% from August to March amid fears Russia could halt supplies, saying the target is voluntary but will become legally binding if Moscow turns off the taps this summer.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine it has cut supplies to a number of countries which have rejected its demand for payment for gas in roubles, including Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland.

The key Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany has been offline for maintenance for 10 days and is due to be turned back on this Thursday, but there are concerns Moscow will not follow through on its promise.

End Sars protest: Nigeria police to free all protesters - BBC News,"Nigeria's police chief has ordered the unconditional release of all demonstrators arrested during protests against police brutality.

This was a key demand of protesters who have rallied against the hated Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) in major cities for seven days.

Amnesty International said that 10 people were killed in the protests.

Rallies have continued despite President Muhammadu Buhari announcing on Sunday the disbandment of Sars.

Protesters responded to that announcement with scepticism, saying they believed that Sars officers were still deployed.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Coronavirus Explained: How do I protect myself? - BBC News,"People should be washing their hands for 20 seconds to protect themselves from the virus known as Covid-19. That's according to Public Health England.

Lucy Hockings finds out what Covid-19 is, how it spreads and answers your questions about what action you should take at home, work and when travelling, in a BBC News Special.

Surf Mesa - ily (i love you baby) (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2021,"Surf Mesa - ily (i love you baby). An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Powell Aguirre has a great imagination - you can hear it in his music. So the up ‚Äòn‚Äô coming producer, reppin‚Äô Seattle via LA, presents himself as Surf Mesa. Relatively unknown until last year, the 20-year-old caught a monster wave with a sample of singer Emilee Flood‚Äôs cover of Franki Valli's‚Äô ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Take My Eyes Off You.‚Äù This July, ‚Äúily (i love you baby)‚Äù became RIAA-certified gold behind the song's breezy familiarity; it quickly became ubiquitous on TikTok. Surf has used this popularity to become even more inventive. Recent highlights include remixes for both Halsey and Marshmello. The college dropout recently delivered his first post-‚Äúily‚Äù track. Featuring Gus Dapperton on vocals, ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù glides along on ethereal synths and drum-machine fills - it‚Äôs rich and full of feeling. The young producer has quickly leapt from what he calls the ‚Äúbudget EDM‚Äù of his Soundcloud days. Because he doesn‚Äôt sing, his Artists To Watch performances required some special guests. Gus kindly joined for ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù and a pair of violinists and vocalists (singers Melissa McMillan and Miranda Joan, and instrumentalists Francesca Dardani and Tia Allen) surrounded him for ‚Äúily.‚Äù Be sure to watch ‚Äòem both. Each has plenty of liftoff.

Supermassive black hole in Milky Way pictured for first time - BBC News,"A supermassive black hole that lives at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, has been pictured for the very first time.

Known as Sagittarius A*, the object is a staggering four-million times the mass of our Sun.

For scale, the ring is roughly the size of Mercury's orbit around our star.

Fortunately, this monster is a long, long way away - some 26,000 light-years in the distance - so there's no possibility of us ever coming to any danger.

20 LIFE HACKS FOR CLUMSY PEOPLE,"HACKS FOR CLUMSY PEOPLE

Being clumsy can be a real curse if... you don't know any of these hacks! But I'm here to help you out guys!

Let's say you've accidentally hit insanely clean, therefore transparent glass door. If you hit it hard, which you did because you were in a hurry and paid zero attention. There's no way you can escape from getting a black eye. Good news is you can make it disappear pretty soon.

Cut a bundle of parsley, add some ice cubes and put it all in a handkerchief. Then apply to the damaged area.

And if you have trouble adding condiments, do the following. Collect some Tic Tac boxes for instance. And instead of throwing the whole box of salt or sugar into the bowl, sprinkle your meal neatly from a small box. It's awfully easy to use and store.

And next one is for my lovely sister! She drops her smartphone so often I wonder how it's still working. If you also have this problem check out this hack. Stick a holder ring to the back of your phone and attach a key chain or any chain that's comfortable for you to use. Voila! Now you don't have to worry anymore about your flying phone.

Coronavirus: UK hospital built in two weeks opens its doors - BBC News,"The first of the government's emergency field hospitals to treat coronavirus patients has opened in east London's ExCel centre.

The temporary NHS Nightingale Hospital is able to hold as many as 4,000 patients and will be staffed by NHS medics with help from the military.

Prince Charles paid tribute to staff as he opened the hospital via video link.

Similar hospitals are planned across the UK, including in Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, Harrogate and Bristol.

The ExCel exhibition space - usually used for large events such as Crufts and Comic Con - was transformed into a hospital in just nine days.

It is the first of several Nightingale Hospitals planned in England, with the latest announcement that two will be built at the University of the West of England in Bristol and the Harrogate Convention Centre.

Others are due to open at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre and Manchester's Central Complex.

Why Cruise Ships Are White,"When you hear the word ‚Äúship‚Äù, what color will it be in your imagination? Probably white. We‚Äôre used to seeing big white cruise ships. Is this color necessary or just fancy? Cars come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Yellow, green, purple, red ‚Äì you name it. There are absolutely no problems with color choice, giving you the option to paint your car any color you like. Then why do ships still all look the same? 

It turns out there are a lot of reasons for it, but not all of them are true. Some people say it‚Äôs because the white color is better for detection, both visual and on the radar too. They assume the white color reflects the radio signal much better than any other color. Which theories are true and which aren‚Äôt?

SUMMARY:
- Most small boats are whatever colors their owners want them to be. So one thing we already know here is that the white color isn‚Äôt some kind of rule from a mariner‚Äôs book or something. Big cruise ships are often navy-blue or even red in color. 
-  If you‚Äôve ever been in high seas that are also coincidentally called blue waters, you know that sometimes all you can see around you is blue. 
- The white color could possibly be helpful here to spot a decently sized ship, but clouds and reflections of light in the waves are also white. 
- Metal hulls are extremely good at reflecting radio signals, no matter what color they are. If the hull is made of fiberglass like a lot of yachts‚Äô hulls are, then they‚Äôll have some metal part in them to reflect the radar.
- That means that white has absolutely no impact on any kind of detection in the sea, so we can rule this reason out for good. 
- If you keep in mind how aggressive saltwater is, any paint could become a concern. For metal ships, it gets even worse because they have to deal with rust.
- Tanker staff learned one trick that helps with that, and it‚Äôs definitely not white paint. It‚Äôs red paint, obviously. This is why some ships keep their hull red under the waterline.
- The black color absorbs almost all the sunlight it catches; this color has no reflective abilities. Sunlight isn‚Äôt only bright, but it also transfers energy in the form of heat. The more light gets absorbed ‚Äì the more heating power it generates. 
- Red can reflect more light; up to 40% of it just bounces off and doesn‚Äôt produce heat. Grey is slightly better. It can deflect half of all light, so a grey hull will heat up two times slower than a black one.
- The white-colored ships would only absorb 20% of all the sunlight, so it won‚Äôt heat up as much. This immensely reduces the stress on air conditioning systems and works wonders for energy efficiency.

See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
Been tryna hide it
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (You got me)
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause

I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)

And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)

Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna menage I got a tricycle
All these bitches, flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me young Nicki chimney
Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany

Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I

Jaguar XE SV Project 8 vs. Mercedes-AMG GT 63 4MATIC+‚Äî2019 BDC Hot Lap Matchup,"For 2019 we‚Äôre changing things up. Why watch one hot lap when you can see two at once!? Jaguar decided to go a little nuts and build a 600hp, track-focused, crazy expensive, sedan with the single purpose of setting great lap times. In fact, Randy Pobst set the production sedan lap record around Laguna Seca in a preproduction Project 8. This time out, Pobst‚Äôs got a healthier, full-production 2019 spec car and he should go quicker. Bad news for Jaguar, AMG built an even more powerful (and expensive) four-door sports car, the 2019 GT 63 S. Which super sedan will turn the quickest lap?

""Be Alright (Remix)"" por Evan Craft, Sean Cook, Willy Gonzalez, KB, Sam Rivera

Todo va a estar bien
Everything will be alright
The whole world's in His hands
Your whole world's in His hands

In the darkness and the trials
He's faithful and He's true
The whole world's in His hands
Y todo va a estar bien

There‚Äôs been so many things that I just never said
Like all the things I‚Äôd think about when I‚Äôm bed
I never really liked to hear that I was wrong
Lost all my motivation never saw the sun
It‚Äôs been super cloudy
I‚Äôm used to the night
I Lost so many things
I Almost lost my sight
But it all changed when I found you
Decided to throw everything and run toward you

I‚Äôll never be by myself
I got you right by my side
I know you‚Äôll never leave me alone
You‚Äôre the writer I‚Äôm the poem

Todo va a estar bien
Everything will be alright
The whole world's in His hands
Your whole world's in His hands

In the darkness and the trials
He's faithful and He's true
The whole world's in His hands
Y todo va a estar bien

Lucy (Lucifer) gunning for the souls of the soldiers
on the narrow road lost some bro‚Äôs on the shoulder
I see it‚Äôs getting colder but I know what He told us

They gon hold you down but the crown gonna hold up
yes indeed
oh my melody is para Ti I will never leave
I don‚Äôt need to die for me to rest in peace the recipe
half a cup of living water fresca
sing Dios es fiel y cumple sus promesas jepa
let me see
Heaven lookin good on me
oh yea
turn my 2020 to Psalm 23

oh yea
I just wanna see you through the pain now
reign down
hide anything but you face now
face down I pray
your promise is a pain killa
Who put to shame all the shame that stained in us
I don‚Äôt want no fame
or no praise
less Your name‚Äôs in it
we gon be ok listen

Todo va a estar bien 
Everything will be all right
The whole world‚Äôs in His hands
Your whole world‚Äôs in His hands

In the darkness and the trials
He‚Äôs faithful and He is true
The whole world‚Äôs in His hands
Y todo va a estar bien

Everything will be all right
Todo va a estar bien 
Everything will be all right

He‚Äôs got the whole world in his hands 
He‚Äôs got the whole world in his hands 
He‚Äôs got the whole wide world in his hands 
Todo el mundo en su mano est√°
Todo el mundo en su mano est√° 
Todo el mundo en su mano est√°

23 BRILLIANT ART IDEAS FOR EVERYONE,"AMAZING ART TIPS AND TUTORIALS YOU‚ÄôLL ENJOY TRYING

Today I show you some fun and brilliant ways to get creative. You can use these ideas to decorate your home, have fun with your family, or even improve your art skills. 
You can create a beautiful couples painting by stepping in some paint, putting your canvas or paper sheet on the floor and start dancing on it. 
You can test your creativity and intelligence by placing multiple cubes on a flat surface and then using them to create a beautiful portrait from its shadow. 
Another great idea is to place some flowers (face down) on a piece of paper. Then, place a paper towel on top and using a hammer start smashing them. Their colors and shapes will transfer on your paper.
You can also use food coloring on nail polish to decorate your thick-peeled fruits such as bananas and oranges. Simply add a few drops on nail polish in a bowl filled with water, then mix them around a bit with a toothpick and then dip your fruits in.

What If You Flushed Toilets with Saltwater,"With fresh water being so hot an issue today, you would think people should save every drop of the precious liquid. But then you flush your toilet and realize you‚Äôve just spent several gallons of clear water only to get rid of your waste. Why can‚Äôt we use saltwater instead, for example? How‚Äôs that saving the planet?

We have literal oceans of the stuff, and we can barely find any use for it. Well, there‚Äôs a huge trouble with salty water in the sewage system. You see, salt is hard. If you simply send tons of water from the oceans into the plumbing and sewers, several things will happen quite soon...

How to reduce excess use of water 6:30

#ecology #brightside #oceans

SUMMARY:
- The modern sewage system works with the help of water that carries waste to the disposal plants. 
- Water is perfect for this kind of activity as it keeps the waste afloat and pushes it through the pipes.
- The sludge gets some special treatment to make it usable as a fertilizer. 
- The water above the sludge, in its turn, becomes rather clear to the eye, but don‚Äôt let that fool you: it has billions of microscopic dirt particles in it that only wait to infect you if you have a drink. 
- In any case, the water gets biologically purified and is almost ready to go back where it came from, meaning seas and oceans.
- The most popular method of finishing clean is treating the water with a disinfectant, such as chlorine.
- Another way to purify the water involves pushing it through a special treatment tank, or a humus tank, where even the tiniest particles and bacteria get stuck in the filtering matter, while the water freely runs onwards.
-  If you‚Äôve ever swum in the sea, you know that if you lick your skin, it‚Äôll be salty to taste. And if you leave it to dry in the sun, you‚Äôll also notice a thin smattering of white on your skin. 
- The same applies to almost any surface saltwater might touch. 
- The resulting wastewater will not be able to return to the oceans just like that, or be used for other purposes, for that matter.
- Bacteria spread in the water and munch on everything harmful they can find around. With saltwater, such a system won‚Äôt cut it.
- That doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt use sea water at all, though. We are, in fact, using it already, and have been for quite some time.
- here are several desalination plants sprinkled across the globe that work hard to convert sea water into fresh one. 
- The existing desalination method is not perfect, of course, but it‚Äôs proven its efficiency. You can even drink the water after it has been devoid of salt! 
- In rural areas and smaller towns where people live in their own homes, composting toilets are the best possible solution. They don‚Äôt need any water at all, collecting all you have to throw inside them with quiet dignity and then dumping it into the soil, making it richer.

Master Peace - Boyfriend (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Master Peace - Boyfriend. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

A couple years ago, the answer to the question of ‚Äúwho is Master Peace‚Äù was: ‚Äúa grime rapper.‚Äù Giants like Skepta and JME supported the upcoming South London MC, and he fit nicely into the grime scene. But a natural curiosity helped this cool cat with his music‚Äôs breadth. Now incorporating alt-rock and dreamy indie pop sensibilities, MP‚Äôs work has recently become a truer reflection of his overall tastes; he frequently lists Bastille, Arctic Monkeys, and Bloc Party as influences. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to do it for people that don‚Äôt fit in,‚Äù says the ‚ÄúEyes On You‚Äù singer. Fruitful collabs with SG Lewis (‚ÄúChemicals,‚Äù which is Peace‚Äôs most-streamed track to date) and No Rome & MISOGI (‚ÄúHeart Chained‚Äù) have introduced him to a crowd of new listeners. His ‚ÄòPublic Display of Affection‚Äô EP has just arrived, and that‚Äôll be the further intro for lots of folks. Our DSCVR spotlight will certainly help as well. ‚ÄúPDA‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoyfriend‚Äù sound as good in the studio as they do on Peace‚Äôs sharp new record.

Thousands face emergency Covid tests in bid to halt spread of South Africa variant in UK - BBC News,"There's growing concern among health experts about the South African variant of coronavirus after random checks found a number of cases in the UK which could not be linked to international travel. 

The health secretary for England Matt Hancock said authorities across the UK would have to ‚Äúcome down hard‚Äù on the variant. Around 80,000 people in England will be offered urgent tests for the variant.

Door to door testing will be carried out in the affected areas which include parts of London, the West Midlands, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Merseyside. 

Mr Hancock urged people in these areas to stay at home unless they ‚Äúabsolutely have to leave‚Äù.

Health officials say they are confident the current vaccines will be effective against the South African variant, although probably not as effective as they are against other known strains.

"Hot Rods, Muscle Cars & Drifting with Tanner Foust! - 2013 SEMA Week Ep. 1","On day one of 2013 SEMA Week, Hot Rod Staff Editor Mike Finnegan takes us through the Las Vegas Convention Center and points out some of the highlights from his trip at the largest aftermarket parts show in the world. Taking a break from the endless walking and crowds, Mike jumps in with Tanner Foust for a smoke filled ride around the parking lot. Finishing off his week, Finnegan attends the SEMA Cruise. A closing ceremonies of sorts, the cruise parades all the vehicles that weren't pushed into the show and is a great way to see some amazing rides you might have missed over the week.

"If You Want to be Rich, Have This Fish as Your Pet","Watch more videos in our new App: https://bit.ly/3g9KM8j 

Imagine you hit the jackpot and got $1 million. How would you spend it? Probably, you‚Äôd buy a cool house or a fabby car. Or maybe you would go on a trip around the world. Or you can use one of these crazy ideas to leave your friends speechless! It's a pity, but sometimes, even $1 million won't get you a new phone. You'll need a sum of money almost 50 times bigger. The most expensive phone in the world cost its lucky owner more than $48 million.

Curiously enough, the world's most expensive car costs less than half the price of the aforementioned phone. But with the million you've won, you can buy the most expensive bicycle in the world. It's made of 24 carat pure gold and is called the ""Beverly Hills Edition."" The bicycle is decorated with custom-made emblems and diamonds. So, today, we'll talk about outrageously expensive items that will surprise even those who are used to throwing money away.

Venezuela crisis: Defectors fear for families - BBC News,"Venezuelan soldiers who defected into Colombia on Saturday say they fear for the safety of their families under President Nicol√°s Maduro's government.

Speaking exclusively to the BBC's Orla Guerin, one defector aged 23 says he is worried forces loyal to the president may ""lash out against my family"".

""But I think it was the best decision I could have made,"" he adds.
More than 100 soldiers are said to have defected, most during deadly clashes over aid deliveries on Saturday.

Tensions were high after President Maduro sent troops to block roads and bridges at the borders of neighbouring Brazil and Colombia, where food and medicine deliveries, organised by the US, were set to enter the country.

New Novavax vaccine is ‚Äúhighly effective‚Äù against UK Covid variant - BBC News,"A fourth vaccine could be approved shortly in the UK after trials showed it was particularly effective against the UK coronavirus variant. 

Novavax is a US vaccine being produced in the UK on Teeside.   The British government has 60 million doses on order. 

Meanwhile the UK has insisted that existing vaccine supplies won't be interrupted despite a continuing row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over shortages. 

Almost seven and a half million people have now had at least one dose of the vaccine in the UK - that's far higher than countries across the EU. 

The row was sparked when AstraZeneca said it wouldn't be able to deliver all the doses promised to the EU by March. 

The EU has called for some of the vaccines made in the UK to be diverted and warned it could resort to legal action.

France, Portugal and Germany are just some of the EU member states struggling to get hold of enough vaccine supplies.  Vaccinations are having to be postponed before the roll out has really begun. 

Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by medical editor Fergus Walsh and by Jenny Hill in Germany.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

How a Pregnant Woman in a Remote Indigenous Community Delivered Safely,"Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) teams in  Delta Amacuro, northeastern Venezuela, help provide access to primary health care to indigenous communities, focusing on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 

These remote communities, located along the Orinoco River, face significant challenges in receiving health care. MSF coordinates with the state health authorities and regional health facilities to connect people with care. Teams also conduct water and sanitation services and health promotion. 

MSF works closely with the communities and local leaders to provide health services in a way that does not contradict people's cultural beliefs and customs. We also help build capacity by training local health personnel and promoting community participation in health practices. Read more at https://bit.ly/3XVQoJl

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

The beauty pageant where looks don't matter - BBC News,"Tiffani Johnson, 22, has grown up longing to win a beauty contest. But having Down's Syndrome meant she wasn't able to compete on a level playing field until the Miss Amazing pageant began.
The event was set up in 2007 by Jordan Somer to celebrate women with disabilities. The first one was held in her hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Today it is hosted in 30 states, and has seen more than 650 girls and women with disabilities competing for the Miss Amazing crown. The contestants are judged on their levels of self-confidence, how they present themselves and how they interact with the judges and the audience rather than on how they look. Somer says this is what makes the event different. 
Johnson, from Ohio, won her state title and went for the national crown - along with thirty other young women with learning disabilities. BBC News went along to the final in Los Angeles, California, to find out how she got on.

No Rome - Trust3000 (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"No Rome - Trust3000 - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

In The 1975‚Äôs ‚ÄòSincerity Is Scary‚Äô video, Matty Healy leaves his apartment and immediately daps up a dog-walking, blue-haired neighbor in an orange jumpsuit. Rome Gomez, aka No Rome, is the guy with the leash, and the moment serves as a solid metaphor for the creative relationship that he shares with his famous pal. At this point, Rome‚Äôs career is nicely intertwined with that of the Brit rocker. After all, it was Healy who flew the Manilla native, music-school dropout and blossoming indie pop hero to London to clock a little career ascendance. After impressive vids for ‚ÄúSeventeen‚Äù and ‚ÄúSaint Laurent,‚Äù he formally united with the ‚Äò75 on last year‚Äôs ‚ÄúNarcissist.‚Äù It says a lot about No Rome‚Äôs potential that we chose him for Artists to Watch 2020, because this past year was already quite fruitful for the buttery-voiced fashionista with the R&B tones. He spanned the globe on tour with Team Healy, including a homecoming gig in the Philippines, and still found time to hit our DSCVR studios for a romp through ‚ÄúPink‚Äù and ‚ÄúCashmoney.‚Äù According to a recent Beats1 interview, Rome also worked with the frontman and drummer George Daniel on the forthcoming ‚Äò75 record. At the end of November, Rome heads out on a 20-show UK run with fellow Dirty Hit roster-mates Beabadoobee and Oscar Lang. Yes, his name is getting out there. Somehow, in between the flurry of activity, we were able to get him back in the DSCVR studio, where he debuted two irresistible newbies: ‚ÄúTalk Nice‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrust 3000.‚Äù Get to know this indie darling before everyone else does.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

39 found dead in lorry 'were Chinese nationals' - BBC News,"The 39 people found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex were Chinese nationals, it is understood.

Police are continuing to question lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, who was arrested on suspicion of murder.

Officers in Northern Ireland have raided two houses and the National Crime Agency said it was working to identify ""organised crime groups who may have played a part"".

The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

Ambulance staff discovered the bodies of the 38 adults and one teenager in the container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays just after 01:30 BST on Wednesday.

The lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 01:05.

Police said the tractor unit - the front part of the lorry - came from Northern Ireland and picked up the trailer from Purfleet.

"Uber lobbied top politicians at undeclared meetings, leaked files show - BBC News","Thousands of leaked files have exposed how Uber courted top politicians, and how far it went to avoid justice.

The documents were leaked to the Guardian, and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and a number of media organisations including BBC Panorama.

They reveal how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians in undeclared meetings to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry.

The company denies its lobbying was secret and the ministers say rules were followed.

They also show how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a ""kill switch"" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers.

Uber said its ""past behaviour wasn't in line with present values"" and it is a ""different company"" today.

HOW TO LOOK GREAT IN EVERY PHOTO,"How to be photogenic? Many people believe that the work of professional models consists only of being pretty and staring at the camera. Much of their success depends on the skills of posing and presenting themselves in the right way. There are a few crucial mistakes you should avoid to look perfect in any photo.

14 Amazing Instagram Tricks You Are Going to Love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85hvtPCB0lo&

TIMESTAMPS:
Put your chin forward 0:38
Do not cross your arms 1:07
Watch your posture 1:34
Change the angle 2:06
Turn your torso 2:38
Pay attention to your arms 3:04
Create visual lines 3:40
Combine straight and curved lines 4:10
Avoid baggy clothes 4:40
Don‚Äôt show your elbows 5:09
Imitate touching 5:42
Emphasize your face 6:19

SUMMARY:
- In any photo, your neck should remain visible. Don‚Äôt tilt your head forward; otherwise, your gaze will become 'heavy' and unwelcoming.
- Tilting your head without lowering your shoulders looks unnatural. Crossing your arms turns your whole figure into a vague blur.
- Even a slightly hunched back visually shortens your neck and ""adds"" a few extra pounds around your waist.
- Be careful with choosing the angle: the wrong one can make your arms and legs appear shorter than they are.
- If you turn your torso away from the camera too much, your shoulders will appear round and narrow, and your waist will seem wide. 
- When we‚Äôre sitting down, we often wonder where to put our arms. Crossed arms create an ugly impression, but keeping your hands loose looks unnatural.
- Standing straight with your arms hanging at your sides can hardly qualify as a photogenic pose. Besides, some items of clothing can blur together, adding width and bulkiness to your figure.
- Baggy clothes make your figure difficult to discern. They also make your body seem much wider.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- While peepholes are great because they let you see who‚Äôs outside your front door, it also works the other way around. That is, potential intruders can also find ways to look in. 
- A mailbox that‚Äôs flooded with letters and a pile of packages on the front step are clear signs for burglars that there‚Äôs no one home to pick them up. 
- An unkempt yard or a dirty pool can also make your home an obvious target for thieves in your area.
- Posting pictures online from the places you‚Äôre visiting is just letting everybody know that your house is empty.
- It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve figured out the most discreet place to hide your key, trust me, burglars know all the spots. 
- You can either leave all your precious stuff with a friend or consider renting a safety deposit box at the bank. This will ensure your valuables remain safe even if your home is broken into. 
- People usually use these timers for lamps, but TVs or radios can also be plugged into them, which really helps create the illusion that someone‚Äôs home.
- If you‚Äôre on good terms with your neighbors, ask one of them to park their car in your driveway while you‚Äôre gone.
- You‚Äôd think burglars wouldn‚Äôt be interested in a bunch of dusty tools and bikes, but you‚Äôd be surprised how much they can sell that lawn mower for!
- If you don‚Äôt want to invest in the real deal, you can fool potential burglars by placing security company signs in your yard and setting up dummy cameras near the front and back door.
- If you have a portable GPS system, just don‚Äôt leave it in the car.

Music:¬†‚Äúhappy with you‚Äù by Nion https://soundcloud.com/niyawn

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Algebra II on Khan Academy: Your studies in algebra 1 have built a solid foundation from which you can explore linear equations, inequalities, and functions. In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe. We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices. Don't let these big words intimidate you. We're on this journey with you!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

What If Giant Rats Overtook Cities and People Must Go Underground,"Most people work, eat, socialize, and enjoy life during the day. We live in tall buildings, surrounded by cleanliness and light. In a sense, rats are the exact opposite. When night falls, the rats wake up. They live below us. Sewers, pipelines, subways, abandoned stations ‚Äì these places are full of rodents in every big city. They can hold their breath underwater for several minutes, and their smooth coat allows them to swim quickly through pipes.

There have been many cases in the world when rats crawled through the pipes of multi-story buildings and private houses and got out of the toilet. Sometimes, this happened when there was a person in the bathroom. These fast, sharp-toothed animals live not only in large pipes, but in smaller, narrow ones too. It‚Äôs impossible to count the number of rats on Earth. But just in New York, there are about 2,000,000 of these animals. Now imagine what would happen if those 2 million rats became as big as sheep and came out of the sewers?

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
After three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to... give it a rest already. More specifically, he's tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. Even worse, there's been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar¬Æ winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po's Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. 
 
So, Po‚Äôs going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po‚Äôs fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon‚Äôs reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.

What If We Made a Week 10 Days Instead of 7,"Doesn't it feel like there's never enough time to get everything done? And weekends seem so short! If only we had a few more extra days in a week. Let's say, 3 more! Besides, why do we have exactly 7 days in a week and not 10? Imagine if you had a 3 day weekend instead of 2! You could have so much more fun and finally have enough to time to relax! It sounds so perfect until you realize...7 weekdays - that's 7 days in a row at school or work - would really start to take their toll...

What If You Only Ate Pizza for a Year?,"Pizza is 4th on the list of the most craved foods in the U.S. Every year, more than 3 billion pizzas are sold all over the country. And the number of pizza slices sold per second reaches a whopping 350! So what if you only ate pizza for a year? Well, that might not be as awesome as it sounds. 

There have been people who conducted some pretty bold experiments. They tried to eat pizza and nothing but pizza for 7 days in a row. And although these amateur researchers weren't connected with one another and followed this unusual diet independently, their accounts sound surprisingly similar.

TIMESTAMPS: 
Facts about a single slice of cheese pizza 1:03

SUMMARY:
- When you eat a 2-oz slice, you consume approximately 168 calories, including 54 calories just from fat alone. It contains 9% of the total fat daily value and 14% of your saturated fat daily value. 
- After the 1st day of the pizza diet, the experimenters felt some discomfort in their stomachs. A number of them even suffered from slight cramps. 
- On the morning of the 2nd day, some of these ""researchers"" noticed that their faces were puffy, and their hands were a bit swollen. Besides, they were thirsty, and their mouths felt really dry.
- The 3rd day didn't start so good at all. Some felt groggy, and others were wobbly and disoriented. Most of the experimenters constantly felt thirsty and were unable to quench this thirst with water
- On the 4th day, many of the experimenters woke up to discover some red spots and blemishes on their faces. They had problems keeping their eyes open during the day and went to bed early feeling completely exhausted. 
- Some of the ""researchers"" stated that on the 5th day of the experiment, they felt that their minds weren't as sharp as before and their thoughts were scattered. Their faces, legs, and feet were so swollen.
- On the 6th day, nothing changed dramatically. However, the ones who decided to hit the gym felt weak and unmotivated. On top of that, they noticed a significant decrease in their endurance and strength. 
- The 7th and final day of eating only pizza made almost everybody draw a disappointing conclusion: this isn't a food you can survive on for long.
- High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, insulin resistance, and high cholesterol can be unwanted and dangerous consequences of such food preferences. 
- If you choose pizza with a generous layer of veggies on top, you'll get more nutrients and vitamins from it. For example, tomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant called lycopene.
- Mushrooms are a perfect source of potassium and riboflavin. These elements keep your central nervous system healthy. Olives are full of vitamin E, which prevents cell damage, polyphenols that fight inflammation, and monounsaturated fats, which increase good cholesterol.

Jordan Peterson on the 'backlash against masculinity' - BBC News,"The Canadian psychologist Jordan B Peterson says there is a ""backlash"" against masculinity and ""a sense there is something toxic about masculinity"".
He told Hardtalk's Stephen Sackur: ""There are biological differences between men and women that express themselves in temperament and in occupational choice and that any attempt to enforce equality of outcomes is unwarranted and ill advised as a consequence.""
Mr Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote for Chaos.

 ‚ù§   WE  Will Really Appreciate Your Feedback . 
                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Ferrari 296 GTB  - DRIVEN! Ferrari‚Äôs Baby Pocket Rocket Drives as Good as It Looks,"The Ferrari 296 GTB is something of a legend in the MotorTrend offices; the quickest rear-wheel-drive production car we have ever tested. The 296GTB is something of a line in the sand for Ferrari - after the V8 celebration that was the F8 Tributo, came this: a mid-engine twin-turbo V6 with an electric motor. The Halo SF90 may have two more cylinders, and three electric motors as opposed to the single one in this, but the 296 has a certain livability that makes It genuinely compelling. Also, the two are dead equal across a quarter mile - 9.6 seconds, but get this, the lighter 296 was traveling faster. I‚Äôm surprised Ferrari allowed those two to be that close!

But what is it like for those who make it through but are then rejected? Three former contestants, Jade Richards, Ryan-Lee Seager and Shereece Foster, told reporter Catrin Nye about the pressures of returning to normal life. X Factor responded, saying a psychologist was available for contestants during and after leaving the competition. The programme also denied Jade's claim that the judges' comments about her performance had been edited.

New York City Food Tour : HUGE Pastrami Sandwich at Katz‚Äôs Deli and The Halal Guys!,"Join me on this delicious New York City food tour!
‚ñ∫Check out my NYC food guide: https://goo.gl/xubRjU
‚ñ∫Get a t-shirt here: https://goo.gl/3dV4uu

New York City is an incredible food city because of the diversity of the food available. On this New York City food tour we started off the day by going to one of the most famous restaurants in NYC, Katz's Delicatessen to eat pastrami. Next, we ate at a restaurants in New York City Chinatown called Spicy Village for an amazing pan of ‚ÄúSpicy Big Tray Chicken,‚Äù and for dinner I had chicken over rice from The Halal Guys, one of the most popular New York City street foods.

1:21 Katz's Delicatessen - There are few places in New York City for food as famous as Katz's Delicatessen, an absolute legendary deli in the city. Although it‚Äôs well overpriced, because it‚Äôs such a heritage NYC institution, it‚Äôs one of the must eat restaurants in the city. I arrived early in the morning, hoping to beat the crowds, which I did (go for breakfast if you want to avoid lines). After a little contemplation, I decided to go for the reuben with pastrami and a half of corned beef. The corned beef was alright, but the reuben with pastrami was incredible. Total price - $48.56

13:32 Spicy Village - Next up on this New York City food tour my wife and I walked around New York City Chinatown and eventually found our way over to a restaurant called Spicy Village (thanks to Monty for this recommendation). The one dish I mainly wanted to eat at Spicy Village was the Spicy big tray chicken, a pan of fried chicken parts and noodles in a spicy and mouth numbing broth. It was everything I had hoped for and more, and it was one of the best foods I ate in New York City! Total price - $22 - But along with the spicy big tray chicken we had an extra dish as well. 

18:32 Times Square - One of the busiest and most recognized squares in the world is Times Square in New York City. So in the afternoon, happy and full of Spicy Village and Katz‚Äôs Deli, we walked over to Times Square to enjoy the people watching and the ridiculous amount of lights and action.

20:19 The Halal Guys - While walking through Times Square I remembered that one of the most popular New York City street food stalls wasn‚Äôt too far away. So we walked over to The Halal Guys, and I ordered chicken over rice. The chicken over rice itself is prepared pretty plain, but the flavor in The Halal Guys is all in the white and red sauce, both of which are incredibly flavorful and delicious. It was my first time to eat at The Halal Guys, and I‚Äôm pretty happy I did. Chicken over rice - $7

It was a great first full day in New York City with some incredibly delicious food. Probably my favorite dish of the day was the spicy big tray chicken from Spicy Village, but all the food was so food.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

GOLDEN MEAT JACUZZI üåÆ Carnitas Tacos + Loaded Quesadillas!! Best Street Food in Los Angeles!!,"üåÆ Follow Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures 
ü•© Mexican Street Food in LA (Part 1): https://youtu.be/BEbKyZSpBQk
üîî SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe Don‚Äôt miss new food videos!

LOS ANGELES: Welcome to LA, home of some of the best Mexican street food in the world! Today I‚Äôm hanging out with my friend Mexi Papa, and he‚Äôs taking us to a few of his favorite spots, including an amazing spot for carnitas, deep fried chicken necks, and a place that serves one of the best and freshest quesadillas I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Get ready for amazing Mexican street food in Los Angeles!

Carnitas el Momo (https://goo.gl/maps/32BbkJTGRSpSXspv7) - First we headed to Carnitas el Momo, one of the best places for carnitas in LA. They boil the pork in huge bathtub sized copper pots, just like in Mexico. Their carnitas are moist and so flavorful. Along with all the different parts of the pig, the highlight at Carnitas el Momo is the burnt ends - all the drippings from the bottom of the pan that accumulate the most flavor.

Santa Rita Jalisco Taco Truck (https://goo.gl/maps/LdQ6ckeYq1asECyD9) - Next up on this Mexican street food tour in LA, we headed to Santa Rita Jalisco Taco Truck which is legendary for their deep fried chicken necks. They are deep fried for 20 minutes until the entire chicken neck is crispy all the way through. What really makes them is the fresh salsa!

Tacos Los Poblanos #1 Estilo Tijuana (https://goo.gl/maps/iTbH6mFH5sTZo5CA6) - Finally to end this food tour, we headed to Tacos Los Poblanos #1 Estilo Tijuana, a Mexican food stall that sets up outdoors and serves everything fresh - from the tortillas to the meats to the salsas. Along with a huge selection of things you can order, one of the highlights for me was a huge fresh quesadilla, loaded with both carne asada and chorizo, guacamole and salsa. 

And that wraps up another amazing day of Mexican street food in Los Angeles!

Lyrics:
A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who‚Äôve gone before us and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
 
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all
 
And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever
 
If you‚Äôve been forgiven and if you‚Äôve been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We‚Äôll sing the song forever and amen
 
Hear your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever
 
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

"Hurricane, Tornado, Cyclone ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Difference?","What is the difference between a tornado and a hurricane? And what about typhoon? First, let‚Äôs get it straight: all these weather phenomena have to do with strong winds. Not my-umbrella-got-torn-from-my-hands strong, mind you, but rather my-house-got-blown-away-to-the-Land-of-Oz kind of thing. Yet before we get to the actual difference between hurricanes and typhoons, we must understand that they‚Äôre one and the same thing called a tropical cyclone.

If you live in moderate or colder climates, there‚Äôs nothing for you to worry about, even if your house is right by the seaside, because you‚Äôll only hear about cyclones from the news. After all, they‚Äôre called tropical for a reason: they only form in tropical or subtropical areas, because they need warm water to get things going.

SUMMARY:
- A tropical cyclone is a huge mass of clouds that gather in the sky and start rotating counter clock-wise due to very low air pressure. 
- Cyclones occur much more often than you think! But only few of them grow large and strong enough to become hurricanes or typhoons.
- The weakest version of a tropical cyclone is called a tropical depression. It‚Äôs a similar swirling mass of clouds, usually accompanied by storms, but the force of winds in it is not very high. 
- When the winds are stronger than 39 mph, the cyclone is then called a tropical storm. This is a more serious threat, and you‚Äôll do well to hide inside your house because gusts of wind might reach 72 mph. 
- And only if the wind gets even more powerful than that, then it can be called a hurricane or a typhoon.
- If a severe tropical cyclone with wind speeds of over 75 mph occurs in the North Atlantic or North-East Pacific, it‚Äôs called a hurricane. If it‚Äôs in the North-West Pacific, then it‚Äôs a typhoon.
- We hear more about hurricanes than typhoons because the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than the Pacific, and warm water acts like a fuel for cyclones.
- Tornadoes can form almost anywhere they please, both over sea and over land. But there‚Äôs much more to it than that.
- A tornado is a swirling funnel of air coming down from the sky. It appears during thunderstorms, and it‚Äôs rather a consequence than a reason for severe weather. 
- But despite its terrible power, a tornado is a very local event, and short-lived at that. The biggest one ever registered by scientists was just over 1.5 mi in diameter and lasted about an hour or so.
- The center, in its turn, is usually calm and windless ‚Äî so calm, in fact, that it‚Äôs almost creepy. It‚Äôs called the eye of the tornado or the hurricane, and it‚Äôs basically the safest place to be when the phenomenon comes to you.
- There are 5 categories of hurricanes according to the National Weather Service. Category 1 is just slightly more intense than a tropical storm, and in some countries it‚Äôs still considered as such. 
- Category 2 is another story altogether. The wind blows at speeds of up to 109 mph, and that‚Äôs where the real trouble starts.
- When a hurricane grows to Category 3, it‚Äôs already a disaster. First of all, it‚Äôs big. Secondly, it‚Äôs powerful. The winds are reaching 129 mph, and catching such a gust is like being hit with a race car.
- A Category 4 major hurricane is something you don‚Äôt want to see with your own eyes. With gusts of wind up to 157 mph, it can tear trees from the ground and hurl fairly large objects in the air, causing lots of damage. 
- And finally, a Category 5 major hurricane is a thing to be avoided at all costs. In other classifications it‚Äôs even called a super typhoon or a super cyclonic storm, which says a lot.

The Global Philospher: Should the Rich World Pay for Climate Change? - BBC News,"Sixty people from 30 countries join Michael Sandel in a digital studio at Harvard to discuss the philosophical issues underlying the world's response to climate change. The developed world has caused climate change, belting out greenhouse gases as it became rich (at least, most people think so). But the developing world ‚Äì huge and growing economies like India and China ‚Äì is increasingly a big part of the problem. So who should pay to fix the mess? Is it fair to penalise the developing world as it strives to catch up? Is it acceptable that rich countries be allowed to buy credits, giving them permission to pollute? And is it time to re-think our material aspirations?

Lyrics
Went insane, broken but I‚Äôm feeling straight 
Back and forth across the map I take off early, get in late
My home paid the cost and fell apart, I had to renovate 
Devil busy, got me fighting for my life like MMA
Went through hard times but something always on my dinner plate 
God came in my life and told me ‚ÄúMove and let me demonstrate‚Äù 
Now I‚Äôm back by popular demand just like a senate race 
Devil busy, got me fighting for my life like MMA
Know that
Pocket watching, no that
Put the beat on, I snap in a flash and black like Kodak 
OD, get a toe tag
DOA no DEA if in the A, shut your trap
DJ Montay told me ‚Äúwalk it out‚Äù so I don‚Äôt hold back 
I‚Äôm my faith like the clergy do 
Church but ain‚Äôt churchy, they judge me but I‚Äôm busy sipping His mercy
Some people stay thirsty, I cut ‚Äòem like surgery 
I‚Äôm moving this work see the grams, He for certain
Built for this like an activist
Even haters trying to snap a pic
Holy rollers still be cappin‚Äô quick
I know He chose me, you ain‚Äôt have to pick
God is good, life is great, till it ain‚Äôt
Hell it comes, when it‚Äôs Heaven, throw my hands up, I‚Äôm like great
I‚Äôm winded for real
Trying to outrun all my guilt 
No way that I ain‚Äôt quit
That ain‚Äôt the way that I‚Äôm built 
Harris County had me locked down way before the Covid lockdown, uh 
Nothing new to me, I know that I‚Äôm free
Back up on my feet, get with Pound and leave 
Real ones stay down and invite you around, that‚Äôs even without all the glory 
That‚Äôs when it hit me some never been with me, but all of them say that they for me
But my girl clutch with a clutch, fancy like it‚Äôs payday 
With lemon pepper wings from JJ‚Äôs, we might hit up Pei Wei just like it‚Äôs her birthday 
I‚Äôm dropping gems on the world, giving free game like Google search 
Unashamed put in work, my girl don‚Äôt twerk but make money bounce
In London, we gaining some pounds
Stack bread, don‚Äôt gain an ounce King ‚Äòcause He gave a the crown
We came to shut it all down
God on my side He been at the wheel
Inheriting blessings, I been in His will 
Answer the call you know that I will
Seasons change summer came and went but I‚Äôm still hot 
He‚Äôs insane, some would say he crazy but I‚Äôm not 
Chasing what He gave me, this a legend in the making 
I know when it‚Äôs all, said and done, we‚Äôll be at the top 
You ain‚Äôt know, you ain‚Äôt know, back and forth across the map I take off early, get in late
My home paid the cost and fell apart I had to renovate 
Devil busy, got me fighting for my life like MMA

Israel election: Netanyahu and rival headed for deadlock - BBC News,"Unofficial results in Israel's second election in five months suggest it is too close to call, Israeli media say.

Incumbent PM Benjamin Netanyahu's party and that of his main challenger, Benny Gantz, are neck and neck with 32 seats each, the Kan public broadcaster says.

A prime minister needs to command a 61-seat majority in parliament. The smaller Yisrael Beiteinu party appears to hold the balance of power.

Official partial results are expected on Wednesday morning.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been in office for 10 years and is vying to win a record fifth term in office.

The 69-year-old, who leads the right-wing Likud party, has pledged to annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnZ-E3-LfKw

Queen still 'in good health' - BBC News,"BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says the prince and his wife flew to Scotland on Sunday, although they did not travel on a scheduled flight.

He adds that they were both tested on Monday and got their results last night.

Prince Charles's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw his mother, the Queen. Palace officials say the Monarch remains in ""good health"".

The prince, 71, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, are self-isolating at Birkhall on the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire.

A Palace statement said: ""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing.""

9 Facts We Should Finally Stop Believing,"There are some so-called ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that we believe only because we‚Äôve heard them so many times. I bet you‚Äôre convinced that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world. We're about to reveal the actual truth about some things you believed in before. 

For example, a lot of people don‚Äôt eat chocolate because they‚Äôre afraid it‚Äôll cause their skin to break out in pimples. Well, hold back no more because this simply isn‚Äôt true! [dermatologist] Dr. James E. Fulton Jr. and several other dermatologists conducted a study on the supposed connection between chocolate and acne. They actually gave 65 acne-prone test subjects chocolate bars that contained 10 times more cocoa than a typical bar of chocolate. What they found was that chocolate isn‚Äôt harmful to¬†our skin and doesn‚Äôt affect it¬†whatsoever!

TIMESTAMPS: 
The placebo effect only works on humans 0:39
Milk is useful for our bones 1:30
Chocolate causes acne 2:14
If you run, you have to run every single day 3:10
Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world 3:55
A black hole is, well, a hole 4:44
You‚Äôre safe inside a car during a lightning storm 5:25
The Sahara is the largest desert in the world 6:04
Mars is red 7:02

SUMMARY: 
- The placebo effect probably works on pets too! For example, if a dog is sick and its owner gives it a sugar or vitamin pill, the dog‚Äôs body responds well.
- Scientists from Harvard University have found that people from countries that don‚Äôt usually consume dairy products actually suffer from fractures less than those who consume such products regularly. So there‚Äôs no sense in drinking large amounts of milk if you wanna strengthen your bones.
- A lot of people don‚Äôt eat chocolate because they‚Äôre afraid it‚Äôll cause their skin to break out in pimples. Well, hold back no more because this simply isn‚Äôt true!
- Too much endurance running may have an adverse effect on a person‚Äôs well-being because it pushes the body too much. Another study noticed plaque buildup in the arteries of marathon runners that may cause decreased blood circulation, eventually leading to serious heart problems.
- The new #1 spot would go to Mauna Kea, a volcano located in Hawaii. It has an altitude of 13,796 feet above sea level, but its base is about 19,700 feet below the water‚Äôs surface. 
- Black holes are practically invisible and can‚Äôt be seen with the naked eye. However, astronomers locate them with the help of super advanced space telescopes by seeing how stars that are close to black holes act differently than other stars.
- Your car may be a really good place to hide but only because it‚Äôs made from metal. And that metal body will only be of any use if all the doors and windows are closed.
- Antarctica, with an area of 5.5 million square miles, is technically the largest desert in the world! The Sahara, at 3.5 million square miles, takes 3rd place. 
- The images taken by the Viking 1 Lander make the planet look redder than it actually is. Today, NASA admits that some parts of Mars are actually blue and grey.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé

40 EASY DIY CLOTHES UPGRADES,"CLOTHES UPGRADES

Everyone has that old t-shirt/shirt that they‚Äôre just not ready to get rid of. Maybe it‚Äôs faded, or maybe it‚Äôs just always been too big for everyday wear. DIY projects are usually the answer to saving old clothing from meeting the trash can! Check out this technique for turning a big, old t-shirt into a versatile, trendy bodysuit!

Find your old t-shirt. Shirts that are at least a little bit oversized work best. Choose something awesome, like a band tee!

Try the shirt on. If it‚Äôs too short or too tight, it‚Äôs probably not the right shirt for this project. You want it to be a little bit oversized.

Gather your materials. You‚Äôll need:

Another t-shirt that fits you well (You‚Äôll use this as a guide)
Elastic lace ribbon
Scissors
A pair of underwear that fits you well (classic underwear cut or by shorts style works best)
Your sewing machine
Pins
A needle and thread for hand sewing
2-3 snaps
A stitch ripper (or small nail scissors)

Unravel the hem all the way along the bottom of the t-shirt. Use your stitch ripper or small nail scissors to cut the hem stitching.

Place the pair of underwear you‚Äôve chosen on top of your shirt so that the center of the bottom lines up with the middle of the shirt‚Äôs front along the bottom. Cut the t-shirt in line with the leg holes in the underwear.

Measure the height and width of the material along the crotch of the underwear.

From the scrap t-shirt piece you just got off, cut two strips of fabric that measure the same height and width as the crotch of the underwear.

Place your correctly sized shirt on top of the oversized shirt.

Cut pieces from the larger shirt around the smaller shirt to size it properly to your body. The smaller shirt acts as your pattern.

Turn the newly cut pieces of your larger shirt over so the outsides (i.e. the front and the back) face each other. Sew the side seams together with the pieces turned this way.

With your bodysuit still turned inside out, line up the two pieces of material you cut for the crotch earlier, pinning them to each other. Then, line up the end of one piece with the back of the bodysuit where it tapers. Sew the edges and the seam.

Fold and pin the hem around the leg holds of your bodysuit in place. Pin your lace elastic into place along the hem as well. Sew it all into place using a zig zag stitch on your sewing machine.

Fold the edges of the crotch pieces under and sew along the fold.

Hand sew your snaps into place at the edge of your crotch panels. This lets you undo the bodysuit to get it on and off.

Enjoy your new bodysuit!

What Makes a Molecule? | Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains‚Ä¶,"What makes a molecule? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice explore atoms versus molecules. What makes molecules behave the way they do?

We dive into different molecules and the atoms that make them. Can you tell what a molecule does based on the atoms inside? Find out about water, sodium chloride, buckminsterfullerene, and other molecules. How many configurations of carbon are there? How much of the universe is made up of hydrogen and helium? We discuss silicon-based life and what elements on the periodic table are the most chemically active in the universe. Is there anything the universe can‚Äôt teach us?

LYRICS

Dayme y el high
Ella se tarda arregl√°ndose un par de horas
Llama a su amiga, no le gusta salir sola
Y de la noche dejarse llevar, oh oh oh

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es bien bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Se pone caliente, cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es bien bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Que se prepare pa la fiesta
Que la cintura ta
Me peca que √©l prende y que suba esa tela
De la que t√∫ est√°s fincado, hasta aqu√≠ a ti te duele
T√∫ eres mi beb√©, no te me salgas de en frente
B√°ilalo fuerte, qu√© importa la gente
Al carrete le importa la gente
To' eso pa' m√≠, bail√°ndo te di fuerte
ma√±ana te dir√©

Y esto no para, hasta que est√©s sin conciencia
Que fuiste la paciencia y te suelten las piernas
Hoy pa' mami te d√©, t√∫ la entiendes
Es adicci√≥n que me pone y me tiene

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Se pone caliente, cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Ella pide que la toque
Aveces que la bese
Me manda razones que cuando amanece
Ya viene encendida, la tengo en la mira
Fiera de noche, una santa de d√≠a

Baby, el ritmo se adue√±a de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a m√≠ tambi√©n
Que nos pasemos la noche d√°ndole
Baby, el ritmo se adue√±a de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a m√≠ tambi√©n
Que nos pasemos la noche d√°ndole (oye esto)

Si t√∫ pides perreo, toma perreo
B√°ilalo, no no, no tengas miedo
Tienes la pa' que lo sigas sin l√≠imite

Y si t√∫ quieres, igual yo quiero, p√©gate
Vamos a hacerlo sin
Aqu√≠ no hay que esconderse
Solo tienes que moverte y encenderte

Y si t√∫ quieres, igual yo quiero, p√©gate
Vamos a hacerlo sin
Aqu√≠ no hay que esconderse
P√©gate

Bien chula
Se pone coqueta la nena
Ella sabe que est√° buena
Y bien chula, fuera del planeta ella es

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Se pone caliente, cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo tambi√©n me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ah√≠ tan s√≥lita
Con esa cinturita, bail√°ndome cerquita

Viva la music (viva la music)

Thai Street Food - GRILLED CHICKEN Basin BBQ!! üêì üçó Most FAMOUS Grilled Chicken in Thailand!!,"üêì Thai Street Food - Khao Suan Kwang Grilled Chicken (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á)!
ü¶ê WATCH - Giant Fried Garlic Shrimp - https://youtu.be/j8u3WvWT6HI

KHON KAEN (‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô) - Welcome to Khon Kaen (‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô) province in the Isaan (northeastern region) of Thailand, and more specifically Khao Suan Kwang district - famous for their unique style of grilled chicken! In this video you have a chance to see their secret recipe and reason why this Thai street food grilled chicken is so incredibly tasty! #streetfood #ThaiFood #KhonKaen

First of all, you arrive to the town, and it‚Äôs literally a massive highway, with about 50 different grilled chicken restaurants and street food stalls to choose from, all displaying the unique grilled chicken of this district.

Oom Im Restaurant (‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πã‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏¥‡πã‡∏° ‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á https://goo.gl/maps/uMSjSHqxnDfK7GDS6) - We chose to go to Oom Im Restaurant (‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πã‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏¥‡πã‡∏° ‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á) and I‚Äôm glad I chose them over any other options - they are family run, laid back, and so friendly. They even went the extra effort to show us all the ingredients that go into the marinade of Khao Suan Kwang Grilled Chicken (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á). There are two main reasons why this type of grilled chicken is so good - one is because of the chickens themselves - the chicken breed. Two is because of both the marinade and mainly because the grilling technique. A big part of this type of street food chicken is the way that it‚Äôs wrapped on a bamboo skewer and grilled of the basin bbq grill style!

I think I emphasized this three times in the video - but you‚Äôll see the chickens on the grill and they look scrawny and dried up, but you‚Äôll be so surprised how moist and juicy the chicken is. The flavor, the texture, the creaminess, and the crispy skin, is on all another level.

Kai yang Khao Suan Kwang - 120 THB per chicken, 400 total bill

Oom Im Restaurant (‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πã‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏¥‡πã‡∏° ‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á) - Khao Suan Kwang Grilled Chicken (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á) - https://goo.gl/maps/uMSjSHqxnDfK7GDS6
Price - 120 THB ($3.97) per chicken

Russian President Putin speaks at Crimea celebration event - BBC News,"Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to tens of thousands of Russians at an event celebrating eight years since the annexation of Crimea.

The stadium was awash with Russian flags and the letter ""Z"", which has come to symbolise the invasion.

Putin hailed Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine, claiming its objective is to save locals ""from suffering from genocide"".

The Russian president told the crowd: ""We know what we have to do next... we'll definitely carry out all the plans we have made."" But his address on state TV suddenly cut to singer Oleg Gazmanov belting out the words ""Forward, Russia"", in what the Kremlin later called a technical glitch.

Why Watermelon Juice Is So Unpopular + Other Simple Why-s,"Ever wondered why watermelon juice hasn't quite made it to the A-list of popular beverages? Well, it turns out, despite watermelon being a summer favorite, its juice faces some challenges. Watermelon is over 90% water, making the juice a bit less concentrated and sweet compared to other fruit juices. The fruit's high perishability and tendency to separate into layers can make it less convenient for mass production. But that's not all ‚Äì we'll unravel other everyday mysteries, answering simple ""why-s"" that might have crossed your mind. From quirky food preferences to interesting scientific tidbits, this video is a delightful journey into the whys of our everyday experiences.

Audrey Mika - 4712 (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Audrey Mika - 4712. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

Sometimes it's necessary to let go of something to make room for what you really love. When Audrey Mika abandoned her childhood dreams of a ballet career, she turned to making music for comfort during the emotional fallout. As if it was destiny, the soft-spoken kid from Oakland almost immediately earned mad love from online listeners. Maybe it was because people loved her ethereal covers of Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish hits. Maybe it was because she was so emotionally candid on camera, sharing her tears with her audience. Maybe it was because it was a thrill to watch a young artist embark on an ascent from the square one. Of course, it coulda been that big pink microphone. Multi-million views mean starpower no matter how you slice it. Now based in LA, the 19-year-old, who wrote and recorded her first two projects, ‚ÄòAre We There Yet‚Äô and ‚ÄòLevel Up,‚Äô is poised to make the next big leap. In between tour stops, promoting the new ‚Äò5 A.M.‚Äô EP, Audrey answered the call of the DSCVR stamp of approval. Check out ‚Äú4712‚Äù - and get to know this pop star-in-the-making before everyone else does.

US lawmakers approve $1tn in infrastructure spending - BBC News,"The US Congress has passed a landmark $1tn (¬£741bn) infrastructure spending package, delivering a major domestic win to President Joe Biden.

Negotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats.

Meanwhile the House is moving forward with a more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberal lawmakers.

The infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.

Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks.

Old Faces
How does it feel when someone strips you bare?
How does it feel when there‚Äôs light shining on your every intention.
‚ÄòCause people laugh at you
For trying to change the world.

It‚Äôs just
Small Town
Small Dreams
The same old faces
Still they haunt me
And I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to shut them out
I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to block them out

I‚Äôm tired of them looking down.
Tired of them looking down.

How does it feel when someone lets you down?
You got a head full of thorns,
When you should really be wearing a crown.
Well, at least a crowded room will never seem empty
With a conscience always siding against me.

Small Town
Lay to rest
Don‚Äôt hurt me with your
Killer lines and cigarettes.
I want more than just your
Teenage thrills and brainless sex.
Tell me just how good it feels
To be rebellious.
‚ÄòCause you got me feeling down.
Said it‚Äôs got me feelin down.
Oh

How does it feel when someone lets you down?
A head full of thorns, you should be wearing a crown.
And how does it feel when someone strips you bare?
And people laugh at you
People laugh at you
How do you feel about these memories?
My conscience is close
She‚Äôs my worst enemy
And she wants to know where I‚Äôve gone.
She wants to know where I‚Äôm going.

Small town lay to rest.
Small town lay to rest.

Small town
Small dreams
The same old faces.
Still they haunt me.
I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to block them out.
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm tired of them looking down.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Underwater robots find Shackleton's Endurance shipwreck in Antarctic - BBC News,"Scientists have found and filmed one of the greatest ever undiscovered shipwrecks 107 years after it sank.

The Endurance, the lost vessel of Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, was found at the weekend at the bottom of the Weddell Sea.

The ship was crushed by sea-ice and sank in 1915, forcing Shackleton and his men to make an astonishing escape on foot and in small boats.

Video of the remains show Endurance to be in remarkable condition.

"If You Lived in a Flat 2D World, Here's What You'd Look Like","Have you ever wondered what our life would be like if we lived in a 2D world instead of a 3D world? Imagine you and your friends decide to play a new board game. You roll the dice and get 5 and 3. Your pawn moves 8 spaces on the flat squares. The next morning, you wake up to‚Ä¶something bizarre. All you can see is‚Ä¶lines? There‚Äôs no height, no up or down. You try to move your head. You can‚Äôt see feet below you or a ceiling above you. Your view is limited to left and right. 

You try to jump ‚Äì no luck. You can move, but only forward, backward, left, and right. You check out your room. There are no windows, just a line blocking you from going anywhere. The wall. You head to the right and left. As you approach objects, they get brighter. You finally find the door: a brown line you can push open. You‚Äôre a flat pawn and can't lift yourself from the board or climb on top of objects ‚Äì you can only go around them. Your entire world is in 2D!

21 INCREDIBLY SATISFYING DIYs AND HACKS,"SATISFYING DIYs AND HACKS

Let's dedicate this video to the King of satisfying hacks - the great and powerful Slime! : )

How to Make Butter Slime

1. Pour 8 ounces of your white glue in a bowl.
Tip: I like to buy the large gallon-size of Elmer‚Äôs Glue since it‚Äôs the most economical. It‚Äôs easy to pour and measure out your glue with measuring cups and you can use it to make lots of batches of slime!
2. Mix your baking soda in.
3. Add you water and mix thoroughly.
4. Add the baby oil and lotion and mix.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of contact lens solution and mix.
6. Pour the slime out on the table as it will be very sticky still. This is what you want since when you add your clay it will take the stickiness away.
Add a little amount of clay and fold over your slime and knead it into the slime. Keep kneading until your slime is colored and the clay is thoroughly mixed.
7. The more you knead the less sticky it should be until it feels like regular slime. You can now stretch and fold a few times and create your own swirl!
I hope you love this butter slime recipe as much as I do! You can also substitute the clay and add some cornstarch in for a similar consistency. We would recommend about 2-4 tablespoons of cornstarch.

How to Make Glow in the Dark Slime

1. Get a bowl to mix your slime ingredients in.
2. Empty your bottle of glow in the dark glue into the bowl. Try to squeeze out as much as you can from the bottle and let it drip out. Since it‚Äôs only 5 ounces if you do not pour out everything you‚Äôll be left with a small batch of slime. We recommend doubling this recipe and using 2 bottles if you want a larger batch of slime.

Tip: Pour water that is called for in the recipe into the bottle and shake it. Then pour into your bowl to help get some of the extra glue out of the bottle.
3. Add your 1/4 tablespoon of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of water and mix thoroughly until the water is mixed in with the glue. If you want a stretchier slime you can add more water (up to 1/4 cup total).
4. Slowly add in your contact lens solution. Add in 1/2 tablespoon to start and then another 1/2 tablespoon. Add it in slowly and only as much as needed. Adding too much contact lens solution can make your slime hard and less stretchy.
Once you‚Äôve mixed in the tablespoon take the slime out and start to knead it. It will be very sticky at this point and that is normal. Just keep kneading the glow in the dark slime until it is not sticky anymore. If you still find it very sticky, add a little bit of baby oil or lotion to your hands.

Reminder: your contact lens solution should contain boric acid or your slime will not form. We like this brand the best. See also our tips on How to Make Slime with Contact Solution.
5. Now you‚Äôll need to ‚Äúcharge‚Äù your slime in light before it will glow in the dark. We recommend putting it in daylight if you can as the sun will be brighter than indoor lighting. If you have a bright indoor light that will work too. Make sure to spread the slime out flat when charging as it needs to be exposed to light on all areas for it glow.


These toothpaste hacks are crazy indeed yet they're so effective and may come in handy any day.
If you don't wanna throw away almost empty toothpaste tube and wanna use it till the last drop which is a great thing to do! Here's how you do it: cut out the upper edge of the toothpaste tube and insert a dispenser device from any empty shower gel or liquid soap.

Here's a recipe for a super effective cleaning solution. Pour a bottle of Coke into a plastic bottle and add some toothpaste. Take a spray device. Spray it on the rust or any other kind of dirt on your ceramics and faucets. And just wash it off!

If you need to clean your phone's camera or camera lens, do the following. Hold an egg above the candle fire. Apply the ashes on the cotton pad, put some toothpaste on top and clean the lenses.

While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

22 SIMPLE HOUSEHOLD HACKS,"HOUSEHOLD HACKS


Grease is the word. Whether you're frying up a pan of bacon or saut√©ing veggies in olive oil, grease splatter abounds. It multiplies in tiny little droplets and clings to your stovetop, cabinets, backsplash and any other areas close by. It's often difficult to remove, especially if you aren't able to clean it right away, so I've compiled a simple how-to for cleaning up the mess with basic items you already have in your kitchen.

Materials
Vinegar
Baking soda and/or Vegetable oil
Pour undiluted vinegar into an empty spray bottle and apply generously to the greased surface. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, then wipe clean with a dishcloth or non-abrasive scrubber.

Sprinkle baking soda on a damp sponge or non-abrasive scrubber and wipe down all greased surfaces. Follow with a clean, damp cloth to remove any powder residue.

If all else fails, a surprising grease remover is non-other than ‚Äîgrease! A natural vegetable oil on a paper towel can remove a really difficult stain. Follow up with one of the methods above for that like-new sparkle.

It's up to you what material to use! Have fun! ; )

Ela Taubert - Introducing Ela Taubert (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Introducing Ela Taubert | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Un d√≠a en oto√±o, una colonia de mariposas vino a visitar nuestra tarima de DSCVR en Brooklyn, NY. Todas le pertenec√≠an a la estrella naciente colombiana, Ela Taubert, quien fluy√≥ a trav√©s del escenario tan f√°cil como las palomillas vuelan en el cielo. La criatura es su s√≠mbolo, su emoji favorito; la representaci√≥n de la evoluci√≥n. No empece a sus humildes comienzos como letrista juvenil, Ela irrumpi√≥ en la m√∫sica latina con una fuerza indomable. Su primer EP, ‚Äò¬øC√≥mo Pas√≥‚Äô, alcanz√≥ el #12 en la lista Billboard Latin Pop Airplay y le gan√≥ el espacio en una de las carteleras m√°s codiciadas de Bogot√°: ser telonera del espect√°culo de KAROL G, Ma√±ana Ser√° Bonito. La conexi√≥n de Ela con sus fans es √≠ntima. De hecho, la cantautora ha creado un refugio; un lugar seguro donde sus fans pueden procesar sus emociones y crecer juntos, libre de juicios. ‚ÄúEstoy enfocada en poder compartir, desde la parte m√°s honesta de mi coraz√≥n, todas las cosas que he experimentado y las que me han inspirado‚Äù, le dijo Ela a Remezcla este a√±o. Influenciada por estrellas de pop como Miley Cyrus y Taylor Swift, sus letras desgarradoras reflejan los vaivenes de la juventud: enamorarse, c√≥mo curar un coraz√≥n roto y, m√°s que nada, c√≥mo mantenerse fuerte ante la adversidad. Los halagos y premios no han parado de llegar. De hecho, acaba de ganar el premio a Mejor Artista Nuevo en los Latin GRAMMY 2024. Nada grande, ¬øverdad? Seamos honestos, Ela es ley. Su personalidad dulce y su energ√≠a en la tarima hacen de ella la artista perfecta para nuestra clase DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025; una adici√≥n insuperable a nuestra casa de mariposas.

A flurry of butterflies visited our DSCVR stage in Brooklyn, NY. They all belonged to Colombian rising star Ela Taubert, who moved through her performance as flawlessly as the winged creatures fly. It‚Äôs her symbol, her favorite emoji ‚Äì a sign of transformation and evolution. Belying her humble beginnings as a teenage songwriter, Ela broke onto the scene with bombast. Her first EP, ‚Äò¬øC√≥mo Pas√≥?,‚Äô reached #12 on Billboard‚Äôs Latin Pop Airplay chart and netted her the coveted opening slot on the Bogot√° stop of KAROL G‚Äôs Ma√±ana Ser√° Bonito stadium tour. Ela‚Äôs connection with her fans is intimate. She‚Äôs created a refuge, a safe space where her fans can process their emotions and shed their skin without judgment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm focused on being able to share from the most honest part of my heart all the stories I‚Äôve experienced and been inspired by,‚Äù she told Remezcla earlier this year. Influenced by pop stars like Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift, the singer‚Äôs gut-wrenching lyrics portray the ins and outs of teenage life: falling in love, heartbreak, and most importantly empowerment in the face of adversity. Accolades have kept coming. The biggest one being her nomination for Best New Artist at the 2024 Latin GRAMMYs. No doubt, her bubbly personality and energetic performance style make a perfect addition to our DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025 class, like the butterfly house exhibit of our zoo of talent.

What Will Happen In the Next 5 Seconds,"What happens every 5 seconds? While we‚Äôre just sitting in front of our computer at home, drinking tea with some cookies, really incredible things are happening on the other side of the world. Or maybe in the nearby city. Or even one mile away from us! Millions of mind-blowing things are happening in this short period. For example, in 5 seconds, 500,000 reactions occur in your body‚Äôs cells. 4 weddings take place somewhere in the world every 5 seconds, and one more union is sealed before another second passes.

While you will be going from your desk to your fridge and opening it, 47 new websites will be created! Posts of strangers on Facebook will receive 2.3 million likes in the same period of time. New post count on Facebook will reach 205,000. And Instagram will boast 3,200 newly uploaded photos and videos within the same period! Isn't it amazing that so many things happen in the world every 5 seconds? See for yourself!

Lyrics: 
Remember late night drives up to your house 
Just two lost souls tryna figure it out  
We want it all but I‚Äôm just too scared
 
Not much has changed not nothin‚Äô new
We shared our lives what lovers do  
You showed it all and I‚Äôm not prepared 
 
I can‚Äôt be your hero
We‚Äôre heading straight into the place 
We call ground zero
Hit a low now I know
I can‚Äôt be your last call 
We set the bar and showed our scars 
Then watched it all fall
And I can‚Äôt mend but I know a man who, can!
 
Remember late night drives just you and me
Made promises we couldn‚Äôt keep
I showed it all and you weren‚Äôt prepared 
You‚Äôre making problems in your head again darling just stop it 
Don‚Äôt know why you let ‚Äòem in every so often 
I can‚Äôt be your medicine 
If I was honest, but I promise 
 
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
 
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
Ouuuu, ouuuuu
 
I can‚Äôt be your

HEX - Stunna (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Hex - Stunna - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Simply dubbed by many as ""the UK's answer to Post Malone"", this comparison doesn't tell the whole story for Hex, an artist pushing boundaries with his slick genre fluid music. Dropping tunes fusing Rap, R&B and Afrobeats alongside a distinct visual signature, the Nottingham-born artist deserves way more recognition than just one simplistic comparison. His gritty, dark and often melodic sounds are ushering in a new wave for UK hip-hop. Stand out track ""Stunna"" showcases Hex's ability to create beats that seem beyond his years, a certified rap/R&B banger that wouldn't look out of place on the Hot 100. With collaborations with alt-j and Yungen already in the bag, the hype just isn't going to end for Hex. This is an artist that's going to dominate 2019, shaking off the comparisons and make waves in his own style.

Lyrics:
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the lights out
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
Whoa, oh, oh
I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind, woah-oh
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the lights out
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
Whoa oh oh
Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably-lably-lably-lably)
I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind

Afghanistan's destroyed Buddhas to return - BBC News,"When the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 1996, they imposed an extremist version of Islamic law across the country. They tried to erase all traces of a rich pre-Islamic past and ordered the destruction of ancient statues, including the world's tallest standing Buddhas.

Those memories are still alive for millions of Afghans. And now they have become present concerns, as the US and Afghan government negotiate with the Taliban for a deal that could see them return to power in Afghanistan.

The BBC's Shoaib Sharifi visited the National Museum in Kabul where a team are rebuilding some of the ancient Buddha sculptures that were destroyed by the Taliban.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

26 Dollar Store Art Ideas That Are So Mesmerizing,"Incredible DIY art ideas to decorate your home on a budget

We all know how expensive art can be, even decorative ones. So, why not use your own tools and creativity to make beautiful paintings for your walls using cheap materials. 
Take an old serving tray and add some rocks at the bottom of it. Then pour epoxy resin on top of them and on the other side of the tray pour some blue resin to make it resemble the ocean. Slowly layer it into a gradient effect, mix it together, let it dry, and voila. 
You can also pour different colored acrylic paints on a canvas, and then blow-dry them. This will make a beautiful splattered abstract piece for your walls   
Instead of making a regular painting, you can also make 3D art everyone will love. For example, use fake plants to create tropical scenery or use some clay to create a beautiful 3D landscape. 
Another great hack is to take canvas paper, dip one of your feet in paint and then dance on it.

Barack Obama praises Manchester United's Marcus Rashford over poverty campaign - BBC News,"Barack Obama has praised the anti-poverty campaigning of England footballer Marcus Rashford.

In a Zoom meeting, the former United States president told Mr Rashford he was ""way ahead of where I was"" at that age.

The Manchester United footballer has run high-profile campaigns to prevent child hunger and illiteracy in disadvantaged young people across the UK, said: ""When President Obama speaks, all you want to do is listen.""

The former president told Mr Rashford that social movements often started with young people - but the footballer said they often ""don't understand how powerful their voice is"".

He also said that when he was younger he had no expectation of becoming president: ""If I had had more talent I would have probably preferred to be a professional athlete, like Marcus.""

The men, in a meeting set up by the publishers Penguin, discussed the former president's memoir and shared experiences, such as being raised by single mothers and their involvement in community projects.

Russia in 'counter-terror' mode over Ukraine attack | BBC News,"Russia has imposed a ""counter-terrorism operation"" regime in three regions to try to halt a surprise cross-border incursion by Ukrainian troops.

The authorities in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions on the border with Ukraine now can restrict the movement of people and vehicles and use phone tapping among other measures.

This comes as the Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk region is now in its fifth day. Kyiv has not openly admitted the incursion.

The UN nuclear agency has urged Russia and Ukraine to exercise ""maximum restraint"" as fighting nears a nuclear power plant.

SHOES AND SOCKS DIY DESIGN AND HACKS || 32 CLEVER FASHION HACKS,"AMAZING FASHION IDEAS FOR YOUR SHOES

Everyone loves shoes, sometimes even more than clothes, but the way we were them occasionally, might make them look less elegant than they already are. So in this video, I wanted to give you some simple tips and tricks that will make you look stunning. 
Instead of having your socks showing on top of your sneakers, you can fold them right at your ankle, then take them off, slip them inside out, and then wear them as shorter socks. 
I also show you how to make your summer shoes into cute winter heels. Simply wear an old sock on top of them and if you like, cut the fabric exactly where the heel is. If the socks don‚Äôt much the shoes underneath, then keep them as they are.
If you have a thick pair of socks, I show you how to turn them into cute slippers that you can wear around in your home. 
To avoid having your feet cold when you wear summer shoes, you can wear socks and cut them around your toes. This way your toes will be exposed but your feet will stay warm.

Can You Catch Me (Instrumental Version) by Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

They've come under the spotlight in recent weeks amid the ongoing civil unrest.

But one Pakistani Hongkonger says a series of controversial incidents have actually given his community an unexpected chance to promote greater understanding of Hong Kong's diversity.

Now Juan Pablo lives in Brazil and works professionally as a nature sound recordist. In 2014 he won a continent-wide TV contest, Supercerebros (Super Brains), thanks to his exceptional memory of birdsong. BBC News joined Juan Pablo as he went in search of more exotic sounds.

Music:¬†
First song - Struck By You (Ahlstrom Remix) (Instrumental Version) by Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)
Second song - DEAMN - Drive My Car

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020!

"Thai Chinese Food Tour in ENDANGERED CHINATOWN Community in Bangkok, Thailand!","‚ñ∫Check out Michael at Bangkok Vanguards: http://bangkokvanguards.com/
‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Charoen Chai Community (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡πÑ‡∏ä‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä), Bangkok, Thailand.

I‚Äôve known Michael from Bangkok Vanguards (http://bangkokvanguards.com/) for a number of years, and he‚Äôs a great guy. So we met up to hang out, eat, and explore and talk about a little more serious subject - the endangered Charoen Chai Community (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡πÑ‡∏ä‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä) in Bangkok‚Äôs Yaowarat, Chinatown.

Before exploring the neighborhood though, we stopped of course to eat some nearby Thai street food.

Jay Eng (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡πä‡πÄ‡∏≠‡πá‡∏á) - Kuay teow lawd boran (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏î‡πÇ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ì) is what this famous street sells. It‚Äôs an ok dish, not my absolute favorite, but it‚Äôs not a common dish to find in Bangkok either - this old type of style - it‚Äôs well worth trying out. Their fried fish cakes (‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤) are awesome.
Price - 35 THB ($1.07) per plate 

Satay (‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πä‡∏∞) - Next just down the road, and it actually has the same owner, we had some pretty fantastic satay. I especially enjoyed the liver.
Total price - 220 THB ($6.74)

Charoen Chai Community (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡πÑ‡∏ä‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä) - What we really came to explore was Bangkok‚Äôs Charoen Chai Community (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡πÑ‡∏ä‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä). This community is threatened by development. Now, Michael and I both know how development is a good and necessary part of any city, however it‚Äôs also good to preserve amazing living pieces of history. This community is one of the last Thai Chinese communities in Bangkok that has remained almost the same for a hundred years.

Khao Tom Jay Suay (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏à‡πä‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏¢) - For dinner we headed to one of the best Thai Chinese street food restaurant right across the street from the community - right next to the community. It had been a few years since I‚Äôd eaten there and the food was as good as I had remembered.

Asian date mussels (‡∏´‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏≠‡∏°)
Stink beans with shrimp (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡∏™‡∏∞‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á)
Daylilies with crispy pork (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏°‡πâ‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏î‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö)
Silver barb, pickled mustard greens (‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ö‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏â‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢)
Soup with pickled plum (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏à‡∏∑‡∏î‡∏ö‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ö)

Total price - 450 THB ($13.78)

Big thanks to Michael for hanging out and walking around! He offers some very unique and off the beaten path tours of Bangkok which you can check out here: http://bangkokvanguards.com/

Thank you for watching this Thai Chinese food tour of Charoen Chai Community (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡πÑ‡∏ä‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä)!

How ‚Äòbuy nothing‚Äô social media groups help off set code of living crisis - BBC News,"When Sevan Tavoukdjian moved into his own apartment in New York City last month and when he saw how much it would cost to furnish it, he was shocked at the prices being charged.

So, he scrapped plans to buy furniture and instead sent a message to his neighbourhood ‚ÄúBuy Nothing‚Äù Facebook group, where people offer unwanted items for free.

The average American family had to spend roughly $3,500 (¬£2,600) more last year than in 2020 but salaries have not kept up with the increases, pushing people to forego purchases, substitute cheaper alternatives, or - like Sevan - hunt for something free.

Lyrics

Dancing with your silhouette in the places that we met
Ooh, tryna find you in the moon
Paris never feels the same
When the streets all call your name
Ooh, so I hide in crowded rooms

And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

Once upon a time we had it all
Somewhere down the line we went and lost it
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I'm broken here tonight and darling no one else can fix me
Only you, only you
Oh no one else can fix me
Only you, only you, only you
And no one else can fix me
Only you, oh
Only you

Did I let go of your hand for a castle made of sand
Ooh, that fell into the blue
I went following the sun to be alone with everyone
Ooh, looking 'round a crowded room

And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

Once upon a time we had it all (we had it all)
Somewhere down the line we went and lost it (we went and lost it)
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I'm broken here tonight and darling no one else can fix me
Only you, only you
And no one else can fix me
Only you, only you (nobody else)
Only you
And no one else can fix me
Only you, oh
Only you
Falling, falling, yeah
Only you, only you
Only you, only you
And no one else can fix me
Only you (only you)
Only you (only you)
Only you (only you)
And no one else can fix me
Only you

"That's What Will Happen to Earth and Us In¬†1,000¬†Years","Bright Side¬†found out whether our future is¬†doomed or¬†bright ‚Äì here is a list of the most exciting predictions for a¬†new millennium. You could expect super-fast computers, but a house that you can disassemble and put together in a minute? Wow. 

One year ago in his speech at the Oxford University Union, the legendary Stephen Hawking proclaimed that humanity can only survive for another 1,000 years. We wanted to know whether our future is doomed or bright, and so we compiled the most exciting predictions for a new millennium.

TIMESTAMPS
Humans will live for 1,000 years 1:07
We'll be able to transfer our minds to different bodies 2:01
Humans will move to another planet 3:11
We will all look the same 4:35
There will be super-fast intelligent computers 6:11
Humans will become cyborgs 7:05
We will all speak the same global language 8:55
Buildings will assemble and disassemble on command 10:12
Nanotechnology will solve the energy and pollution crisis 11:41

SUMMARY
- In 1,000 years, medical engineers could design remedies for each component that causes tissues to age. Gene editing tools are already here, which could potentially control our genes and make humans immune to a disease.
- In 1,000 years from now, the only way for humanity to survive might be to establish new settlements in space. 
- Humans will develop a larger forehead, larger nostrils, larger eyes, and more pigmented skin.
- In 1,000 years from now, computers are predicted to match and overtake the computational speed of the human brain and solve tasks that take a normal computer a decade to solve.
- In 1,000 years from now, merging with technology might be the only way for humanity to compete with Artificial Intelligence.
- Linguists predict that 100 years from now 90% of languages will disappear due to migration, and those that remain will become simplified. 
- In the future, humans are likely to be able to create a virtual world around them, using the concept of utility fog. 
- 1,000 years from now, nanotechnology will be able to clean up environmental damage, purify water and air, and capture the energy of the Sun.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Gyakie - Far Away (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Gyakie - Far Away (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

In those innocent months that preceded March of 2020, Jackline Acheampong could be found studying at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. This daughter of an acclaimed highlife singer had decided that, although she loved music, the wisest career choice was to ‚Äúbe a businesswoman and get the bag.‚Äù As it so happened for billions around the globe, the next few months changed her short term plans. By summer, she was channeling her pent-up energy back into music, recording an EP under the moniker Gyakie (pronounced ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù). One track in particular stood out: a sticky-sweet vibe called ‚ÄúForever‚Äù that had the soothing and sensual hallmarks many contemporary Afropop hits. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very particular about being a Ghanaian artist,‚Äù says the 22-year-old, who has emphasized that she aims to reveal her range across not only Afrobeats, but also R&B, pop, rock, reggae and jazz. So don‚Äôt be surprised by the crunchy guitars on ‚ÄúWaka Waka,‚Äù or the mid-2000s R&B feel of ‚ÄúFar Away.‚Äù After all, Gyakie is a student at heart, and the key to growth - whether in running a business or making music - is curiosity.

The Future of Driving? | Coding the Car | MotorTrend,"It‚Äôs a little known fact that without software, today‚Äôs cars would not move, let alone perform thousands of functions. The automotive industry is set to change more in the next five years than in the previous 50 years, driven in large part by the arrival of the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV). SDVs are fundamentally altering the relationship between passenger and vehicle with apps and over-the-air software updates, constantly improving safety features, preventing recalls, adding wanted customer features, improving performance and increasing efficiency to create a more sustainable transportation network. 

MotorTrend's Software-Defined Innovator Vehicle Awards looks to celebrate the innovators and companies that ultimately make the average car more intelligent and capable than vehicles on the road today.

Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

'Porn made my boyfriend abuse me' - BBC News,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
A young woman talks about how her boyfriend's pornography habit led to him abusing her when she was 13. A tenth of 12 to 13-year-olds are worried they are addicted to pornographic material according to a new poll by the NSPCC.  Nearly 700 people in that age group were surveyed - 12 percent of them said they had taken part in a sexually explicit video. 
Experts say it is partly down to being able to easily access such material on tablet devices and smart phones. Sima Kotecha spoke to one young woman who said her boyfriend's pornography habit when she was 13 contributed heavily to him abusing her.

Hong Kong protests: Airport cancels flights as thousands occupy - BBC News,"The BBC's Stephen McDonell is in Hong Kong International Airport where departing flights has been cancelled , as anti-government protests in its main terminal continue for a fourth day.
Thousands are gathered at the airport - which is one of the world's busiest.
In a statement, officials said operations had been ""seriously disrupted"" by the public assembly.
Many of those protesting are critical of the actions of police, who on Sunday were caught on film firing tear gas and non-lethal ammunition at close range.
Some protesters are wearing bandages over their eyes in response to images of a woman bleeding heavily from her eye on Sunday, having reportedly been shot by a police projectile.
In a statement on Monday, Hong Kong's Airport Authority said they were cancelling all flights that were not yet checked in. More than 100 flights scheduled after 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) will now not depart.

Motorcycle Mary | 30 for 30 Short,"In the 1950s, Mary McGee found her sense of freedom when she became the first American woman to race motorcycles. Mary‚Äôs pioneering journey of conquering sexism and her own fears paved the way for the next chapter in motorsports.

The untold story of legendary motorsports pioneer Mary McGee a.k.a. MOTORCYCLE MARY whose racing career spanned thirty years and saw Mary shatter gender norms while mastering multiple racing disciplines. Born in Alaska on the eve of World War II, McGee‚Äôs early life is riddled with fear but, with her older brother Jim‚Äôs guidance, she conquers her apprehensive nature and discovers the art of composure‚Äîa skill that serves her to take on the racetrack. Following in her brother‚Äôs footsteps, her remarkable racing odyssey begins in the world of cars, where she outshines her male competitors, only to later discover her greatest sense of freedom racing motorcycles. She was the first woman to race motorcycles in the United States. Confronted by sexism and personal tragedy, Mary perseveres, pushing herself to greater and greater heights‚Äîculminating in her most hair-raising challenge: Becoming the first person ever to solo the grueling Baja 500 on a motorcycle.

The 22-minute documentary short MOTORCYCLE MARY is directed by Haley Watson and produced by Rachel Greenwald and executive produced by two-time Oscar¬Æ winner Ben Proudfoot and seven-time Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton.

Mary McGee died on November 27, 2024 at the age of 87.

That's Why Police Always Wear Blue,"There‚Äôs no short supply of nicknames we have for those who‚Äôve dedicated their lives to upholding the law. No matter which nickname you use, it‚Äôs likely you have a strong image in your mind of what a law enforcement officer looks like. Shiny metal badge, fully stocked duty belt, and, of course, the unmistakable blue uniform. It‚Äôs iconic. 

And like anything so well known, there are reasons it came to be that way. Let‚Äôs look at how police officers became known as ‚Äúthe men and women in blue‚Äù.

SUMMARY:
-In 1829, a guy named Sir Robert Peel introduced ‚ÄúThe Metropolitan Police Act‚Äù to Parliament, forming the first properly trained and paid police department. ‚ÄúBobbies‚Äù, as London Police became known, were given this nickname after Sir Robert.
-The first police forces established in the United States were in major cities. Boston in 1838 and New York in 1845. 
-According to the Los Angeles Police Department, their original uniforms came from surplus Union Army uniforms, which happened to be navy blue. Now in more modern times, it's first of all because of the cleanliness factor. Then there‚Äôs also a basic tactical advantage a dark uniform gives an officer at night as it helps keep them from being easily spotted by the bad guys in certain situations. 
-In a study where people were asked to rank 25 different occupational uniforms by how they made them feel, the police uniform was most consistently linked to feelings of safety. 
-Back in 1969, Menlo Park, California notoriously replaced their traditional navy blues with a forest green sport coat over black pants, a white shirt, and a black tie. Menlo Park continued to dress their police officers like this for 9 years before finally concluding that wearing the same uniform as a local real estate agent didn‚Äôt exactly command the respect they were hoping for. 
-There have been countless psychological tests on how people associate colors with feeling and mood. Black is the color most associated with power and strength, while blue goes along with feelings of trust, security, and comfort. 
-The original slang term for ""policeman"" was ‚Äúcopper‚Äù meaning a person who captures. Five-O doesn‚Äôt simply comes from the American TV show, Hawaii Five-O. ‚ÄúThe Fuzz‚Äù most likely comes from the static heard on a police radio.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Auschwitz remembered:  80 years on survivors deliver warning from history | BBC News,"Ceremonies have taken place  to mark 80 years since the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland by the Soviet Red Army.
 
More than a million people, most of them Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz, the largest ever mass execution of human beings.  
 
About 50 survivors returned to the site to lay wreaths and candles and give speeches at the commemoration service.
 
World leaders also attended the ceremony.  The Polish President Andrzej Duda said his country would always preserve the terrible memory of Auschwitz ""in order to never let it happen again"".

Fiona Bruce presents BBC News at Ten coverage of the ceremony, hearing first-hand testimony and with reports by Katya Adler, Daniela Relph, and Steve Rosenberg.

Activists celebrate Argentina vote to legalise abortion - BBC News,"Argentina‚Äôs Congress has voted to legalise abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy. Senators voted with 38 in favour, 29 against, with one abstention. Activists have campaigned for years on the issue with crowds gathered on the streets of Buenos Aires to hear the result of the vote. The Catholic Church opposed the bill and had called on senators to reject the bill. Until now, abortions have only been allowed in cases of rape or if the health of the mother was at risk.

The glasses test you can do at home - BBC News,"A Silicon Valley start-up has developed a smartphone accessory that lets owners check their vision at home.

The results produced by EyeQue's Visioncheck gadget can be used to order new glasses from many retailers.

However, because a prescription is needed to purchase contact lenses in the US, there are limitations on its use there.

The BBC's Cody Godwin tried out the innovation at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.

""I Will Carry You"" 
Written by: Ellie Holcomb and Ben Glover
Lyrics:
I know you‚Äôre tired , I see it in your eyes
All that anxiety that rules your mind 
I‚Äôll be your shield when you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôve got strength enough to fight 
I‚Äôll stand by your side

I will carry you 
through your darkest nights
When you‚Äôre terrified 
I will carry you 
When the water‚Äôs rise 
When your Hope runs dry 
I will carry you 

You are not the sum of your mistakes 
You don‚Äôt have to hide the parts of you that ache
I choose you as you are a million times 
Cause I‚Äôm not ashamed of you , 
I won‚Äôt walk away from you 

 I will carry you 
through your darkest nights
When you‚Äôre terrified 
I will carry you 
When the water‚Äôs rise 
When your Hope runs dry 
I will carry you 

Up and over the mountains
Valley deep as the ocean
And when you can‚Äôt keep going 
I will shoulder your burdens",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBGb5jG5v3Y

Why Are Firetrucks Red?,"Everything about a firetruck makes us stop and look at it. They‚Äôre big, bright, loud, and they carry brave people who save lives. But have you ever wondered why they‚Äôre red? The answer isn‚Äôt 100% clear, but there are a few theories out there.

By the way, other colors have also been used for them. Studies have shown that while that red hue reaches our eyes first in the daytime, it‚Äôs not best for at night. When it‚Äôs dark out, our eyes are better at seeing colors with a smaller wavelength like greens and blues. So some cities have adopted one of these colors for their firetrucks instead of the traditional crimson! Other places have even more surprising colors like orange, pink, yellow, and lime green!

SUMMARY:
- The earliest fire departments in the 1800s were made up of volunteer firefighters. Back then, red was the cheapest color of paint you could buy, so they went with the budget-friendly option.
- Another theory says that back when fire departments ran on volunteers, there was a lot of pride and competition between departments from town to town. Red was the most sought-after color because it‚Äôs bold and catches the eye. 
- Fire departments wanted their trucks to stand out among the thousands of dark vehicles and wagons on the road. 
- Fire extinguishers, hydrants, STOP signs and lights ‚Äì they‚Äôre all bright red like a cherry.
- Red has the highest wavelength of all the other colors of the rainbow, so our brain registers it first. 
- Back in the days when fire engines were pulled by horses, a dalmatian would run ahead of them and bark loudly to clear the path. 
- The earliest fire engine was from Ancient Greece. It was only a large pump in an aqueduct system that shot water, but the concept evolved in Ancient Greece. 
- The fire engine is what brings the pumps and hoses to the scene, while the truck delivers all the ladders in case they‚Äôre needed. 
- Firefighters are trained to go up sky-high on these ladders. But no worries ‚Äì they‚Äôre built to remain stable in 50 mph winds!
- Depending on what equipment it carries and how big the firetruck is, they cost between $500,000 and $1,000,000!
- The fastest firetruck in the world is called the Hawaiian Eagle, and it holds the record for the fastest firetruck in existence, and it can reach speeds of up to 407 mph.
- Surprisingly, the average firetruck only has around 500 horsepower! 
-It‚Äôs a little-known fact that the flashing lights and super loud siren are on the fire engine, not the truck.

Thousands stranded after being freed from Myanmar's scam centres | BBC News,"Thousands of former workers who have been freed from telecom fraud centres on the Thai-Myanmar border are now stranded in makeshift camps.
 
The labourers - from countries around the world - were lured to these centres by fake promises of good jobs.
 
The armed militia groups who are now holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
 
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the people are in poor health.

Thai Khao Tom and Seafood Street Food (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Æ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤),"‚ñ∫Get more details about eating at this restaurant in Bangkok here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/07/bangkok-seafood-restaurant-hia-wan-khao-tom-pla/

Hia Wan Khao Tom Pla (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Æ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤) is an excellent restaurant in Bangkok that specializes in serving khao to pla, which is rice soup with fish. As opposed to congee, which is more like a porridge, khao tom is a rice that‚Äôs fully cooked, but then boiled in soup, so the grains of rice remain in tact instead of getting stick like in congee. To begin our meal at Hia Wan Khao Tom Pla (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Æ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤)I had the Khao tom pla gao (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πã‡∏≤), Thai rice soup with brown marbled grouper. The thing I immediately noticed is that the fish was very fresh - it had no fishy taste, and the fish was firm and had a wonderful flavor. Additionally, the sauce was also very good, made with fermented soy beans.

Next we tried their goong ob woon sen (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô), mung bean noodles cooked with shrimp in a little personal pan. It‚Äôs not the best version that I‚Äôve had in Bangkok, but it was still pretty good - and the shrimp were giant in size, which made the dish even better. The shrimp dipped in the Thai seafood sauce was fantastic. We also tried their tom yum pla kapong (‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏á), tom yum soup made with fresh pieces of barramundi. Just like the rice soup, the tom yum was very fresh and the pieces of fish were firm and delicious. But the actual soup was a little on the sweet side for me - still good and I especially just liked the big pieces of fish.

Finally, the best dish for me, along with the khao tom, was the Luak jim ruam mit (‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏î‡∏à‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏°‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£), a dish of a variety of seafood just boiled and topped with a handful of crispy garlic and Chinese celery. It‚Äôs a plain dish, and then you just take the seafood and dip it into the Thai seafood sauce for flavor. The dish was excellent, all the seafood was extremely fresh.

Everything that Hia Wan Khao Tom Pla (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Æ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤) serves is on the plain side, and so the freshness of the seafood really can‚Äôt be covered up by anything. So you can be assured that they serve fresh seafood, and they do a good job at serving what they do. I really liked all the fish, and the seafood sauce to go with is.

Again, be sure to check out the full blog post for more details about eating at this restaurant in Bangkok: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/07/bangkok-seafood-restaurant-hia-wan-khao-tom-pla/

New Zealand blasts James Blunt and Baby Shark at Covid rule protesters - BBC News,"In an attempt to disperse protesters from outside New Zealand‚Äôs parliament, authorities have taken to playing music.

After Barry Manilow's greatest hits on a loop failed to dislodge the anti-vaccine mandate demonstration, which has been sat outside for almost a week, they turned to a song which strikes fear into the hearts of parents around the world: Baby Shark (doo doo doo).

They even joined a sing-along to James Blunt's 2005 hit, You're Beautiful.

As of Monday however, protesters have not been moved, with hundreds still remaining outside parliament.

26 BRILLIANT HACKS FOR YOUR GARDEN THAT WILL COST YOU LESS THAN A DOLLAR,"HOW TO GROW ANYTHING AT HOME WITHOUT ANY EFFORT

In this video, I have the best gardening tips and tricks you can try at home. You don‚Äôt need to put much effort into them. For some of them, you just have to take the seeds out fruits and in a few weeks,  you have your own plants or veggies. 
You can take the seeds from a pumpkin regrow and your own pumpkin plant simply by adding some soil to it and then watering it with a spray bottle.  
To grow a papaya plant from scratch, simply take the fruit and remove all its seeds. Place them in water and the ones that move at the bottom, you can take those and plant them in soil Water them frequently and voila. 
Some of the veggies I show you have to be germinated first. That means, they need to stay in a dark wet place for a few days or weeks in order to make roots. Peanuts, for example, need to be dipped in water and then placed in a paper towel for a few days before planting them. When you see the roots being longer than 3cm then it‚Äôs time to transfer them in soil. 
To grow your own tomato plant simple cut the tomatoes in thin slices, place them in soil, and then cover them up with some more soil. After that water them frequently and voila.

Inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule - BBC News,"A new astronaut capsule, which launched on Saturday from Florida on a Falcon rocket, has successfully guided itself into the International Space Station using computers and sensors.

Astronauts on board ISS have now been inside the capsule.
The Dragon SpaceX demonstration flight vehicle will stay docked until 8 March when it will detach and drop to Earth.

It will have to come through its descent unscathed so that Nasa can approve its readiness to carry people, which could happen as early as July.

Yep, it needs to be done and it needs to be done right, but it‚Äôs certainly not as exciting as dropping in big parts like the engine. Our goal for today, and it will happen before anyone leaves our MotorTrend Tech Center, is to have the body mated to the chassis.

SIMPLE ACTS OF KINDNESS,"HOW TO BE KIND TO EVERYONE 

Being kind and returning kindness takes some time to master. Not all of us are constantly in the mood to be cheerful and help others but doing the littlest things that will put a smile on people‚Äôs faces is very emotionally rewarding. 
If someone is homeless in the street, chances are, they‚Äôre also hungry. So why not buy them some lunch and a coffee or a drink? 
If you see people littering, try to pick up the garbage and then put it in the bin. You can use a plastic bag and do your little bit of saving the environment. That‚Äôs because when little birds see garbage and other stuff on the floor, they will go eat whatever they find, including plastic bags. 
When you see a homeless person without any shoes, try to help them by purchasing new ones for them. This will keep their feet warm and dry.

While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

"Qatar ""should not be apologetic"" for hosting World Cup, tournament chief says - BBC News","The state of Qatar has said it has ""nothing to apologise for"" in hosting the 2022 men's football World Cup, amid controversy over the country's human rights record.

The country has strict anti-LGBTQ+ laws and there are concerns over the treatment of those working on infrastructure projects for the tournament.

Hassan Al-Thawadi, the general secretary of the Qatar 2022 tournament, told the BBC that criticism by some players and managers has been ""ill-informed"".

The draw for November's tournament takes place on 1 April.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Blige and Paul Play fan ultimately settled in Canada, where Toronto‚Äôs influential R&B scene provided fertile ground for deeper artistic growth. Ultimately, Nonso‚Äôs globetrotting helped nurture his core goal: to fuse Western groove music with trad African sounds, rhythms, and vibes. ‚ÄúI want to make great songs that tell my story,‚Äù says the ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù singer. That irresistible 2016 track got passed around in Afro-R&B circles, its gauzy synths, delicate dembow riddim, and celestial vocals crafting a template for Nonso‚Äôs future output. As the decade ended, Afropop and Alt√© had reached a groundswell in Nigeria. Nonso‚Äôs name was in lots of mouths back home. His ‚ÄòFree‚Äô EP fueled the fire. Tracks such as ‚ÄúNo Crime‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat Makes You Sure?‚Äù emphasized lyrical honesty and softly-woven textures. Afrobeats titan Mr. Eazi hopped on ‚ÄúGo Outside‚Äù further cementing Nonso‚Äôs cred. By 2020, he had racked up more than 100 million streams across music platforms. Wisely, he has guided his ascent on the other side of the Atlantic with tranquility and deliberateness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to be a bridge connecting African music and to the rest of the world,‚Äù he said about the importance of being part of our Artists to Watch 2023 class. When Nonso tells his stories, you can‚Äôt help but stop what you‚Äôre doing and listen.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

US to send jets and warships as Iran threatens Israel | BBC News,"The US will deploy additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said.

Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Fuad Shukr, a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented.

Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel after the assassination of Haniyeh.

Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was ""ironclad"".

Why Millions of New Cars Are Left Abandoned,"Places full of unwanted things and even whole cities void of people are actually real, and there are some surprising reasons for their existence. There are many places in the world where perfectly new, unsold cars pile up like garbage in areas even larger than airports. Why? The answer is: the overproduction crisis. 

TIMESTAMPS
New cars 0:21
Taxis 1:57
Bicycles 2:37
Buses 3:38
Trains 4:22
Red phone booths 4:54
Cities 5:32

#abandonedcars #abandonedcity #brightside

SUMMARY
- There are more cars produced than buyers who will purchase them, and since factories can‚Äôt give them out for free they toss them aside to make room for new production. Ironically, they can‚Äôt just stop producing new cars, because that would mean firing a lot of workers and running out of business.
- Some taxi graveyards have hundreds of cars, like the one in Chongqing, China that looks like a yellow sea from above. Others have dozens of cars parked in all the wrong places and causing discomfort to city dwellers like the illegal taxi graveyard in Queens.
- You can see impressive-looking bicycle graveyards all across China. It‚Äôs not that the Chinese hate using bikes and decided to dispose of them in such a merciless way. In 2017, the bike-sharing business took off in China. 
- Some of the old buses become a shelter for the homeless, others are turned into art objects adorned with graffiti. Someone in Ontario who had quite a few of them at their disposal lined them up and made a fence out of them. 
- Some train cars get rusty or are somehow defective and simply await repairs. Others are left to rot because they used to run on railroads that no longer exist. This is the case with the West Branch Railroad in Maine, for example. 
- It‚Äôs not only vehicles get abandoned and pile up. Just as British as tea and double-deckers, the iconic red phone booths also end up in the middle of nowhere these days. 
- Can you imagine whole cities getting abandoned? And I‚Äôm not talking about little villages somewhere in the mountains. The capital of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat, for instance, is built of marble and looks majestic but is basically a ghost town.

Shelby GT350: A Carroll Shelby Legacy - Pebble Beach Week,"One of the classes at this year's 65th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Shelby GT350. 

The Shelby GT350 was the result of a unique collaboration between the Ford Motoring Company and Carroll Shelby. Starting in 1965 in a factory in Southern California, Shelby took semi-compleeted Mustangs and boosted them from 271 to 306 horsepower, mated that to a close ratio transmission from his Cobra, and added heavy duty suspension parts and a fiberglass hood. 

The Shelby GT350 featured in this video is a great barn find that was originally sold by Galpin Ford and has made its way back to the dealership. Motor Trend's Angus MacKenzie stops by Galpin Ford to admire this rare example of an untouched original. 

Tune in to Motor Trend On Demand and the Motor Trend Youtube Channel Sunday August 16th @ 4pm EST for LIVE coverage of the 65th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.

Lyrics: 
I was a lost cause
Still you calling me a friend despite all
my flaws
Tried to do it on my own, but it was my loss
Need You desperately I can‚Äôt pretend
Okay it‚Äôs my scars in the palm of Your hands
You turn my heart gold it was a stone back then
I was a lost soul, gave me a reason to breathe again

All along
It was You that I was missing
Now I found the One
Like a psalm, You breathe new life into my lungs

I need You like some oxygen
Promise that You‚Äôll always keep me close and won‚Äôt let go
Bring me back to life again
You‚Äôre the only one that can revive all these dry bones bones bones
Keep me close and don‚Äôt let go go go

I gotta couple hunnid things in life I don‚Äôt understand
But I don‚Äôt gotta have it all to know to trust in Your plan
I know Your word is like a light onto my path to show me where to go

You stay providing all my needs just like it be on demand
You keep my head above, won‚Äôt ever let me sink in the sand
I run to You when life gets hard, I haven‚Äôt found a better way to cope

And it can be hard to define love
But when You come around, it don‚Äôt take much
I let down my guard and put my trust in You we‚Äôre locked in I‚Äôm never leaving
And it can be hard to define love
But when You come around, it don‚Äôt take much
I let down my guard and put my trust in You we‚Äôre locked in I‚Äôm never leaving

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

The Babies Teaching Kindness in Class - BBC News,"Naomi isn‚Äôt your average teacher. For one thing, she‚Äôs only 7 months old. But in many schools across Canada babies like Naomi are a regular feature at the front of class. It‚Äôs because of an education programme called Roots of Empathy, which is designed to encourage kids to be kinder. The idea is that because a baby can‚Äôt explain and externalise how it‚Äôs feeling, children learn to recognise and identify the baby‚Äôs emotions, and become more emotionally astute themselves. It‚Äôs been proven to reduce bullying. World Hacks visits a school in Toronto to see how it works.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward.

South Korea court begins impeachment trial of suspended president | BBC News,"South Korea's Constitutional Court has held its first hearing to decide if suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol should be removed from office after his shock martial law attempt last month.
 
The hearing ended within four minutes because of Yoon's absence - his lawyers had earlier said he would not attend for his own safety, as there is a warrant out for his arrest on separate charges of insurrection.
 
In December, Yoon was suspended after members of his own party voted with the opposition to impeach him.
 
However he will only be formally removed from office if at least six of the eight-member Constitutional Court bench votes to uphold the impeachment.

State of the Union: Trump announces second North Korea summit - BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has announced in his State of the Union speech that he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month.
In an address to the nation with the theme ""Choosing Greatness"", he vowed once again to build a border wall.
While appealing for political unity, the Republican president also said ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" could damage US prosperity.
In a rebuttal, Democrats accused Mr Trump of abandoning US values.
His primetime address came less than a fortnight after he backed down to end the longest ever US government shutdown when Democrats refused to fund a US-Mexico border wall.

But the flare and skill of fireworks today wouldn't exist, without some simple, but clever, chemistry.

So how do fireworks work exactly? How are they made ‚Äì and how do they get their different colours?

Dr Joanna Buckley invited the BBC to the chemistry laboratories at the University of Sheffield to take a closer look at the science behind fireworks.

WHO ARE KARA AND NATE?! 
New here? We are full-time travel vloggers with a goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019. We make daily travel videos. In these videos you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit. ;)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

South Sudan 'dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oil | BBC News,"Large swathes of South Sudan have been under water for several years after unprecedented flooding, which scientists say has been worsened by climate change.
 
In recent years, these climate-driven floods have mixed with oil.
 
South Sudan is the world‚Äôs youngest country and one of its poorest, with a government hugely dependent on oil revenue.
 
Health professionals and politicians in the area have told the BBC they fear pollution and the lack of clean water are taking a toll on human health.
 
The BBC asked the oil consortium GPOC and the South Sudanese president‚Äôs office to comment on the allegations in this report, but they did not respond.

It comes after the US president gave guidelines to governors on reopening state economies.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Is China a big spender or a loan shark? - BBC News,"China hands out twice as much development money as the US and other major powers, new evidence shows, with most of it coming in the form of risky high-interest loans from Chinese state banks.

Over 18 years, China has granted or loaned money to 13,427 infrastructure projects worth $843bn across 165 countries, according to research.

Much of this money is linked to the Belt and Road strategy, which uses China's expertise in infrastructure projects to build new global trading routes.

Critics fear that the high-interest loans funding many Chinese projects are saddling unsuspecting populations in sky-high debt.

CLEAN FREAKS || 21 ECO-FRIENDLY CLEANING TIPS TO TRY AT HOME,"GENIUS CLEANING HACKS TO SPEED UP YOUR ROUTINE

Cleaning your home can be one of the most satisfying things in the world. But sometimes, it takes time and effort. So, in this video, I show you some cleaning DIY and recipes to make your whole routine easier. 
Instead of using a cloth, you can use a newspaper to clean your windows. It absorbs most of the liquid and doesn‚Äôt leave patches or smudge stains.
You can clean your bathtub with some grapefruit and baking soda. It removes all the build-up and it‚Äôs also all-natural.
You can also remove dirt from furniture or from walls using a piece of slime. 
To avoid limescale from building up in your bathroom faucet, simply coat it with some wax and then distribute it all around using a cloth. It will create a limescale-resistant coat. 
To remove burned food from a frying pan, sprinkle some salt and then press it around with a potato. It will dissolve all the food and your pan will be good as new.

Lyrics:
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right
It's all right, hmm

So many times has it all been said and done
But in the end it's the fight that's just begun
Understand that it's days like these
When the world is so hard to please
It knew my heart has find a home

'Cause it's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two
'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are born
Yeah we are, we are, we are, we are born

Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together

These games they will always end the same
'Cause neither you or I will take the blame
Oh, sometimes we go too far
But I like it the way we are
Right here I give your heart a home

No it's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two
'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are born
Yeah we are, we are, we are, we are born

Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together

It's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two
'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are born
Yeah, we are, we are, we are, we are born

Hong Kong residents respond to controversial security law - BBC News,"Hong Kong residents have shared their feelings about a new national law, planned by China's ruling Communist Party.

China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in Hong Kong.

The law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress, which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year.

Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce such a law after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after 500,000 people took to the streets.

Now, after a wave of sustained protests in Hong Kong last year, Beijing is attempting to push the law through.

Critics say the law would strip Hong Kong of the rights it currently enjoys, that are not seen in mainland China.

It is seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms.

Is There An Ethical Diet?,"What if aliens were plant based life? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice explore the bias we have towards other species and kingdoms, from an outside lense. 

Why do we prefer to kill one animal over another? Is there such thing as an ethical mousetrap? Plus, we break down what it would be like for plant-based sentient life to watch us on Earth. What would they think of the produce section of the grocery store? What would they think of the fact we don‚Äôt photosynthesize for food?

FloyyMenor - Gata Only (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"FloyyMenor - Gata Only | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

La ciudad costera de La Serena en Chile no necesariamente es conocida por su escena de m√∫sica urbana, pero FloyyMenor lleg√≥ a cambiar esto r√°pidamente. La carrera del reggaetonero de 18 a√±os comenz√≥ apenas en el 2023 con ‚ÄúPa‚Äô la Europa‚Äù, canci√≥n que le trajo al chileno inter√©s internacional. Pero, nadie pudo predecir el √©xito masivo de ‚ÄúGATA ONLY‚Äù. Lanzada a principios del 2024, la colaboraci√≥n con Cris Mj caus√≥ un bullicio y arras√≥ con las listas de reproducci√≥n hasta llegar llegar al #1 en la lista Hot Latin Songs de Billboard. La colaboraci√≥n permaneci√≥ 13 semanas consecutivas en la lista, haciendo de Floyy el primer artista chileno en llevarse el reconocimiento desde 1999. No es para menos, ya que su fusi√≥n de ritmos de trap, reggaet√≥n y m√∫sica tropical atraen los cuerpos a la pista de baile, y sus letras son poderosas, con mucha indirecta hacia la fiesta, el sexo y la vida callejera. El flow de la futura estrella de reggaet√≥n es hipn√≥tico y su presentaci√≥n tiene un estilazo inigualable. Todo esto, adem√°s de su audiencia en crecimiento, fue suficiente para poner a Floyy en nuestro radar para el programa DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025. Su disposici√≥n carism√°tica y su compromiso con llevar el reggaet√≥n chileno a una nueva estratosfera a trav√©s de la colaboraci√≥n le gan√≥ un espacio en nuestra lista. Como el abanderado del g√©nero en su pa√≠s, nos coment√≥ que est√° ‚Äúemocionado por continuar rompiendo r√©cords y representando al talento chileno‚Äù mundialmente. Estamos aqu√≠ para ayudarle a hacer exactamente esta labor.   

The coastal city of La Serena, Chile isn‚Äôt necessarily known for its m√∫sica urbana scene, but FloyyMenor will change that very quickly. The 18-year old‚Äôs career took off in 2023 with ‚ÄúPa‚Äô la Europa,‚Äù which garnered international attention, but no one could‚Äôve predicted the massive success of ‚ÄúGATA ONLY‚Äù. Released in early 2024, the boisterous collaboration with Cris MJ burned through the charts to take the #1 spot on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Latin Songs for a whopping 13 consecutive weeks, making Floyy the first Chilean artist to snatch the achievement since 1999. This isn‚Äôt a fluke. Floyy‚Äôs fusion of reggaeton, trap and tropical music beckons party goers to the dancefloor, and his lyrics are punchy and filled with innuendo. The future reggaeton star‚Äôs hypnotic delivery, suave performance style, and ever-growing audience were enough to put him on our DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025 radar. But it‚Äôs his charismatic demeanor and commitment to take Chilean reggaeton to great heights via collaboration with fellow young artists that earned him a spot on the list. As the torchbearer for the genre in his country, he told us he‚Äôs ‚Äúexcited to continue breaking records and representing Chilean talent‚Äù worldwide. We‚Äôre here to help him do just that.

Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes' - BBC News,"Donald Trump paid just $750 (¬£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says.

The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades - also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.
The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says.
Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"".
""Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,"" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday.

""The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me well‚Ä¶ they treat me very badly,"" he said.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel¬†but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

21 Places to Hide Stuff You‚Äôve Never Thought Of,"So you‚Äôre going on vacation for a while. What‚Äôs your go-to hiding place for your valuables? Maybe at the bottom of your cereal boxes? How about your freezer drawers? Perhaps you‚Äôre stacking some money in your toilet tank? These might seem like excellent spots to keep your possessions, but unfortunately, robbers already know about them. 

According to recent statistics, there are approximately 3.7 million home burglaries every year in the US alone. And even though the numbers are growing by the day, the hidey-holes haven‚Äôt gotten any more creative. Thieves tend to spend an of average 8 to 12 minutes in each property they break into, and they know exactly where to look.

#protectyourself #safety #brightside

SUMMARY:
- The first room that a thief will thoroughly scan is the master bedroom. So, mattresses, closets, drawers and even suitcases are off limits for hiding.
- The toilet tank, and medicine cabinet are also very common treasure spots. 
- Take a cheap-looking clock and, using tape, attach anything valuable you might have that fits into the space behind it.
- Take small containers, and fill them with either your cash, passports, cards or jewelry ‚Äì you know the gist. Seal them on top and place them inside a tub of unused cat litter. 
- You can use a medicine bottle (which is watertight) to place your money or other important items inside. 
- Sometimes, the best hiding spots are the ones out in the open. So, a household item like your vacuum cleaner is the perfect safe. 
- Between nearly all upper cupboards there‚Äôs a tiny gap. It‚Äôs not visible unless you climb on the kitchen counters. Since not many people know about them, they‚Äôre the perfect hidey holes for cash.
- The cavities under the kitchen cabinets are so huge that you can hide all sorts of things inside, even hard-drives.
- No robber will go through the paint containers in your garage to find money. Remember, they only have a few minutes to search, and garages aren‚Äôt their priority.
- For your jewelry, a tennis ball is your perfect mini vault ‚Äì and it takes no time to create either.
- Burglars don‚Äôt have the time to check all the outlets in someone‚Äôs home for hidden wall safes. Interestingly, there are small containers that look like outlets on the outside, but on the inside they serve a different purpose. 
- Let‚Äôs face it, a family album is one of the best places to hide money. Even family members don‚Äôt check them. 
- Remember in Breaking Bad, when Walter White hid all of his money in his daughters‚Äô room? He sure knew what he was doing. One of the most secure places in someone‚Äôs house is in the kids‚Äô room. 
- Speaking of kids and their rooms, an ideal place to stash cash is inside a baby wipes container. Oh so you mean unused ones!  Remove the internal pack but keep a couple of wipes on top and then layer the bills underneath.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award¬Æ-winning director Pete Docter (‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.,‚Äù ‚ÄúUp‚Äù) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs original movie ‚Äú Inside Out,‚Äù he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all‚Äîinside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions ‚Äì Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley‚Äôs mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUx8iSH0hc4

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

What If There's No Internet for 24 Hours,"It‚Äôs 7 am, and the sound of your alarm wakes you up. You reach over to the nightstand to pick up your phone. With your eyes half-closed, you notice you don‚Äôt have any new notifications. Hmm, that‚Äôs weird. You get up, grab a quick shower, and head downstairs.

After you‚Äôve gotten some breakfast and coffee, you grab your tablet and see the same thing: no notifications. You also notice there‚Äôs no Internet connection. It wasn‚Äôt just on your phone but all your devices. Before checking your router, you try the old ‚Äúturn it off and on again‚Äù technique. Of course, that didn‚Äôt help. So, you head over to the router and see a blinking red light. The 4G isn‚Äôt working either.

SUMMARY:
- You decide to take a cab ‚Äì maybe it‚Äôll save some time. You automatically open the app on your phone. Oh yeah, it doesn‚Äôt work.
- You notice the people around you for the first time. They‚Äôre all looking at their phones in frustration, some have even struck up a conversation.
- When you finally get to your office building. You reach for your card without even thinking. But guess what! That doesn‚Äôt work either. 
- Right from the get-go, you‚Äôre already not that surprised to hear the talk of the day, ‚ÄúInternet‚Äôs down.‚Äù 
- You can‚Äôt send any emails or reports, and you can‚Äôt download anything.
- With the office becoming more of a circus with every passing minute, the boss decides to let everyone just take the day off.
- You can‚Äôt remember how much money you have in the bank, and there‚Äôs no way to check. 
- That‚Äôs when it hits you: what about all your pictures, videos, and data? You had your whole graduation video on the cloud. All those pictures of your backpacking trip across Europe? Are all the memories lost? 
- You take 400 bucks out of your account to keep yourself afloat. Who knows if it‚Äôll be enough ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way of knowing how long this nightmare will last! 
- Airports are at a standstill, along with ships, trains, and commercial trucking. Panic has broken out in major cities.
- You ask a passerby if there are any little family-owned stores in the area. They don‚Äôt have a lot, but you grab whatever you can carry in two hands and head home. 
- As you walk, you start thinking about how everything you do revolves around the Internet.
- Since you can‚Äôt stream anything, you decide to watch good old-fashioned TV channels filled with old movies and shows. 
- At about 10pm, you fall asleep to the thought that you‚Äôll face the same chaos tomorrow, and you‚Äôre already stressed about work. 
- You wake up to multiple notification sounds on your phone, and as you turn over, your screen is flashing with pop-up boxes left and right. 
- Phones all across the city ‚Äì across the globe! ‚Äì are lighting up as if on command. You take a look and let out a sigh of relief: the world is back online! Phew!

What Parallel Worlds Might Look Like,"But have you ever wondered what parallel worlds might look like? Yes, the existence of parallel universes has not yet been proven, but why we can't have some fun in the meanwhile? Let's imagine that there's a way to travel between universes in the multiverse. Or maybe that a glitch in the matrix happened and traveling to parallel universes became possible.

The theory of multiple or parallel universes is one that blurs the line between scientific reality and science fiction. It‚Äôs a pretty huge topic of debate in the scientific community, with big names on both sides. This is the idea that everything you thought you ever knew ‚Äì our planet, the solar system, our galaxy, all the other stars and galaxies out there as far as our fancy telescopes can see ‚Äì it‚Äôs just one itsy bitsy piece of a really giant puzzle!

üòΩ Btw, guys, we don't know if there are cats in parallel worlds but there are a few cats hidden in this video. Can you spot them all? üòΩ

Hot Milk - Bloodstream (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Hot Milk - Bloodstream (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Ready to meet your new favorite rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll duo? Hot Milk are fronted by Hannah Mee and Jim Shaw, two stalwarts of Manchester‚Äôs revitalized music scene. They swiped right on each other a couple years back, but soon found that their true connection was a musical one. In 2019, their debut EP ‚ÄòAre You Alive?‚Äô arrived flush with the bombast of glam rock, flawless production of mid 00s pop punk, and vulnerable lyrics about mental health and social issues. Because they were such champions of Manchester‚Äôs formidable scene (there‚Äôs a rumor they inhabited a Gallagher bro‚Äôs apartment), Jim and Han received tons of support from the get go. BBC happily spun their mascara-tinged power pop. You Me At Six brought them on tour. ‚ÄúJ does everything in this band,‚Äù Han recently praised her bandmate. Love the positive vibes, but Mee shouldn‚Äôt sell herself short: she boasts shades of Joan Jett stage presence and a twinkle of Hayley Williams‚Äô vocal prowess. Fans of Bring Me The Horizon and Paramore will def like what they see in these DSCVR performances, both tracks from their upcoming debut, ‚ÄòA CALL TO THE VOID.‚Äô If they sound extra tight it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been touring nonstop the last few years, hitting festival stages and supporting the likes of Pale Waves and blackbear. Plus they have their own headline tour this fall, and plenty more festival dates this summer. See you in the mosh pit.

Lyrics - BLOODSTREAM

Living in my bloodstream.

Where the hell did we die last night?
Burning up in the new daylight,
back from the dark side again. 

Did the blackhole spit us out?
Bitter taste left in its mouth.
If that's not the last time then when.

Coz I tie the noose round everything,
when I lace my drink and let it in,
turn my friends to enemies,
disassociate with me.

One more night and I will let you go,
now your living in my bloodstream, living in my bloodstream,
try to stop but I just can't say no,
coz you're living in my bloodstream

living in my bloodstream
 
Seeing shapes that don't exist,
kaleidoscope of the abyss,
soaked in all last nights champagne,
coz when the comedown comes around,
my frontal lobe is checking out,
baptise me in acid rain,

Now I'm looking for some peace of mind,
as a piece of me was left behind,
my veins go into overdrive,
disassociate with me

One more night and I will let you go,
now your living in my bloodstream, living in my bloodstream,
try to stop but I just can't say no,
coz you're living in my bloodstream
living in my bloodstream

(living in my bloodstream)

Coz I tie the noose round everything,
when I lace my drink and let it in,
turn my friends to enemies,
disassociate with me.
 
One more night and I will let you go, (let you go)
now you're living in my bloodstream, living in my bloodstream,
try to stop but I just can't say no, (can't say no)
coz you're living in my bloodstream
living in my bloodstream

coz you're living in my bloodstream

living in my bloodstream

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer cuts foreign aid budget to boost defence spending | BBC News,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as peace talks to end the war in Ukraine gather pace.
 
The PM said he would cut the UK's international aid budget to fund the rise in defence spending, which is currently 2.3% of GDP.
 
Opposition parties welcomed the move to spend more on defence but the aid cuts were branded ""a betrayal"" by charities.
 
The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Starmer and US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.

LYRICS:
I've been waitin' for breakthrough, I've been prayin' for change
I know You'll work it all for good but how long will it take
I've been asking for healing and I'm not gonna lie
I'm ready for the miracle, God, let it be this time
 
But if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong

 
God, You taught me to trust You, You showed me how to believe
You're the author and the finisher of what You start in me
So I'm not gonna doubt it, I'm gonna hold onto peace
'Cause if I have You and nothing else, I still have everything
 
'Cause if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
 
I'll count it joy when I am tested
'Cause You bring beauty from my pain, it's never wasted
 
But if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
Will stay strong

Lyrics:
Caught out, sleeping around
He says it's nothing with her lipstick down his mouth
And you might think he doesn't care that much at all
But they always come back
Yeah, they always come back

When he returns he puts you in a situation
But it's too late to have that kinda conversation
It's not your job to show this boy some education, no
Now ain't it funny how we never seem to work it out

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take that pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back
They're all the same, they never learn
So, dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back

Dry your eyes Mr. Wise Guy
But take a picture, it's the last that you will see
Let's see how far this guy gets walking on his own feet
But they'll always come back
Yeah, they always come back

When he returns he puts you in a situation
But it's too late to have that kinda conversation
It's not your job to show this boy some education, no
Now ain't it funny how we never seem to work it out

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take that pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back
They're all the same, they never learn
So, dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back

Wow, oh, yeah
(Now let the motherfucker burn)
Oh, let it burn
(Now let the motherfucker burn)
Woah, yeah
(Now let the motherfucker burn)

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take that pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take that pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back
Yeah, they always come back

They're all the same, they never learn
So, dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they'll always come back
Yeah, they'll always come back

Sled Pull and Awards Ceremony - Diesel Power Challenge 2017,"On the final day of Diesel Power Challenge 2017 Presented by XDP, each of our 10 competitors hooked their truck to the pulling sled, and attempted to drag it as far as possible across a track created at Bandimere Speedway. After the final pull, we wrapped-up the weeklong competition with a banquet, where specialty awards were presented, podium finishers named, and, for the second-straight year, Charlie Keeter accepted the First Place trophy for being the overall Diesel Power Challenge champion.
Starting October 9th, 2017, 2017, host Brian Lohnes takes you through our weeklong torture test that features 6 competitive events, 10 trucks, and 23,172.2 combined horsepower and torque at the rear wheels. We push Cummins-, Duramax-, and Power Stroke‚Äìpowered trucks well beyond their limits in this search for the ultimate street-legal diesel truck and driver.

SUMMARY
- Goose bumps form when tiny muscles at the base of hair follicles contract. In the animal kingdom, this helps them warm up faster by standing each hair on end and creating a sort of insulation. 
- Other people hear the soundwaves of your voice coming only through the air, and a recording also contains just these sounds. Yet the way we hear our own voices is a combination of the regular sounds and the low-frequency sounds conducted by the bones of our skulls. 
- When something extremely cold touches the roof of your mouth, the nerve center located there tends to overreact.
- In both cases, the sun‚Äôs UV rays break down melanin, which is the pigment responsible for the color of your hair and skin. The difference is in the fact that hair is made up of dead cells while skin cells are alive. 
- Kids are only starting to get acquainted with the world around them, and their memory has to collect more data. So their year contains more new and unfamiliar ""events"" than that of a grown-up.
- The pigeons hanging out in urban areas have developed a habit of settling on the rocky landscape where there are no trees. It means they didn‚Äôt inherit the tree-perching reflex of their rural or jungle relatives. 
- Dust is actually gray, but the tiny size of its particles prevents us from seeing its true color. 
- Dust is actually gray, but the tiny size of its particles prevents us from seeing its true color. 
- When you sleep, it optimizes the synapses in your brain. What this means is that your memories solidify and the tidbits of information you‚Äôve gotten throughout the day move from your short-term to your long-term memory.

üëï T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

NAKHON SI THAMMARAT - Welcome to Nakhon Si Thammarat, located in Southern Thailand, and one of my favorite provinces in Thailand. It‚Äôs home to some of the spiciest, and most flavorful food in all of Thailand, and they have an abundance of delicious seafood. Today we‚Äôre taking a day trip to Laem Talumphuk, which is a cape jetting into the ocean just a 45 minute drive from Nakhon Si Thammarat. Get ready to eat some serious Thai seafood!

Cha-Run Seafood (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏à‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ì) - Along the cape, you‚Äôll find a number of seafood restaurants, right along the sand. We chose to eat at Cha-Run Seafood (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏à‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ì), and I can tell you right away, highly recommended. It was an outstanding meal.

First of all, the owner and all the chefs were incredibly nice and so friendly, and they laughed so hard the entire time we were there about the fan exploding.

We ordered a huge amount of seafood, and southern Thai foods, including clams, a giant alien mantis shrimp the size of my forearm, mullet in sour soup, seawater catfish curry, and not forgetting the golden yellow crab roe. In addition to the seafood, there‚Äôs nothing better than sitting with your feet in the sand while you eat.

Total price - 1,520 THB ($49.17)

After lunch, we continued driving down to the end of Laem Talumphuk, mostly just to see the view. It‚Äôs quite a unique landscape and nice place to visit, but the seafood is the real reason to visit.

12 Ways to Escape the Heat If You Don‚Äôt Have an Air Conditioner,"How to Survive the Summer Heat without an AC. How can you survive when the temperature outside gets up to 100¬∞F and you have no air conditioner at home? We have searched for simple and super effective ways to escape the sweltering heat that won‚Äôt cost you anything but will work their magic. 
The lowest temperature of the day is usually between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m., so open your windows in the morning and after 8 p.m. To prevent the sun‚Äôs heat from entering your house, it‚Äôs important to use the right curtains. In the past, before air conditioners existed, people used to wet their floors. The room temperature would drop immediately, and it would be comfortable enough to fall asleep. A great way to cool down your bed is to put your sheets and pillowcases in the fridge. Before you go to sleep, make your bed with them.

SUMMARY
-Shut the windows when the temperature outside is higher than 75¬∞F, and open them when the temperature drops below that.
-Go for linen fabrics with light neutral colors. This type of cloth is made from eco-friendly materials. Moreover, it‚Äôs hypoallergenic and mold resistant.
-If you don‚Äôt want that heat to stay inside your home, it‚Äôs better to get rid of things that collect dust: carpets, rugs, and sofa pillows. This will make the air cleaner and cooler.
-When airing your room, wet a towel, and hang it in front of an open window. It will help to cool down your home quickly.
-Ceiling fans are cheap, maximizing space and cooling down a room pretty well. If you have this type of fan, make sure that the switch is set to summer mode.
-Freeze a few bottles or other containers with water, and place them in front of a fan. Cool air will be blown all over the room.
-If your bed linen is made of satin or synthetics, it‚Äôs better to replace it with cotton or silk sheets. Cotton sheets absorb sweat well and cool down the skin. Another way to cool down your bed is to put your sheets and pillowcases in the fridge.
-Wear pajamas made of cotton as they breathe better. Or sleep without clothes on.
-Opt for compact fluorescents and LEDs over incandescent light bulbs. It‚Äôs better to stick with LED lighting because it has a longer lifespan. 
-Grab an ice pack or cold compress. If you don‚Äôt have these, wet a bandana, or wrap an ice cube in a cloth. Place it over the pulse points of your elbows, wrists, groin, neck, and ankles. 
-According to the American Heart Association, dehydration is a serious condition that can lead to problems ranging from swollen feet or headaches to life-threatening illnesses like heat stroke.
-Many air conditioners have a function for temperature retention or night mode. In this mode, an air conditioner turns on and off, maintaining a steady temperature in the room.

25 SIMPLE RESIN CRAFTS THAT WILL DEFINITELY LEAVE YOU INSPIRED,"SIMPLE RESIN CRAFTS 

It looks like if I‚Äôm going to want to tackle this resin trend, I‚Äôm going to need to invest in some new craft tools. It‚Äôs definitely a specialized craft that will require a few new things. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm considering.

Resin ‚Äì Shocker! You need some resin to make a resin craft. There are different types for different applications, so if you start a project, make sure you get the right stuff!

Heat Gun or Butane Torch  ‚Äì They help get rid of bubbles. I also saw one tutorial that used a lamp placed directly over the project so that it was getting some heat from the light bulb.

Dremel Multi Tool ‚Äì I saw the Dremel multi tool used for a couple of different purposes. It was used to sand and polish the resin to get that glossy shine. It was also used as a drill in some of the jewelry tutorials I found so that the chain could be added to the pendant.

Packing Tape ‚Äì I was surprised to see packing tape included in many of the smaller scale projects that I found. It helps to keep your piece from moving around and stops the resin from pouring out of the bottom/sides of your project.

Straws ‚Äì This is another odd ball thing to use, but many of the tutorials called for using a straw to blow out the bubbles that might be in the project.

European Parliament approves Brexit agreement - BBC News,"Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.

MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels.

After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne.

Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU.

The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday.

President Trump in London for NATO meeting - BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has arrived in London for a meeting between NATO leaders, promising not to get involved in the UK's general election campaign, before doing precisely that. He said he was a 'fan of Brexit' and thought Boris Johnson was 'very capable'. He then added he could work 'with anybody' in Number Ten. The election is just nine days away. Mr Trump also denied that the NHS would be on the table in any future trade talks with the UK.

Meanwhile divisions between NATO leaders have been exposed during the day. President Trump accused President Macron of France of being 'nasty' and 'disrespectful' for describing NATO as 'brain dead'. Mr Macron defended his comments and highlighted differences with Turkey, which are threatening to derail efforts to set up a new missile defence system.

Huw Edwards presents tonight's BBC News at Ten and unravels the day's events with the BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young and diplomatic correspondent James Robbins.

"Powerful Solar Storm Happened Once, See What It Caused","Have you ever heard of Carrington Event? It was the worst solar storm ever recorded. On September 2, 1859, people all over Europe and North America woke up at night, confused and still tired. But when they looked out of their windows, they discovered it wasn't sunlight. Auroras appeared even in the regions where they had never been witnessed before, like Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Hawaii. 

The most high-tech stuff of that time, telegraph wires, shorted out throughout Europe and the US. Sparks were flying from equipment, and many human operators got electric shocks. Papers in telegraph offices burst into flames. All the machines were immediately disconnected from their batteries. Fires, ignited by short-circuits, spread over large areas. Earth's inhabitants had never seen or experienced anything like that before.  At that time, very few people knew that the Sun was to blame for this chaos... So, let's figure out what a solar storm can do to Earth and how dangerous a geomagnetic storm.

"If You See a Spot on a Banana, Throw It Away Immediately!","Ah, bananas‚Ä¶They‚Äôre delicious, nutritious, and potentially malicious! Wait, what was that last part? How could one little banana do any harm whatsoever?! Well, what if I told you that these days some of them can easily send you to the hospital? Yeah, you‚Äôll definitely wanna know about this, so please watch our new video!

#spotbanana #fruitspider

Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

SUMMARY: 
- The first huge eye-opening case of this potassium-packed fruit‚Äôs potential danger happened back in 2013. A 29-year-old U.K. woman just bought a couple of bananas. She noticed white fuzzy spots on one of them but figured it was just mold on the peel.
- In May 2017, a 30-year-old English woman also became victim of this horrendous experience when she was about to peel her banana and noticed a white egg sac on it. This sac suddenly broke open, releasing hundreds of spiders that started crawling on her hands and arms.
- n July 2018, a Connecticut woman found the infamous and extremely deadly Black Widow in some pre-packaged grapes she‚Äôd bought at the store.
- And if just one of your apples has mold, it won't be long till this mold spreads to other perfectly fine ones. So, it goes without saying, don‚Äôt buy or eat moldy apples!
- If the pears you're about to buy are soft anywhere else, that's a bad sign of overripe fruit that shouldn't be consumed.
- Again, oranges are pretty safe from any unpleasant eight-legged surprises. But as far as consuming them goes, you wanna stay away from too soft and moldy oranges.
- The sweetest green grapes are yellow-green, and the best red ones are predominantly red. As for black grapes, it's better to choose richly black ones.
- Peaches are delicious and all, but it can be hard to pick the best ones. The first clue of a good peach is a vibrant color. The only red flag here is lighter parts with green tones, which mean that the peach was picked way too early and won't taste as good as a ripe one.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

LYRICS

Cuando no la llamo
Siempre me hace reclamos
Discutimos, peleamos
Pero llego a casa en la noche
La molesto y arreglamos

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Qu√© pena me dar√≠a
No tenerte en mi vida, vida m√≠a, mami
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Qu√© pena me dar√≠a
No tenerte en mi vida, vida m√≠a (ay vamos)

No importa si est√°s lejos
Siempre te siento presente
Y estoy pendiente de ti frecuentemente
Cuando estoy en la calle
Resolviendo mis problemas
Es pa' nuestro futuro
Yo no s√© por qu√© me celas
No soy un santo
Tampoco ando en cosas malas
Cuando no estoy contigo
Es porque ando con mis panas
Somos polos opuestos
Y por eso nos gustamos
Qu√© m√°s le vamos a hacer
Si as√≠ nos enamoramos
Y ah√≠ vamos

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Qu√© pena me dar√≠a
No tenerte en mi vida, vida m√≠a, mami

Todos los d√≠as yo la tengo que ver
As√≠ peleemos primero, mi mujer
Mami, no me celes tanto
Que yo siempre me conmuevo con tu llanto
Nena, nena, tranquil√≠cese
Que en la calle a nadie bes√©
Yo solo tengo ojos pa' usted
Rel√°jate, despreoc√∫pate
Nena, nena, tranquil√≠cese
Que en la calle a nadie bes√©

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé

Indian doctors on strike over rape and murder of colleague | BBC News,"Doctors in India have begun a national strike, escalating the protest against the rape and murder of a female colleague in the West Bengal city of Kolkata.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the country's largest grouping of doctors, said all non-essential hospital services would be shut down across the country on Saturday.

The IMA described last week's killing as a ""crime of barbaric scale due to the lack of safe spaces for women"" and asked for the country's support in its ""struggle for justice"".

Protests against the attack and calling for the better protection of women have intensified in recent days after a mob vandalised the hospital where it happened.

In a statement, the IMA said emergency and casualty services would continue to run and that the strike would last for 24 hours.

Chemical Exposures and the Brain: The Flint Water Crisis and More | The Forum at HSPH,"The water crisis gripping Flint, Michigan has exposed thousands of children to unsafe lead levels, triggering a federal emergency declaration and national conversation about basic public health protections. Lead can be toxic to the brain, and children can be particularly vulnerable. However, the Flint example is not unique; other American cities, including the nation‚Äôs capitol, have faced lead contamination in water supplies. And research has pointed more generally to an expanding list of chemicals, including certain pesticides, mercury and flame retardants, that may be linked to cognitive delays and health conditions in children. This Forum examined those links and the implications for both children and adults, while exploring public policy successes and failures in safeguarding the public‚Äôs health against neurotoxicants.

Part of The Andelot Series on Current Science Controversies, this Forum event was presented February 19, 2016 in Collaboration with PRI‚Äôs The World & WGBH.

SEMA Drag Race: Hellcat vs Blasphemi vs Jeep FC vs Sonic! - 2014 SEMA Week Ep. 5,"We've reached the final day of 2014 SEMA Week brought to you by 76, and only we would dare to bring this ridiculous mix of vehicles together for a grudge race on an unprepped airport runway. Fred Williams, Jessi Lang, Mike Sabounchi and Mike Finnegan begged and bribed SEMA Show exhibitors to loan them vehicles for a ¬º mile drag race and, though Finnegan and Sabounchi failed, the group still managed to acquire a Jeep riding on tank treads, a fresh-off-the-floor 2015 Dodge Challenger Hellcat, the infamous Hemi-powered ‚Äô55 Chevy Bel Air from Roadkill, and a turbocharged 2013 Chevy Sonic to do battle.
 
The racers are as different as the cars. Finnegan lives in the world of hot rods, Lang regularly pilots the best the OEM carmakers have to offer, Williams spends all of his time in the dirt, and Sabounchi hops up every compact car on the planet. Who will come out on top? Watch and find out!

Clashes erupted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - BBC News,"Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the ""brink of total collapse"" after more than five months of protests, police have warned.

The warning came a day after the territory saw a marked escalation in violence, with police shooting one activist in the torso.

A pro-Beijing supporter was later set on fire by anti-government protesters.

Protesters continued to clash with police on Tuesday in the central business district and at universities.

According to news agency AFP, hundreds of masked protesters were seen throwing bricks and other objects, while police used tear gas to force them back.

But there were also thousands of office workers out on the streets, peacefully chanting: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!""

Isaac Dunbar - boy (Live) | Vevo DSCVR at Home,"Isaac Dunbar - boy. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

For the Cape Cod-bred seventeen-year-old who writes and produces songs from his bedroom, music is essential to Isaac Dunbar. The son of a West African dad and European mom, he masterfully wields music as a tool of expression, a means with which to outwardly grapple with his sexuality, his relationships and his deepest (and sometimes darkest) thoughts. Counting Lady Gaga as an early inspiration, Dunbar dresses like he just walked off the set of one of her music videos; His synth-laden, sometimes boisterous production-style pulls influence from albums like ‚ÄòThe Fame Monster‚Äô and 'Artpop.' His age belies him, especially on his first full-length project, ‚Äúballoons don‚Äôt float here.‚Äù It's an 8-track array of songs that share wisdom beyond his years. Dunbar‚Äôs advanced emotional maturity is something that he's keenly aware of himself. ‚Äúif only we were right/seasoned with time,‚Äù he sings on ‚Äúboy,‚Äù from this year‚Äôs ‚Äòisaac‚Äôs insects‚Äô EP, while obsessing over a hypothetical life with a crush. Curled up in the corner of his room, his Vevo at Home performance of ‚Äúboy‚Äù gives the song an intimate context, a genuine glimpse into his special world.

"Thai Chili Frog (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏ö) That Made Me Cry Tears of Joy, Chiang Mai","Some of the best restaurants in Thailand I‚Äôve eaten at have been a product of just walking around with no plans and discovering a restaurant. That‚Äôs exactly what happened when we ate at Loong Thai Khao Gaeng (‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ), a restaurant in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

We had justed visited a local market, located across the street from Chiang Mai university, and we were headed back to the center of town to have lunch and to walk around more. But just as we were about to jump into the back of a taxi (rot songthaew), we noticed a restaurant that was bumping with customers‚Ä¶ and it wasn‚Äôt even lunchtime yet. One thing I‚Äôm always paying attention to when I eat is crowds of people at a restaurant - if you ever notice a crowd, that‚Äôs a pretty good sign of something good being served.

Loong Thai Khao Gaeng (‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ) is a Thai rice and curry restaurant. You can choose to order your food with a separate plate of rice bowls of dishes, or you can get a plate of rice and then choose the different dishes you want placed on top. We ordered a combination of both. First I got a plate of rice topped with some amazing looking pad phet neua (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠ beef fried in red curry) and mara pad kai (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πà bitter melon fried with egg). On the side, I couldn‚Äôt resist ordering an extra dish of lon dao jeow (‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß) an old school Thai dish, like a dip used for vegetables, made from fermented soy beans. Finally, I wasn‚Äôt first going to order it, but after seeing nearly everyone who was eating there order it, I got an extra plate of gob pad phet (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏ö frog fried in red chili curry). 

The two chili curry dishes looked incredibly spice from the start, bright red in color, and were just stuffed with chilies. The pad phet neua (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠ beef fried in red curry), was incredibly good, and it tasted sort of like beef jerky, flavored with wonderful spices and an unbelievable amount of chili coated onto every single piece. I‚Äôm a huge fan of bitter melon, and the bitter melon stir fried with egg was a perfect complement to the spicy beef. The lon dao jeow (‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß) is a unique and interesting dish. It has a bit of a flavor of cheese, but for myself it was a bit on the sweet side. It did taste good with raw vegetables, but I would have preferred it, had it not been so sweet. Finally the pad phet gob (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πá‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏ö frog fried in red chili curry) was wonderful. Again, the spices and chili were incredibly pungent, and I actually cried from eating it. The chunks of frog were nice and tender and despite all the little boney pieces of frog, there was still some good meat to it.

If you love spicy food, and want to try some authentic Northern style rice and curry when you‚Äôre in Chiang Mai, Loong Thai Khao Gaeng (‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ) is a wonderful place. But do be prepared to cry from the amount of chilies they use in their cooking. They also have some dishes that aren‚Äôt too spicy, but you should most definitely try the spicy dishes, as that‚Äôs what they are most famous for.

Lyrics:
If your thoughts are like a storm and you can‚Äôt stop the rain
If you‚Äôre carrying your past like it‚Äôs a ball and chain
If you feel like it won‚Äôt get better
There‚Äôs hope, don‚Äôt you dare say never
Step out of the dark into a brand new day

And say goodbye
Goodbye to the enemy‚Äôs lies
Goodbye to the fear inside
Say goodbye
Goodbye to the shame you hide
Goodbye to regret filled life
Say hello to born again
Say hello to love that never ends
You can leave the past behind
Look it straight in the eye
And say goodbye
Say goodbye say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye say goodbye

There‚Äôs mercy like an ocean you can sail away
Untie the rope that‚Äôs holding you to your mistakes
This freedom is sunny weather
You don‚Äôt have to wear a sweater
Nothing like the feeling when you finally say

Say goodbye
Goodbye to the enemy‚Äôs lies
Goodbye to the fear inside
Say goodbye
Goodbye to the shame you hide
Goodbye to regret filled life
Say hello to born again
Say hello to love that never ends
You can leave the past behind
Look it straight in the eye
And say goodbye
Say goodbye say goodbye
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye say goodbye

All that pain
It‚Äôs not who you are
It‚Äôs not who you are
All that shame
It‚Äôs not who you are
It‚Äôs not who you are
Always loved 
That‚Äôs who you are
That‚Äôs who you are
A child of God
That‚Äôs who you are 
That‚Äôs who you are

Say goodbye
Goodbye to the enemy‚Äôs lies
Goodbye to the fear inside
Say goodbye
Goodbye to the shame you hide
Goodbye to regret filled life
Say hello to born again
Say hello to love that never ends
You can leave the past behind
Look it straight in the eye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye say goodbye
(Say hello to grace)
Say goodbye say goodbye
(Say hello to freedom)
Say goodbye say goodbye
Just shout it out as loud as you can scream it
Believe it
To the old me I
Say goodbye

Lily Moore - Nothing On You (Live | Vevo DSCVR),"Lily Moore - Nothing On You. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

When Lily Moore was performing at open mic nights in Brighton clubs, audiences knew they had something more than a wannabe on their hands. The young UK singer, who gladly accepts the compliment that she has a sizable dab of Amy Winehouse soul floating through her seductive pop tunes, boasts a fetching authority for her age. She's a convincer. Check the tracks on her 'Not That Special' EP, a collection that earned her lots of cred, and you'll hear a gentle power at work. An Aretha Franklin zealot who tells interviewers her listening pleasures are a ""cocktail of old and new"" music, Moore balances a heartfelt approach with a cocky delivery. She's opened for Vance Joy, George Ezra and James Bay, and her name is getting around. Our new DSCVR artist brings two sweet performances to the series. Don't miss ""Nothing On You"" and ""Everybody's Falling in Love.""

Fake news and real fears in the war over vaccines - BBC News,"Scientists say, repeatedly, that vaccines have never been safer - or more effective. So why do some people still refuse to trust them?

Outbreaks of diseases are happening in countries where they haven't been seen for decades. And number of people choosing not to vaccinate their children seems to be on the rise. It's one of the top 10 global health risks this year, according to the WHO.

BBC Population Reporter Stephanie Hegarty went to Italy, where vaccines have become a big issue in recent years, to explore a debate that's riddled with misinformation and fake news.

2022 Overland Adventure | Immersed in Desert Training Center History | Presented by Jeep,"Day 3 of The 2022 Four Wheeler Overland Adventure Presented by Jeep welcomed participants with the smells of rain-soaked Creosote shrubs and blooming Ocotillo plants.

The day's journey carried participants to another of General Patton's training camps, Camp Coxcomb. This camp was once occupied by the 7th Armored Division, the 85th Infantry Division, the 93rd Infantry Division, and the 95th Infantry Division. Camp Coxcomb can be found across the valley from the Palen Pass Maneuver Area.
Wheels turned once again and we proceeded to Camp Iron Mountain, found in the shadow of the Iron Mountains. As the group unfolded awnings and enjoyed a bite to eat away from the radiating desert heat, some ogled the remains of two chapel altars, one Catholic and another for Protestant services.

The day's travels concluded near Vidal Junction, where some chose to make camp for the evening. To escape the heat, some folded out shelters from their vehicles to recline in the shade, and others pointed their rigs toward the nearby Colorado River for a refreshing swim.

Why Could Cockroaches Live Forever?,"How to get rid of cockroaches? Why is it so hard to do this? You come face to face with these little monsters on a daily basis ‚Äî flying from wall to wall, lounging on your sink, crawling on your countertop, or chilling on your headboard while you‚Äôre asleep. They taunt you over and over again. Today we‚Äôll find out the reason behind the indestructibility of cockroaches and other insects.

TIMESTAMPS: 
How cockroaches survived for more than 320 million years 1:47
What in their genes is? 2:53
What if you cut their heads off 4:05
Some other insects that are difficult to get rid of 5:17

SUMMARY:
- The World Health Organization says that the most notorious are the American, German, Oriental, Australian, and brown-banded cockroaches.
- Their original breeding ground can be found in Africa, and they hitchhiked on boats around the year 1625 to spread terror in the US and all over the world. What ambitious pesky insects! 
- There are 154 olfactory receptors, which is twice as many as any other insect. Hmm‚Ä¶it‚Äôs no wonder it can easily zero in on the tiniest crumb on the floor! This creepy-crawly also has 522 gustatory (or taste) receptors, and this means one thing: it isn‚Äôt a picky eater.
- The roach‚Äôs brain doesn‚Äôt control its breathing; instead, it sucks in air through its tracheae, which is connected to its spiracles. This insect can live for weeks because it‚Äôs cold-blooded, and the antennae of its decapitated head can still wave and say ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù to you for several hours.
- The mountain stone weta is from New Zealand, more specifically, the Southern Alps. This grasshopper-like insect was already roaming Earth during the prehistoric era ‚Äî just like cockroaches.
- The bed bug gene (yes, genes again!) contains enzymes and proteins that can fight off chemicals from pesticides. It doesn‚Äôt only contain purely bed bug genes but also genes from other organisms like the parasitic bacterium Wolbachia.
- The housefly occupies almost 90% of human habitations. Its origin lies in Central Asia, and it carries over 100 serious pathogens like cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis. They are one of the sleekest insects, and no amount of swatting can kill them off easily.
- Fire ants have a special killing condition to successfully prevent this from happening. Fire ants are social creatures, most especially their queens. Fire ant queens can unite with other queens to create a new colony together.

Reunited: Daughter finds homeless dad online after 20 years - BBC News,"Ray Bryant was sleeping rough on the streets of Barking when two of his friends launched a campaign to raise money to help him secure a home before Christmas. By chance, that campaign was seen by 22-year-old Annie in Devon - who realised the man in the photos was her long-lost father. Ray has had a difficult past, spending time in prison as well as battling a drug addiction. He lost contact with his daughter 19 years ago and had not seen her since she was a toddler - until yesterday. Our reporter Jim Reid went to meet them at their reunion.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

'This is War': Poland‚Äôs battle for abortion - BBC News,"Huge protests have erupted in Poland as the government attempts to ban nearly all abortions.

We spent a night on the streets with the protesters as some were beaten and pepper-sprayed by police.

The Catholic country already has strict rules on abortion but the new law would stop women whose babies were likely to die after birth from having terminations.

Shocked by the scale of the protests, the government has delayed the ban, but some hospitals have already started turning women away.

Three generations of family killed in Russian missile strike ‚Äì BBC News,"A Ukrainian man whose wife and three-month-old daughter were killed in a Russian missile strike has said he wants the world to know how they died.

Yuriy Glodan had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion.

When he reached his flat, he found the bodies of his wife and her mother, killed by a Russian missile that had ripped into the lower floors of the block.

At least six other people were killed when their residential tower block, in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, was hit.

Myths You‚Äôve Lived Your Whole Life Believing ‚Äì Finally Debunked,"Think you know the truth about some of life's big questions? Turns out, a lot of what we believe is just plain wrong!

Shaving doesn‚Äôt make your hair grow back thicker‚Äîthat‚Äôs just how stubble feels. And no, lightning can strike the same place twice (just ask the Empire State Building). So, it‚Äôs time to toss out these myths and start looking at the world with fresh eyes!

Not All Icebergs Are White: What Makes Them Rainbow?,"The ocean covers 70 percent of the planet's surface, and we've only explored around 20% of it so far. Back in March 2019, scientists stumbled upon one of the most baffling phenomena ever: a small lake that was upside-down! If you ever check out the ocean surface during sunset and sunrise, you might get lucky enough to see green flashes. In the depths of the Pacific Ocean, there's a mysterious singing whale, which scientists have yet to fully understand. Let's travel into the depths together to try to uncover some of the world ocean's secrets.

FIRST AID HACKS TO SAVE YOUR DAY,"Valuable hacks for emergencies

Hello, crafters! In this video, you will see many first aid hacks that will make your life easier. We will also show you a bunch of cool gadgets that will help you in emergencies. For example, when you or your child have a splinter stuck in your finger, you can use a regular syringe to remove it in seconds. If you have a tube of PVA glue, you can also use it! Just add some of it on top of the splinter and skin around it, let the glue dry, and then carefully remove it with the splinter inside. 
If you're a parent, you're probably experiencing problems with your child visiting the doctor. If going to the doctor stresses your kid out, grab an antistress toy with you to distract them a little bit. We will show you how to make such a toy yourself (just grab a plastic bottle, some hydrogel balls, and a balloon). 
Stay tuned, and you will find more life-saving hacks for different emergencies.

Lyrics:
Oh, oh
I've been down so long
Oh, I've been down so much, I've been down so much
Trying to get back up, I can't get back up

I've been out for months, trying to get back up
Got my friends with me, they was in the cut
They're gonna show me love, been with me through worse
Everybody knows life can hit reverse
Need to go to church, gotta get it right
Need to talk to God, God can get it right
I remember back when I gave my life
I didn't know back then I'd be criticized
Put my name on wax, Instagram comments
Talking about how I have up nothing
Sacrificed my whole life for this
And I ain't give them more than Birthday Christmas
Oh, you mut be proud, you just put me down
If you're talking loud, stop running your mouth
I've paid all my dues, can't walk in these shoes
Working all night and the morning too
Sacrifice the lamb and the real ones do
I've been born again, y'all thought I was through

Coming back like Jesus on the third day
Bringing you the gospel on replay
Bringing you the gospel on replay
Don't want me to win? Then ok

You can keep your number ones and awards
I need fire
And if the enemy wanna see or be
I don't wanna play the radio or TV
I'm talking to you, if you say it again
I promise I'll sue

I don't need a invite to your birthday party
I don't need to come around anybody
Get' em, God, get't em, God, get' em down, headlock
Left, right, choke slam

Jesus is alive, I have been revived
I am coming back and I got all the vibes
Follow me to life, given glory to God
Looking at my opps and they want me to die

Fire, I need fire
I know I'll make it throgh the night If I have your fire
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
Fire, revived, revive, revive
Fire, help me, God, I've been down so much
Trying to get back up

Jesus, show me love, pick me from the dust
Oh, pick me from the dust, I've been down so much
Trying to get back up
Jesus, show me love, pick me from the dust
I am not the one, I am not the dude
Warned you
Warned you",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiB5XWn6fKw

The impact of two years of war in Ukraine,"The war in Ukraine is still having a devastating impact on people‚Äôs health. Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) is working in the east and south of the country, close to the front lines and areas that are constantly under bombardment. 

""The population has suffered a lot of violence, a lot of loss, a lot of isolation, a lot of fear,‚Äù said Diego R√°fales, an MSF project coordinator in Ukraine, ""which in the end could plunge the country into a kind of trauma, collective trauma that, if not responded to in an adequate way, can lead to the development of serious mental disorders.‚Äù

Most of the health care response in Ukraine is provided by the Ukrainian health care system and local volunteer groups, who have responded to a substantial increase in needs, often working in harsh conditions near the frontlines. MSF teams continue to support the health care system by filling in the gaps aggravated and caused by the war.

You calm my restless mind
Your love is my lifeline
¬†
You are everything to me
You‚Äôre my anchor out at sea
You are the blood in my veins
My peace of mind in the pain
When I am barely treading
You are everything to me

You never let me go
Never let me go
When hope starts fading
You never let me go
Never let me go
When I need saving

Thai Beef Noodles (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πã‡∏ô Kuay Teow Neua),"Visit http://migrationology.com/ for more travel and street food.

Beef is not always available in Bangkok, so when I hear about a restaurant serving top notch Thai noodles with beef, I get pretty excited. 

In this video, I visited a little set of stalls on Udom Suk road in Bangkok, Thailand to slurp down a deliciously beefy bowl of goodness.

The noodles along with a few sprigs of morning glory and bean sprouts were blanched in boiling water before the thumb sized chunks of fall apart tender beef were added to the soup. The soup was an oily but massively flavorful combination of beef flavoring.

Beef noodles are a wonderful addition to world of Thai noodles!

If you'd like to go to this exactly spot, here's the information you'll need. It's closest to Udom Suk BTS station, but the restaurant is still about a 20 minute walk from there. You may want to take a motorbike taxi or jump in the back of a communal vehicle (rot songthaew).

What's Wrong With That Popcorn Button,"Using the popcorn button on your microwave might not be the best idea. It doesn't actually know how much popcorn you're making, so it often overcooks or undercooks the popcorn. This can leave you with burnt popcorn or a lot of unpopped kernels. It's better to follow the instructions on the bag and listen for the popping to slow down. That way, you'll get a perfect batch every time! Let's look at this and other electric gadgets with hidden trouble.

"Ultimate Adventure 2023 Ep 1: Biggest, Baddest UA is Underway | MotorTrend","Welcome to Ultimate Adventure 2023, presented by RealTruck, the best-known and most revered off-road adventure trip in the world. This year UA2023 kicks off the biggest, baddest trip in its 24-year history at Rock Run Recreation Area in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. And it only gets more intense from here!

Since 1999, Ultimate Adventure has been the world's best and longest-running off-road adventure trip of its kind. Participants meet in a different location each year with highly modified 4x4 vehicles equipped to tackle the toughest trails in the nation over a grueling 1,000-plus mile trek held over seven days. But as a double-whammy there are no trailers allowed, so in addition to insane off-road prowess, these crazy trucks, Jeeps, and 4x4s must be able to eat up the road miles as well as the obstacles. All this and the necessity to carry everything needed to live in the bush for a week on end. Nobody but Christian Hazel and Trent McGee know where they're going or what bucket-list locations they'll visit. It's the ultimate test of man and machine, team-building camaraderie, and human as well as mechanical endurance. It's the Ultimate Adventure!

Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head? Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs original new film ‚ÄúInside Out‚Äù ventures inside the mind to find out. 
 
Based in Headquarters, the control center inside 11-year-old Riley‚Äôs mind, five Emotions are hard at work, led by lighthearted optimist Joy (voice of Amy Poehler), whose mission is to make sure Riley stays happy. Fear (voice of Bill Hader) heads up safety, Anger (voice of Lewis Black) ensures all is fair and Disgust (voice of Mindy Kaling) prevents Riley from getting poisoned‚Äîboth physically and socially. Sadness (voice of Phyllis Smith) isn‚Äôt exactly sure what her role is, and frankly, neither is anyone else.  
 
When Riley's family relocates to a scary new city, the Emotions are on the job, eager to help guide her through the difficult transition. But when Joy and Sadness are inadvertently swept into the far reaches of Riley‚Äôs mind‚Äîtaking some of her core memories with them‚ÄîFear, Anger and Disgust are left reluctantly in charge. Joy and Sadness must venture through unfamiliar places‚ÄîLong Term Memory, Imagination Land, Abstract Thought and Dream Productions‚Äîin a desperate effort to get back to Headquarters, and Riley.
 
Directed by Academy Award¬Æ winner Pete Docter (""Monsters, Inc."", ""Up""), produced by Jonas Rivera, p.g.a. (""Up""), co-directed by Ronnie Del Carmen (‚ÄúUp‚Äù) and featuring an original score by Michael Giacchino (""The Incredibles,"" ""Ratatouille,"" ""Up""), Disney‚Ä¢Pixar's ""Inside Out"" opens in U.S. theaters on June 19, 2015.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkmerqUzExE

Princes William and Harry set to unveil statue of mother Diana - BBC News,"Prince William and Prince Harry will unveil a statue in memory of their mother Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.

The Sun‚Äôs royal photographer, Arthur Edwards, who has been taking pictures of the royal family since 1977 for the newspaper said he hoped the event at Kensington Palace in London would be a healing moment.

""If this unveiling doesn't break the ice between them, nothing will,"" he said.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF; pronounced [meds…õÃÉ s…ëÃÉ f Å…îÃÉtj…õ Å] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel‚Äîmostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators‚Äîprovided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro! #Brazil #RioDeJaneiro #BrazilianFood #streetfood

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we‚Äôll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful cities I‚Äôve ever visited.

Here‚Äôs the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He‚Äôs not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you‚Äôre in Rio de Janeiro, you don‚Äôt want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn‚Äôt going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (P√£o de A√ß√∫car).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you‚Äôll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that‚Äôs famous for serving empada de camar√£o (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFA

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

Halala: The Men Who Sell Divorce - BBC News,"An exclusive investigation by the Asian Network and Victoria Derbyshire Program has found online services charging divorced Muslim women thousands of pounds to take part in sham Islamic marriages. The controversial practice, known as halala, is believed by a small minority of Muslims to be the only way a divorced woman can get back with her husband after a triple talaq - an instant divorce where a man says 'talaq' three times to his wife. These marriages can leave women open to financial exploitation, blackmail and even sexual abuse.

In this documentary, Athar Ahmad speaks to the women willing to have sex with a stranger in order to get back with their husband, asks why some are going to such extreme lengths and tracks down the men charging thousands of pounds to carry out sham Islamic marriages.

Syria frontline: inside Assad‚Äôs notorious jail of torture and execution | BBC News,"Huge crowds of Syrians gathered at the notorious Saydnaya prison searching for their relatives, following the collapse of the Assad regime. 

Saydnaya, known by Syrians as the ‚Äúhuman slaughterhouse‚Äù is where the Assad family held opponents of their regime for decades.

Thousands of people are believed to have been detained, tortured and executed at the prison since the Syrian civil war began in 2011.

BBC News at Ten presents frontline reporting by Barbara Plett Usher in Damascus.

Family concerned for jailed British-Egyptian activist on hunger strike - BBC News,"The family of a prominent British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist, who has been on hunger strike in jail for more than 100 days, are growing increasingly concerned for him.

Alaa Abdel Fattah is one of the most high profile government critics imprisoned in Egypt on what human rights groups say are politically-motivated charges.

He gained British citizenship in April and politicians and celebrities in the UK have come out in support of his release.

Since this video was filmed, it has been reported that his name has been passed to the Egyptian authorities to be considered for a Presidential pardon. However none has been issued so far.

Olivia Dean - The Hardest Part (Live) | Vevo DSCVR At Home,"Olivia Dean - The Hardest Part. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Olivia Dean epitomizes cool English sensibilities. The East London native is a self-described ‚Äúgranny‚Äù who's obsessed with drinking tea and spends idle hours penning poetry and lyrics in her room. Occasionally, she‚Äôll take the short trip to see relatives in France, a place where inspiration is also found easily. Mom had young Olivia listening to Aretha and other women vocalists who boasted a ‚Äúfierce, killin‚Äô it vibe.‚Äù That‚Äôs the wheelhouse in which the honey-voiced singer has organically developed her own personality. She also notes that Solange, Amy Winehouse and 'Graceland'-era Paul Simon have deeply influenced her palette. Trained at The BRIT School, a powerhouse arts academy with a deep reputation for nurturing talent, the 21-yr-old's vids for ‚ÄúBaby Come Home‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrosswords‚Äù got major love from viewers who related to the stuck-at-home themes. She kept that feeling alive in her DSCVR At Home performances of ‚ÄúThe Hardest Part‚Äù and ‚ÄúReason To Stay.‚Äù Make a cup, and enjoy.

24 CLEVER HACKS THAT MAKE PREGNANCY EASIER,"PREGNANCY TRICKS TO MAKE YOUR JOURNEY EASIER 

There are a ton of new challenges that come when you get pregnant. At first, everything seems to be going fine, but then, as your belly grows, you can‚Äôt shave your legs anymore, sleep on your stomach or not feel sleepy every two minutes. In this video, I show you some tips and tricks to make this magical experience better without all the mini problems that come with it. 
You can place a sponge in a selfie stick and then cover it up with some shaving foam. Then, you can apply the shaving foam on your legs using the extendable sponge, and you can attach your razor on the selfie stick to reach your ankles. 
To get rid of stretch marks and other pregnancy scars, you can mix some aloe vera gel with some coconut oil to make your own ointments for your belly. Apply it on the scars every night and you‚Äôll see great results in just a few months. 
I also show you the funny side of pregnancy. Where you have weird cravings and you can mix the most random ingredients for a snack. Or, when you‚Äôre so tired that you fall asleep while standing at the back of the line. 
When the baby is about to arrive, you also notice all the dangers around the house. So to keep your baby protected, you baby proof everything ‚Äì to the point that your apartment is empty.

The Man Who Ate a Plane and Somehow Survived,"üí° Our unique shop on Amazon (US only): http://amzn.to/3tkGbpY

With all of the DC and Marvel movies coming out, we are quick to admire the superheroes' strength, agility, and other cool stuff that makes them superhuman. But what about the people who don't appear in movies but still possess awesome superpowers? Michel Lotito became famous for being able to munch on inedible stuff. This French entertainer can eat anything, including rubber, metal, and glass. 

Doctors found out that the man had a very thick lining covering his stomach and intestines. Plus, his digestive juices were incredibly powerful. This gave him the ability to consume literally anything, including sharp or even toxic metals. No wonder Lotito got the nickname ""Monsieur Mangetout."" But he's most known for the time he ate an airplane. Okay, well, the man didn't actually eat any gigantic passenger plane. But he still consumed a mind-boggling 9 tons of metal!

Testing congruence by transformations example | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy,"Watch the next lesson: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/congruent-triangles/transformations-congruence/v/another-congruence-by-transformation-example?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=Geometry

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

It may just lead you back to someone in desperate need of help. There are some other simple life-saving tips that can help you a lot one day.

Anti-government protests turn deadly in Bangladesh | BBC News,"At least 14 people have been killed in Bangladesh as clashes erupted between police and anti-government protesters who are demanding that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina step down.

The latest round of tension comes as the student leaders have declared a campaign of civil disobedience against the government.

Police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in several parts of Bangladesh. Dozens have been injured across the country.

In the capital, Dhaka, access to internet on mobile devices has been suspended, with some providers telling local media they received orders from the government.

A curfew has been announced from 18:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday. According to local media reports, the curfew will be in place indefinitely.
