LYRICS: 
Somebody Prayed
Every night there by your bed
You fold your hands and bow your head
Throwing out another prayer in faith
When you wonder if He’s hearing you
Look at me I’m living proof
I’m only right where I am today
Because somebody prayed

So I hit my knees
Cause I’ve seen all heaven move
(Don’t matter if you hit rock bottom,
My God pick you up when you call Him)
I pray, Father please
Cause I’ve seen what He can do
(Don’t matter if the storm cloud coming,
My God come through when you call Him)
These hands have no power
But there ain’t an hour He don’t come through
That’s why when mountains move I say
Looks like somebody prayed

For the child of God that’s far from home
The one who thinks they’re too far gone
I’m throwing out another prayer in faith
Worn out altars, tear stained pews
Still I won’t give up on you
I believe that anything can change
When somebody prays

I’ve seen miracles come from feeble words
I’ve seen hospital rooms turned into cathedrals
And I’ve seen freedom come to the prisoner
You can’t tell me that prayer don’t work

Every night there by your bed
When you fold your hands and bow your head
Not a single word you’ve ever said in vain
Cause He hears everything

Neil takes it back to the Apollo program where we learn about the incremental progress of each mission and the risks they took.

How to Spot a Fake Designer Handbag In 7 Steps,"How to choose the real designer handbag and spot a fake handbag? How to differ fake from real easily? 
Buying a luxury car for men: you have to be very attentive to small details and know everything about your dream handbag. That’s why we decided to create a short yet very useful guide that will teach you how to choose the real thing. 

TIMESTAMPS
Pay attention to details 0:44
Check clasps, buttons, and zippers 1:15
Pay attention to the materials 1:49
Check tags and labels 2:15
Take a closer look at its serial number 2:41
An expensive handbag always has expensive packaging 3:03
Each brand has its very own distinct characteristics 3:25

SUMMARY
- All of the stitches should be perfectly even, and there should be no loose threads or any other visual defects or imperfections. All genuine designer handbags are handmade. 
- Pay special attention to small things like metal clasps, buttons, zipper pulls, plates, and locks. Their quality should be perfect, and they should have a number or a name printed on them, which is another sign of quality and authenticity.
- A famous brand doesn’t use rough leather. They only use fine, high-quality materials. When you touch them, you feel like you are in paradise. 
- Fake items often have the brand names printed in different fonts, smudgy letters, or even with misspellings. Tags and labels are always a giveaway. 
- The label with the number is sealed and attached in a special way, making it impossible to remove without damaging. Fake items usually have a sticker with a number that has just been glued somewhere on the surface.
- An expensive designer handbag always has expensive packaging, often made of the highest-quality materials. The package your precious bag comes in should have no color defects whatsoever. 
- Before visiting a store, do some research on the specific attributes of the chosen brand. Remember – each brand has its very own distinct characteristics.

Mexico quake: 'My heart tells me he will be alive' - BBC News,"On 19 September, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico, the most devastating in a generation.
One office block in central Mexico City - Alvaro Obregon 286 - is the deadliest site, with over 35 bodies recovered and more still missing. Families camped out for days as they waited for news of their loved ones, as dozens of rescuers searched the rubble.
The BBC spent three days with the family of 26-year-old Adrian Moreno, who had recently started working in the building.

Someone didn't get their Christmas toy (1983) - BBC News,"Every year there is a 'must have' toy on the shelves. Otherwise civilised people end up elbowing their way through the crowds in the attempt to grab that sought after Rubik cube or Buzz Lightyear. 
A look through the BBC Archive has thrown up some of the Christmas toy crazes of the past.

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

The singers finding ‘Instagram fame’ during Covid-19 lockdowns - BBC News,"When India imposed a coronavirus lockdown last year, it upended the country’s live music industry without any warning.

With gigs cancelled and concert dates pushed back, performers across the country were left without an audience. 

That pressure forced many of the artists online, and some carved a new stage for themselves on Instgram.

These singers and musicians - Mansa, Aishwarya Suresh Bindra, Mali and Tarun Balani - have found massive popularity as they find new ways to connect with fans.

But can social media completely fill the void of live performance spaces?

To eat or feed my child? #Yemen,"The malnutrition crisis in Yemen has many underlying causes. After over a decade of conflict and an unrelenting economic crisis, many people in Yemen have lost their livelihoods. High inflation rates have reduced people’s purchasing power so they can no longer afford enough nutritious food, and diminishing food aid distributions, including the suspension of the World Food Program's general food distributions in northern Yemen, have exacerbated an already dire situation. 

At the same time, pregnant people’s access to medical care, including prenatal and postnatal care, is seriously limited due to the lack of functional primary health care facilities and the high cost of transportation, resulting in early signs of malnutrition going undetected for many.

"Rohingya refugees: ‘Kill us, but don’t deport us to Myanmar’ - BBC News","It has been five years since hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled their native country of Myanmar, after a deadly crackdown by the government.

The majority left for neighbouring Bangladesh, ending up in what is believed to be the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar. Nearly half a million Rohingya refugees currently registered in Bangladesh are children.

Families rely entirely on charities for food and medicine – five years on many feel the world has forgotten them. Both India and Bangladesh want to send them back to Myanmar, but with the military in charge there, it is not an option.

Divorce - Introducing Divorce | Vevo DSCVR,"Introducing Divorce | Vevo DSCVR

For a band named after the dissolution of marriage, Divorce has some ironically good chemistry. Its members - Felix Mackenzie-Barrow, Tiger Cohen-Towell, Adam Smith & Kasper Sandstrøm - hail from Nottingham’s “close knit” music scene. As a result, the quartet have known and admired one another since their teenage days; High school relationships tend to end in break-ups, but this four’s creative bonds only strengthened over time. Having officially formed around 2021, Divorce deployed two EPs in back to back years: ‘Get Mean’ (2022) and ‘Heady Metal’ (2023). In hindsight, the first EP felt like a trust-building exercise, whereas the second pushed the emotional envelope a bit further. “Before, I felt like we were very much writing for Divorce, and trying to figure out what we wanted to say as a band,” said Tiger around the time of the release of ‘Heady Metal.’ If those first two projects were about finding and staking out intrapersonal balance, then the band’s debut album, ‘Drive To Goldenhammer,’ is a totem of collective transcendence, like slipping a forever ring on a soulmate’s finger. Tiger and Felix’s voices intertwine throughout, and one can hear the Queen influence come through on tracks such as “Lord” and “Hangman.” Like all relationships there’s moments of blissful, loving clarity - best exemplified on the astoundingly beautiful album opener “Antarctica” - followed by teetering collapses into distortion (“Karen” and “Jet Show”). In the DSCVR studio, they presented a united front. “We want our music to make people feel seen,” said Tiger.

Why You Shouldn't Drink Coffee from a Red Mug,"If you’re planning to hit some longevity records, coffee may come in handy.

Now here’s a question for you - what color is your coffee mug? Thing is, it matters a lot what you drink from, and one particular color is actually dangerous for you.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/

SUMMARY:
-Sailors say that lifeboat drills are more dangerous than any other kind of marine incident. 
-The larger the beverage, the more milk it has, not coffee. 
-Orchestra conductor recording soundtracks for a film are more reliant on the movies themselves than on music score sheets. They have it playing right in front of them on a small monitor, providing all the needed information about pauses, rhythm, and the intensity of the music.
-A damaged elevator will rise in some cases because of the counterweights, pulling an elevator cabin up in an emergency. 
-The main goal of improving information security for companies is just making every password difficult and unique in the first place, and having some kind of multi-step authorization process. 
-Your body produces countless new cells every day and some of those cells aren’t working properly. Your immune system is constantly searching for every error in cell development and eliminates the bad cells before they become a source of trouble.
-There’s no such thing as an unbreakable lock, but a good lock is intimidating enough to discourage most thieves. 
-When you are drowning, you’re fighting with the water for every breath; not everyone knows how to keep breathing enough to be able to yell. 
-It’s statistically impossible for a plane to be in perfect shape in every way. 
-Making your hair lighter is never an easy process, and often takes several visits to the hairdresser. It’ll most certainly lose its healthy look by the end of it. 
-Even when a tested person knows the person who’ll be telling lies or true facts to them, they still can’t tell if they’re fooling around. 
-The sound you’re hearing is just bubbles of carbon dioxide gas that are collecting in joints over time, and reduce its mobility.

ENNY - Under 25 (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022,"ENNY - Under 25. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

When artists balance confidence with doubt, they reveal the deep complexities of the human experience. Such is the case with the empowering music of Enitan Adepitan, aka ENNY. The South London singer radiates a personal authority, but she’s unafraid to ponder life’s more profound issues. Take “Peng Black Girls.” With a nonchalant keyboard motif driving it, the 2020 breakout hit repeats the lyric, “I think I need some time away.” Meaning, get out of my face, I’m doing me today. It’s a perfect track for your “chill” playlist, and a great spin on a sunny afternoon off. On the other hand, the song is an unabashed affirmation of Black female individualism. “Black women are beautiful. They don’t get told that enough,” the singer/rapper once said about the song’s creation. That refrain takes on a different meaning when its key racial undertones are considered. ENNY believes in herself, even when she expresses that the world’s innumerable inequities exhaust her. Last July, we initiated the singer into our DSCVR program. “She’s got bags of swag,” noted one commenter about her “I Want” performance. At the time, her ‘Under 25’ had just dropped. Months passed, and we kept coming back to it. So when we chose the participants for DSCVR Artists to Watch 2022, the choice was clear: getting ENNY back in the studio is a dream fulfilled.

Warnings of care staffing crisis due to new Brexit immigration rules - BBC News,"Experts in the care sector are warning that the UK's new immigration rules will add to an existing crisis over recruiting staff to care for the elderly and disabled. 

In England it’s estimated there are already 112,000 job vacancies in care homes and home care. 

From January 2021 the UK’s new immigration rules mean that most overseas care workers will not earn enough to qualify for a work visa. 

The government insists that care companies will be able to recruit enough people from within the UK.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Rocket Equation,"You’ve seen the rockets blast off into space, but, have you ever wondered the science behind the launch? On this StarTalk explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are exploring the rocket equation, space travel, and more.

To start, we discuss why the application of mathematics adds to the theory of a simulation universe. Then, Neil tells us about the problem with space travel: fuel. You have to have enough fuel to get where you want to go, but, the fuel you have to carry to get to your destination adds weight, which means you need more fuel. And so on, and so on. So, what do you do?

We explore how the miniaturization of electronics helped rockets shed weight. Discover more about SpaceX’s reusable rockets. All that, plus, Neil shares some of the experiments he used to do in his car to save gas.

"""What is an unsafe abortion?"" Answers to Your Questions about Abortion","Dr. Manisha Kumar, a family medicine doctor and the coordinator of the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Task Force for Safe Abortion Care, answered questions from our Instagram followers about MSF’s provision of safe abortion. ""In MSF, we've learned that in order to provide a safe abortion with pills, you need three things: accurate information, quality pills, and mutual respect and trust,” Dr. Kumar says.

Timestamps:

0:11 - What is a safe/unsafe abortion?

0:51 - Does MSF provide mental health resources for women seeking an abortion?

1:02 - How can we effectively advocate for safe and accessible reproductive care?

1:23 - I 100% support abortions, but how do we stop it from becoming a form of contraception?

1:46 - How do you deal with the religious who are against it?

1:59 - How has COVID-19 impacted abortions?

2:27 - Why should we (medics) support abortion? I am a med student from Chile.

Full transcript:

In MSF, we've learned that in order to provide a safe abortion with pills, you need three things: accurate information, quality pills, and mutual respect and trust. 

An unsafe abortion is one that's provided by someone who hasn't been adequately trained or in an environment that doesn't meet minimal medical standards. So, examples of this that we see in MSF are people taking traditional herbs or potions, even drinking battery acid or chlorine, putting things like sticks or broken glass or pen cartridges in their body to try to induce an abortion. And the other side, a safe abortion is one that's provided or supported by someone who's been adequately trained and by a medically approved method. [0:45] So, two examples of this are an abortion with pills or abortion procedures. 

People feel a whole bunch of different emotions about their abortion and that's okay and totally normal. The most commonly reported emotion looking back is actually relief. 

When it comes to family and friends, how are you showing up for the people in your life who may have had abortions or may need abortions in the future? How are you talking about this with them? And on the larger level, right? Depending on what's going on in your political landscape, how are you showing up for and supporting organizations who are trying to make reproductive healthcare more accessible? [1:21]
 
I think the question behind this question is actually, what if people have more than one abortion? And my answer is that's okay. It's okay if people have more than one abortion. If we 100% support abortion, that means that we 100% trust people to make the best decision for themselves with their body and with their lives. [1:44]
 
MSF is not a religious organization. We're not trying to change anybody's religious beliefs. MSF provides impartial non-biased healthcare to the most vulnerable and safe abortion care is healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic actually pushed some really long overdue innovations in the abortion field. So people started to really think outside the box and think about how can we provide this care without requiring people to come to a health care facility? So that's when people started doing more abortion consultations over the phone or via telehealth models and doing things like mailing abortion pills to patients and all those things can help us go a long way to increasing access to this essential health care. [2:26]
 
It's a public health issue. When people don't have access to safe abortion care, then they turn to unsafe methods. And at MSF we've seen the consequences of those unsafe methods firsthand. People can get really sick and they die. And this happens every day around the world. So in MSF, that's why we're so committed to reducing this death and suffering from unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion by providing access to contraception and safe abortion care. Thanks so much for your questions and for wanting to learn more about how safe abortion care is essential health care. [2:58]

"Ukraine war talks start now, President Trump says after call with President Putin | BBC News","US President Donald Trump has said he had a ""lengthy and highly productive"" phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

Later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had spoken with Trump about a ""lasting, reliable peace"".

The calls with the warring sides came as both Trump and his defence secretary said it was unlikely Ukraine would join Nato, which will come as a bitter disappointment to Kyiv.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin supported Trump's idea that the time had come to work together.

Today we’re going on a jungle street food tour of Tainod Green Market (หลาดใต้โหนด https://goo.gl/maps/sK7sPjzrJtGUeM4H7), which is this amazing local market where you’ll find everything from cooked southern Thai food to market fresh ingredients to southern Thai culture. You don’t want to miss the amazing food selection. Here’s what I ate:
 
Chicken - 15 Baht ($0.48) per piece - This was honestly some of the best grilled chicken I’ve had in a long time. It was so perfectly flavorful and rich, and smoky.

Rice and curry - 50 THB ($1.59) - Can’t ever beat a plate of rice and curry when you’re in Phatthalung (พัทลุง), just the best, it’s a meal I never get tired of.

Rice noodles - 15 THB ($0.48) - Next up for a plate of freshly made khanom jeen rice noodles. The southern Thai curries are pungent and spicy.

Arenga pinnata palm fruit (ลูกชก) - Another snack you’ll find is the jelly fruit from a palm tree called the Arenga pinnata. Unique and very good.

Fried cempedak - 20 THB ($0.64) - Next up for one of the greatest deep fried fruits in the world. It’s not a jackfruit, but a cempedak, which is common in southern Thailand and Malaysia. It’s so good, and almost has a natural honey juiciness to it. When you open a cempedak, if you do it correctly - I haven’t done it correctly many times, it opens so the skin peels and all the fruit remains on the core. Deep fried is heaven.

Snakefruit - 20 THB ($0.64) - Finally to complete this Thai jungle street food tour at Tainod Green Market (หลาดใต้โหนด) I had a bowl of peeled snake fruit. I loved the natural packaging. 

It’s an amazing market, one of my favorite markets in all of Thailand. The atmosphere, the greenness, and the delicious Thai food is what makes it spectacular.

Lyrics:

Lost sight for a second, but I’m back 
I remember, remember now 
Still hurts when people just walk out 
Oh, I hate when they walk out 

Don’t think I understood you were different, and I 
Don’t think I understood your decision to stay 
Lost sight for a second, but I’m back 
I remember now

Is anybody loyal to me? 
Is anybody loyal to me? 
Like you have been loyal 
Loyal, loyal, loyal

There is nobody safer to me 
You’ve always been a sanctuary 
‘Cause you have been loyal
Loyal, loyal, loyal

Can’t lie, didn’t think it’d go this way
Not surprised when promises break 
Truth is, you made everything okay 
No, you never give up on me 

Don’t think I understood you were different, and I 
Don’t think you really knew how much I wanted to stay 
Can’t lie, you made everything okay
Made it all okay

Is anybody loyal to me? 
Is anybody loyal to me? 
Like you have been loyal 
Loyal, loyal, loyal

There is nobody safer to me 
You’ve always been a sanctuary 
‘Cause you have been loyal
Loyal, loyal, loyal

Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
No one like you 

Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 

Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
Nobody’s been true 
Nobody’s been true like you 
You’ve always been loyal

Hearth of the Father

I've never known a love like Yours
So intimate, so powerful
And I've tasted, I've seen, and nothing comes close
I've never known a love like Yours
Jesus, Your name is power
It's breath, and living water
And Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Let Your praise ring louder
Everyday and every hour
'Cause Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
I've never felt at home like this
Just like a child, so innocent
And I'm safe inside Your arms
'Cause You won't let go
I've never known a love like Yours, Yours
Jesus, Your name is power
It's breath and living water
And your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Let Your praise ring louder
Every day and every hour
'Cause Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise
We sing praise
We sing praise
We sing praise
We sing praise
Jesus, Your name is power
It's breath and living water
And Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Let Your praise ring louder
Everyday and every hour
'Cause Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Jesus, Your name is power
It's breath and living water
And Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Let Your praise ring louder
Everyday and every hour
'Cause Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Sing praise
God, we sing praise

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Space,"What is space? In this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice explore the boundaries of space...the definition that is. 

We talk about space a lot, but what is it? You’ll learn about different levels of orbit, where we draw the line of where earth ends and space begins, and how far the International Space Station is from the surface of the earth. Is the ISS always in space? Should our definition of space be based on our planet’s atmosphere? Should we change our definition? How many astronauts have actually been to space? All that and more on another StarTalk explainer!

About the prints that flank Neil in this video:
""Black Swan” & ""White Swan"" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston. For more information about this artist and her work, visit Inuit Gallery of Vancouver: https://inuit.com/.

Bear said he spent ""an unguarded and honest time"" with Mr Obama, and said he came back ""pinching"" himself when filming was finished.

The comedian who could be president - BBC News,"Polls suggest Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian with no previous political experience, has become one of the frontrunners in Ukraine's presidential election.

His campaign is blurring the line between fact and fiction, as he stars in a hit TV series in which he plays a teacher who unexpectedly becomes president.

Some recent polls even put Mr Zelenskiy ahead of current President Petro Poroshenko, as well as opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, for the vote scheduled to begin with a first round on 31 March.

However, there are some important differences between Mr Zelenskiy and the TV character he plays, as BBC Ukraine Correspondent Jonah Fisher reports.

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel
Like I’m alone
A bit too broken
Unseen, unknown
Sometimes the doubt
Starts creeping in
So come remind me
Once again
 
I am believed in
I am held on to
Don’t have to wonder
Who I belong to
I’m always wanted, always known
And always treasured, it’s true
I am loved by You
 
It’s in your blood
It’s in your scars
How far You’d go
To reach my heart
You call me chosen
You call me Yours
That’s all that matters
Forevermore
 
I don’t deserve it, I never could
But You’re just that faithful, You’re just that good
How lovely it is
To be loved by You

Incredible Crispy Roast Goose and Claypot Rice in Hong Kong — HK Travel Food Guide!,"►Hong Kong Travel Guide for Food Lovers: https://goo.gl/AlcXel

►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

On Day 36 of our Round The World Trip for Food with Star Alliance, it was a rainy day in Hong Kong. We started off with some local dim sum, then had incredible roast goose and finished the night with claypot rice.

1:03 Breakfast dim sum at Sam Hui Yat - Thanks to http://www.foodiehub.tv/, for recommending this restaurant to me. Sam Hui Yat is a Hong Kong neighborhood dim sum restaurant that’s nothing fancy at all, but serves just good tasting, everyday dim sum and yum cha. It’s just a neighborhood hangout, and it’s the type of place I absolutely love. We had a mix of different dim sum, all of which sit at the front of the restaurant slowly steaming and keeping hot until they are ordered and eaten. Everything was good but the lo mai gai, glutinous rice steamed in a lotus leaf was one of my personal favorites. Total price - 102 HKD ($13.15)

7:32 Yung Kee Roast Goose - For lunch we headed to the legendary Yung Kee restaurant in Hong Kong, known for serving some of the best roast goose in all of Hong Kong. There are a lot of stories and drama that surrounds Yung Kee, that I don’t even begin to know all about. But anyway, the restaurant is overall very nice, like a pretty fancy Chinese Cantonese restaurant. The roast goose was absolutely out of this world, with skin that was so crispy and juicy, and a nice blend of salty and sweet in the sauce. Yung Kee is an amazing restaurant in Hong Kong for fantastic roast duck. The chicken and the other dishes we tried were also excellent. Total price - 654.50 HKD ($84.33)

17:29 Four Seasons Claypot Rice (Yau Ma Tei) - To be honest, my wife Ying and I were pretty tired and exhausted from the day, but we decided to head over to Yau Ma Tei for a quick local Hong Kong dinner and to walk around the Temple Street Night Market. Since we were both quite full from lunch, we only ordered a couple dishes including a claypot rice with chicken and mushrooms, and a plate of morning glory with fermented bean sauce on the top. It was a great dinner on this Hong Kong food drink. Total price - 71 HKD ($9.15)

23:12 Temple Street Night Market - Temple Street Night Market is one of the old Hong Kong night markets. There’s not a lot to see or do, but it’s a nice place to browse around at night.

Day 35 in Hong Kong was a wonderful day of delicious Hong Kong food and attraction!

Couple finally meet son born to surrogate - BBC News,"In Ukraine, efforts are continuing to unite newborn babies born to surrogate mothers with their biological parents.

Last month officials said that more than a hundred babies had been left stranded in Kyiv after coronavirus restrictions prevented parents from travelling from around the world to Ukraine.

But now some of the red tape has been cut, and special flights laid on. The BBC's Jonah Fisher spoke to one couple who have finally made it to Kyiv to meet their son - ten weeks after he was born.

Epilepsy Care Changes Lives in Liberia,"Amuchin Nango struggled with epilepsy for years while growing up in Monrovia, Liberia. There was little awareness of epilepsy in the country and no treatment was available. The stigma he experienced drove him to drop out of school while he and his family searched for a cure. 

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a project for epilepsy treatment in Monrovia in 2017. A year later, Amuchin was finally receiving the care he needed. He was able to graduate from high school and start a career. ""Now, I'm a classroom teacher,” he said. ""Through the help of MSF, I can stand before students or before people. I'm imparting knowledge now.”

About 80 percent of people with epilepsy live in middle- and low-income countries and three-quarters of them do not receive the treatment they need. Epilepsy is the world’s most common chronic neurological disorder, yet in many places, it remains misunderstood. People living with the disease are often stigmatized and rejected by their communities. For many young people, this can mean forgoing education and participation in society. In Liberia, MSF is helping more than 1,200 patients access epilepsy treatment and overcome social stigma. As part of this effort, MSF staff are helping children return to school after social stigma caused them to drop out. Find out more at https://bit.ly/3gHPQSq

13 Unusual Facts About Females That Are Totally True,"What do we know about women and girls? All of those books on how to understand women have nothing about the biological and social facts of the fairer side of humanity. 
Bright Side looked far and wide to find some pretty awesome and controversial facts about ladies — and here is what we got. 

TIMESTAMPS
Women see more colors. 0:50
The female body has a lower resistance to alcohol. 1:20
Maturity is attractive. 2:04
The average woman will eat 4 lb of lipstick in her lifetime. 2:34
They hate taking risks. 3:07
They might make their men fat. 3:34
Style over comfort. 4:00
A heightened sense of smell. 4:23
The brain cells are packed more densely in the female brain. 4:41
They are the unsung heroes of inventions. 5:41
Heels were for men. 7:36
Women can read faces. 7:57
Long live women! 8:45

SUMMARY
- Women seeing on average 20% more differences in colors and shapes.
- Alcohol is even more dangerous for women as they are more prone to liver disease like hepatitis (an inflammation of the liver) and are more likely to die from liver cirrhosis (a chronic disease).
- Various studies have shown that a woman is more attractive the more fertile she looks, so women who have given birth, grown into a very feminine body, or do not use birth control are way more attractive to men.
- It comes down to women licking off or eating with food about 4 lb of lipstick in their life. That translates to 533.76 lipsticks. 
- The anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that weighs options when making a decision, is larger in women than in men. 
- A lot of men in long-term relationships are getting bigger, and that might be the doing of their women. They go into a “taking care” mode that results in feeding their partner excessively (with the intention of having a strong “warrior” by their side).
- Society and media have been pressing women for centuries to hold themselves to a certain standard.
- The heightened sense of smell helped our ancestors to survive and, as women were mainly gatherers, helped them to pick the right foods for the family.
- The female brain is 9% smaller than its male counterpart. 
- Women over the years have patented: disposable diapers, paper bags, nonreflective glass, the foot-pedal trash can, the dishwasher, and many other innovations.
- Heels were brought into women’s fashion to mimic the men who wore heels as a sign of their masculinity and status.
- Women are better at reading faces, gestures, and voice tones, which makes them superior conversationalists and social leaders. 
- Sometimes the life duration differences between men and women can be up to a decade, but on average it is at least 2–3 years all over the world. 

Even with all that we know about fair ladies, there’s still a ton of mysteries to be unraveled. Which ones are your favorite?

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

30 SMART HACKS FOR EVERYDAY LIFE,"GENIUS TRICKS ONLY A FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT

In this video, I’m showing you some amazing tricks you’ve never seen before. New approached and solutions to those annoying everyday problems.
You can make your own sanitizer by mixing some aloe vera gel with some alcohol. 
To remove build-up from the faucet, apply some ketchup to it, and then distribute it all over. After that remove it with a cloth and voila. 
Instead of trying to apply butter on your toast with a knife, simply grate with it with a cheese grater.

You can make paper bills straight again by ironing them with your hair straightener. 
You can make the music on your phone louder in the bathroom by placing your phone in the sink.

Bitcoin: Will El Salvador's big crypto gamble pay off? – BBC News,"The falling value of Bitcoin is affecting investors all over the world.

It’s putting increased pressure on the Central American state of El Salvador, which nine months ago made cryptocurrency legal tender.

As legal tender it should be accepted in all shops, you can now buy almost anything in Bitcoin, from pizza to real estate.

The government has encouraged people to use Bitcoin by giving $30 to each person who signs up for a government-sponsored Bitcoin wallet – and offering treatment for pets at a cost of just 25 cents for those who pay in Bitcoin.

But aside from some pockets of enthusiasm, people do not seem to be embracing the cryptocurrency as much as their Bitcoin-loving president who is under increasing criticism for investing so much public money in the project.

Indian Street Food in Singapore!! KING OF CHAPATI - Best Food in Little India!!,"🎥 South Indian Food Tour in Bangkok: https://youtu.be/TBS8KzIRiG0
🔔 SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe Don’t miss new food videos!

SINGAPORE - Welcome to Little India in Singapore and today we’re going on a food tour to eat some delicious Indian food - from some of the best chapatis and curry to a full banana leaf meal spread, to the best Indian hawker center street food court I can’t wait to take you on this amazing food tour.

There’s no doubt Singapore is home to an abundance of delicious Indian food - from street food to restaurants. And one of the best places to get started eating Indian food is within Singapore’s vibrant Little India. Here are the places I included in this video:

Azmi Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/AgvgMN1LGom1spAL6) Total price - $19 SGD ($13.87 USD) - You really come here to eat chapati along with tasty accompanying dishes. I had the keema, chicken masala, chickpeas, okra, and chicken fry, all of which was extremely delicious.

Neha Tiffin Centre - Tekka Centre, Singapore - Price - $2 SGD ($1.46 USD) - Unfortunately the place I had really wanted to go to try Indian style fried noodles was closed for the day. So I noticed many people eating dosa from a number of stalls - so that’s what I decided to try. At just $2 it’s one of the most affordable small meals in Singapore. Not the best dosa I’ve had, but overall quite good.

Shifa Drinks Corner - Tekka Centre, Singapore - While eating at Tekka Centre, I met the friendly guys from Shifa Drinks Corner who made a fresh sugar cane juice for me and wouldn’t accept payment. Please go support them when you’re here!

Gandhi Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/14M1gXffK9ArB8JC6) Little India, Singapore - Total price for 2 people - $29 SGD ($21.17 USD) - Finally to complete this Indian street food tour in Little India Singapore we went for a huge South Indian rice and curry meal at Gandhi Restaurant. I tried the yellow rice, chicken masala, fish fry, and a variety of other additional vegetable sides. Food was delicious, and it’s quite a popular place.

Again, Singapore has authentic and extremely delicious Indian food and this is just a start to all the delicious places to try!

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

US President Joe Biden vows to protect women travelling for abortions - BBC News,"US President Joe Biden has said that women travelling for abortions will be protected by the federal government.

Millions of women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in June, after the Supreme Court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision.

Google has also said it is taking steps to remove data from users' location histories that could be used to prosecute people for visits to US abortion clinics.

SUMMARY
-Hares are typically faster and larger than rabbits. Their ears and strong hind legs are also longer, and they have bigger feet.
-Butterflies have club-shaped antennae that look like a thin shaft with a bulbous tip. As for moths, their antennae are either serrated or feathery. 
-You will notice that sheep hold them down whereas the tails of goats proudly stay up. 
-Like all rodents, porcupines have big front teeth. As for hedgehogs, their snouts and teeth are pointy, and they are omnivores, feasting on insects, frogs, plants, and fruit.
-Mature llamas are much larger than alpacas, whose weight typically varies between 100 lb and 170 lb. As for an adult llama, it can weigh as much as 400 lb. 
-Crocodiles are the lucky owners of special glands, which they use to excrete excess salt. As for alligators, their salt glands aren't so well developed. That's why they mostly live in fresh water.  
-Sea lions' flippers are larger and covered with skin. Seals have a thinly webbed flipper, and each small toe has a claw. Seals prefer solitude, and sea lions love gathering in big companies and hanging out with friends.
-Bees are hairy: they need this feature to dip into flowers to collect pollen. Also, their rear legs are flat. Bees look more stocky.
-The skin of most frogs is smooth, while a toad’s skin is thick and bumpy. Frogs' legs are long and slender, and their eyes are big and bulging.
-Most dolphins have pointy faces, curved dorsal fins, and slender bodies. Porpoises have triangular back fins, robust bodies, and rounded faces. 
-Turtles have webbed feet as they live mostly in water, and this makes swimming easier. Also, their shells are lighter and flatter.
-You can find jaguars in Central and South America and sometimes in the southwest of the USA. As for leopards, they dwell in Asia and Africa. Jaguars have smaller spots. Leopards are more slender and a bit smaller than jaguars.

Soft Shell Crab (ปูนิ่มผัดพริกไทยดำ) at Fai Klom Thana Restaurant (ร้านไฟกลมธนา),"Fai Klom Thana, a restaurant in Bangkok, serves a marvelous plate of soft shell crab fried with herbs and chilies. Get all the details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/08/fai-klom-thana-ptt/

Located in northern Bangkok, pretty close to the massive PTT headquarters, which is the state owned oil company in Thailand, is a restaurant called Fai Klom Thana (ร้านไฟกลมธนา). They mostly make stir fried Thai dishes, sort of Chinese influenced, and everything we ate there was quite tasty. The restaurant attracts many people, especially office workers in the nearby buildings. But although Fai Klom Thana (ร้านไฟกลมธนา) is located right in Bangkok, it’s down a quiet neighborhood street, so it really feels like you’re removed from most of the city - so it’s a nice eating environment.

Anyway, we started off with an order of tod man goong (ทอดมันกุ้ง), small shrimp patties, deep fried to a crispy. I’m not usually a huge fan of patties, so these weren’t my favorite - but they were pretty good for what they were. It sort of tasted like a shrimp hot dog to me, which crispy edges - good but not mindblowing. They were served with a sweet dipping sauce that tasted like honey.

Next came a plate of kana pla kem (คะน้าปลาเค็ม), Chinese broccoli stir fried with salted fish. This was probably one of my favorite Thai dishes I ordered at Fai Klom Thana (ร้านไฟกลมธนา). The vegetable was stir fried on just the right high fire, so it was cirp and incredibly fresh tasting. The taste of the salted fish contributed nicely to the flavor, and though it was a bit salty, it was extremely tasty.

Similar to Thai tom yum soup, but a bit different, tom klong pla chon tod (ต้มโคล้งปลาช่อนทอด), was an amazing dish we ate here. The difference between Thai tom yum soup and tom klong pla chon tod (ต้มโคล้งปลาช่อนทอด), is that the ingredients, namely the herbs and spices are first fried before adding them to the soup in tom klong. Anyway, it was extremely flavorful and I could taste the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and those wonderfully fragrant deep fried chilies. The soup was sour, spicy, and extremely soothing.

Ok, finally let’s move on to the boo neem pad prik tai dam (ปูนิ่มผัดพริกไทยดำ), the soft shell crab dish. I had no intention of ordering soft shell crab, but when I saw it on the menu, there was no way I was going to be able to resist - soft shell crab is one of the finest things to eat. The crab was first deep fried, and then it was stir fried with an array of peppers, onions, green peppercorns, and kaffir lime leaves. The soft shell crab (ปูนิ่ม) was so crispy and so flavorful, and what I especially loved was the amazing flavor of the kaffir lime leaves and the strong pungent flavor of the green peppercorns. If there was only one downside, the boo neem pad prik tai dam (ปูนิ่มผัดพริกไทยดำ) was a bit on the salty side, but it was still marvelous delicious and I would definitely eat it again and again.

If you’re ever in the northern part of Bangkok around Chatuchak,  Fai Klom Thana (ร้านไฟกลมธนา) is well worth a stop for lunch or dinner. The food hits the spot.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Gravity Assists,"What is a gravity assist? How does it work? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice discuss how spacecraft use gravity and orbital speed to slingshot to their destination. How do you speed up or slow down without fuel?

Take a trip with Voyager 1 and 2 and how they used gravity assists to generate enough energy to leave the solar system. We uncover the mystery of its effectiveness: shouldn’t the same gravity that pulls you in and speeds you up, pulls you back as you exit? Discover the art of the slingshot, orbital speed, and “planetary mugging.” What happens to a planet’s orbit if you slingshot enough? What’s the official past tense of slingshot? All that, plus, more enlightened analogies from Chuck.

US says Israel and Hamas “on brink” of Gaza ceasefire deal | BBC News,"President Joe Biden has said a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages is ""on the brink"" of coming to fruition and his administration is working urgently to achieve it.

Palestinian officials have confirmed that the terms of a deal are being finalised, while the Israelis said talks are at an advanced stage with a deal possible in hours or days. 

It’s understood that Israel has agreed to release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners including around 190 who have been serving sentences of 15 years or more. In exchange, Hamas will release 34 hostages.

Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of the agreement after which Israel would begin withdrawing  troops from populated areas of Gaza.  Seven days later Hamas would release four additional hostages and Israel would allow displaced people in southern Gaza to return to the north on foot via the coastal road.

The agreement includes provisions for Israeli forces to remain in what’s known as the Philadelphi Corridor and maintain an 800-meter buffer zone along Gaza’s eastern and northern borders during the first phase of the deal lasting 42 days.

Met Police Chief refuses to resign over “heavy handed” handling of Sarah Everard vigil - BBC News,"Dame Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has said she won't resign despite calls for her to step down over the force's handling of a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard. 

She defended the tactics of her officers in trying to clear the area on Clapham Common, in South London, with the police saying the gathering posed a Covid risk. 

Sarah Everard, who was 33, disappeared on her way home in Clapham. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent. 

Critics say police tactics last night were insensitive and heavy handed.

Would You Watch YouTube at 4x Speed?,"This week, Marques and Andrew kicked things off by trying to explain to David the absurdity of the Luka Doncic trade in tech terms that he would understand. After that, it was all about the Pixel 4a battery update issue. Then they discuss a new app that Apple just dropped and a new app that Adam is really excited about. They wrap it all up talking about Meta trying to make the Metaverse happen, YouTube experimenting with 4x speed, and Andrew ranting about streaming services. There was a surprising amount of news to go over despite not having any new gadgets to discuss. Enjoy!

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HQIg3ZwAs0

Ukraine: Evacuating War Wounded by Train,"Since March 31, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has medically evacuated more than 650 patients from war-affected areas in eastern Ukraine to hospitals in safer parts of the country. The war in Ukraine is indiscriminately harming civilians who are struck by heavy weaponry in their homes, shelters, and evacuation routes, according to a report released by MSF, called “No Mercy for Civilians”, which is based on the experiences of patients that we’ve evacuated from eastern Ukraine by train.

Medical data and accounts from these patients and caretakers show that the war in Ukraine is being conducted with an outrageous disregard for civilian lives. This points to a lack of respect for civilian protection, which is a serious violation of international humanitarian law.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

François Chollet is the creator of Keras, which is an open source deep learning library that is designed to enable fast, user-friendly experimentation with deep neural networks. It serves as an interface to several deep learning libraries, most popular of which is TensorFlow, and it was integrated into TensorFlow main codebase a while back. Aside from creating an exceptionally useful and popular library, François is also a world-class AI researcher and software engineer at Google, and is definitely an outspoken, if not controversial, personality in the AI world, especially in the realm of ideas around the future of artificial intelligence.

Is this man a hostage of Russia or a spy? - BBC News,"The British family of a man accused of spying in Moscow has called on the UK government to do more to secure his release. Paul Whelan, who also has US, Irish and Canadian citizenship, has claimed he was set up by a friend, working for Russian intelligence.

He was arrested in December - when Russia claims he was caught ""red handed"" with state secrets. But almost ten months on, Mr Whelan’s lawyers say they’ve seen no evidence of that.

A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have supported Mr Whelan and his family throughout his detention in Moscow, visiting him to check his welfare and attending his appearances in court. We continue to raise our concerns about his treatment with the Russian authorities, who must respect Mr Whelan’s human rights, in line with their international obligations.""

BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports.

On this episode of Roadkill's Junkyard Gold, Steve Magnante is at Desert Valley Auto Parts’s hidden Casa Grande, Arizona lot discovering rust free, but dusty sheet metal.Follow along as Steve uncovers Chevy's first all-coil-spring suspension passenger car, a 1958 Del Ray. But, unlike its upscale Bel Air and Impala siblings, this entry level DelRay has Steve thinking it'd look great reborn as a high riding Gasser. Steve also explores a Canadian-built 1966 Studebaker Wagonaire and a 1967 Coronet R/T that blended road and track and lots of supercar sizzle. But can this once proud 440 Magnum, 4-speed, Dana 60 muscle car be revived? Steve makes the call. There’s all that and even more finds in this episode of Roadkill's Junkyard Gold!",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IFHA129a5I

[Chrous – Kirk Franklin]
Steadfast!  Unmovable!  Always abounding in the…
Steadfast!  (I wanna talk to you) Unmovable!  Always (I wanna talk to you) abounding in the…
(Just blaze!)

We win, yes sir!
We win, yes sir!
And we win, yes sir!
(I believe that) with you by my side (together) we can touch the sky
See we win!

[Verse 1 - Lil Baby]
We will be better than ever
Made a promise we can do it together
And I ain’t breakin my word, 
I just wish that I could fly like a bird
Get away from this earth 
Had to pray a prayer felt I was cursed 
Always tell myself it could’ve been worse, never goin’ back I broke through reverse
It comes from my soul, no need to rehearse
Lot of time I was in need of work, talk to God like I need this to work
Jumped the line like I needed it first but I was being selfish
Know this gon’ affect a lot of people, I was being careless
Took a break and stepped away
I’m coming back when I get ready 
I know this break people into pieces but I ain’t ‘gon let it

[Chorus – Kirk Franklin & Lil Baby]
Steadfast!  (Yo Blaze you crazy for this one)  Unmovable!  Always (Ay) abounding in the…
Steadfast!  (All the champions out there, it feels so good)  Unmovable!  (Ay) Always abounding (I said it feels so good) in the…

We win (we will 5x), yes sir! (we will 5x)
We win (we will 5x), yes sir! (we will 4x) (we gon’ make it!)
And we win (what didn’t break me made me better), yes sir!
(I believe that) with you by my side (together) we can touch the sky
See we win! (Let’s go!)

[Verse 2 - Lil Baby]
Striving for greatness 
At the same time keepin’ my patience
Can’t be racing to no early grave, I’m cool with just pacing
I could drop at any given time,
I’m holdin’ my aces
I’ve seen disappointment all in they faces
The turtle still cross the finish line
We done raised the bar so many times it’s only right they give me mine
Diamond by myself, together we really shine
Long as I keep putting my faith and trust in God I know that everything will be fine
Built for it, real stand-up guy they ain’t never breakin’ my kind
I believe I can do anything
I ain’t never changing my mind (Preach!)
Life’s all about patience, take it one day at a time
Life’s all about patience, take it one day at a time (yeah!)

[Bridge]
Whatever you may be goin’ through (we win!)
We’ll make it together, me and you (and to be clear) (we win!) (Woo!)
And when the clouds they won’t fade away (everybody say!)
Don’t you give up, you’re one step closer it’s not the end (we gon’ make it!)

[Chorus – Kirk Franklin & Lil Baby]
We win (we will 5x), yes sir! (we will 5x) (I believe that…)
We win (we will 5x) (I know that), yes sir! (we will 2x, I ain’t gon’ never let em play me) 
And we win (we will 5x) (yeah)
(I believe that) with you by my side (together) we can touch the sky
See we win! (Let’s go!)

Steadfast!  Unmovable!  Always abounding in the… (we win!)
Steadfast!  Unmovable!  Always abounding in the… (we win!)

Obongjayar - Just Cool (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Obongjayar - Just Cool (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Despite the strife that Obongjayar faced during his childhood in Lagos, Nigeria, his love of music flowered in the dark. As he once told The Guardian, there was only a single radio in the neighborhood, and there he could point his ear towards not only Fela Kuti but 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. Music gave him hope, a window to a way out. At 17, when his family moved to England, his own window opened. So don’t be surprised at the moments when the raspy rhymer’s fusion of West African pop, hip-hop, electronic, and R&B gets more than a little spiritual - triumph is part of the dude's story. Check “Still Sun” from his 2020 ‘Which Way is Forward?’ project, for an eclectic example. In the same vein, there’s a steely ambition to much of Obongjayar's work. “I want it, it’s mine,” he hisses in “Point and Kill,” a reggae-infused Little Simz collaboration. Scroll down to his earliest Spotify release and you’ll find “Creeping,” a somber boom-bap track with Kendrick Lamar influences all the way down to the profound ponderings on love, loss and identity. In the past few years, the singer whose moniker roughly translates to “king junior,"" has been embraced by various UK music communities. King Krule brought him on tour. He’s hopped on tracks with Giggs and Pa Salieu. American rhymer and fellow genre rule-breaker Danny Brown grabbed him for “Belly of the Beast.” We’re also spreading the OB gospel via our DSCVR program. “Message In A Hammer,” from last year’s ‘Some Nights I Dream of Doors’ debut,’ is a kinetic whirlwind, and “Just Cool” shows he’s happy to wrap his arms around pop arrangements. Tap in, OB is good for your spirit.

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Matt Gaetz withdraws as Donald Trump's nominee for US attorney general | BBC News,"Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration to become attorney general after days of debate over whether to release a report on sexual misconduct allegations against him.

On X, formerly Twitter, the 42-year-old said that the controversy over his potential nomination ""was unfairly becoming a distraction"" to the work of the incoming Trump administration.

The report included the findings of a probe sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.

Gaetz has denied the claims but said that he hoped to avoid a ""needlessly protracted Washington scuffle.""

Phoebe Bridgers - Scott Street (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Phoebe Bridgers - Scott Street an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

It’s a real skill to wax forlorn without submitting to the depths of despair. In the last two years Phoebe Bridgers has shown us just how articulate she can be regarding the troubled side of life while still touting the small joys that mark most day to day experiences. Again and again, the singer-songwriter revels in the marvels of the emotional deets that shape who we are. After critics erupted over the eloquence of the 23-year-old’s ‘Stranger In The Alps’ (get the ‘Lebowski’ reference?), the Silver Lake-based Bridgers went through a wave of Joni-Jackson comparisons. Elements of the masters dot her songs, but some of her more recent heroes are Sun Kil Moon’s Mark Kozelek and Elliot Smith – tender wordsmiths whose best work is both vulnerable and poised. If you know Bridgers’ “Smoke Signals” and “Motion Sickness,” you might’ve heard her “Scott Street” before, too. But not like this. Our DSCVR performance turns the tune, inspired by a sunset stroll through her Echo Park hood, into an epic lament. Swirling fiddle lines and cloudy guitar flourishes prove the singer knows exactly what she needs to bolster her designs as she closes with farewell line of “don’t be a stranger.” Masterful.

They're two of a growing number of men who have emerged after joining IS - most have been stripped of their British citizenship.

Lyrics:
You made the rain, so when it falls on me
Should I complain, or feel You calling me
It’s all on me to stay
And really catch what You’re showing
It’s my roots that You’re growing
‘Cause life is more than this moment
You are the light, so when the darkness falls
The greatest heights, they never seem so tall no not at all
You’re right, it’s my roots that You’re growing, don’t wanna miss what You’re showing
 
Ain’t no doubt about You
Everywhere that I go
You keep showing up (Lord You)
Make me wanna shout it
You’re the goodness in my life
And Imma tell You my truth
They may come, they may go
You keep showing up (sure do)
Ain’t no doubt about it
You are, You are
The goodness in my life
 
You are the joy
You’re the smile on the face of Your boy
You’re the flowers at that park in Detroit
Still the words on the back of our coins
Let’s make some noise
You cover me, my defender when You’re rolling up Your sleeves
You’re the truth that’s gonna set the captive free
The only King that’s ever chose to bleed, is what I believe
 
Now they keep trying to make Your glory fade
But I ain’t really sweating what they say
 
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
I can still see the sunshine above me
Lord I love all the ways that You love me
You’re the good, You’re the good, You’re the goodness

Why are peatlands burning in Indonesia? BBC News,"The haze caused by fires in Indonesia has been poisoning the air across much of South East Asia for weeks now.  The fires are deliberately set to clear forests for palm oil plantations. Most of the fires are on peat land which burns for longer and produces more smoke than other fires. Indonesia has laws in place to protect peatland but they are rarely enforced. Rebecca Henschke travelled to Central Kalimantan to find out more.

Yemen facing world’s “worst famine in decades”  - BBC News,"Yemen is at risk of the worst famine the world has seen in decades according to the United Nations.

The UN is warning that 16 million people will go hungry this year, including 400,000 children, who will suffer from severe acute malnutrition and could die without urgent treatment.

Yemen was already the Arab world’s poorest country before its civil war escalated in 2015. Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, control most of the country.

A Saudi-led coalition which is backed by the UK has been carrying out a bombing campaign, in support of Yemen’s internationally-recognised government.

Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by international correspondent Orla Guerin.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Why Science Matters During COVID-19,"In this video, Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice are exploring the value of science and science literacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. It may seem like an obvious fact that science matters during these unprecedented times, but, sometimes it bears repeating. 

Neil explains why the public needs to listen to scientists and why science is true whether you believe it or not. We discuss the public’s tendency to politicize instead of acknowledge science and objective truths. Discover how scientists warning against the pandemic are being treated similar to scientists warning against climate change. 

Neil tells us how this pandemic might permanently change the nature of some people’s conduct and practices in daily life. Lastly, you’ll hear why Neil thinks of the coronavirus as an invader from space. All that, plus, Neil offers a cosmic perspective to help guide you through these tough times.

Hezbollah says Israeli strike killed senior commander in Lebanon | BBC News,"Hezbollah has said one of its senior commanders was killed in an Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon, with the Iran-backed armed group retaliating with a barrage of rockets against Israel.
 
Mohammed Nimah Nasser is the latest senior member of Hezbollah to be targeted by Israel during almost nine months of cross-border violence which have raised fears of an all-out war.
 
Hezbollah said it had launched 100 rockets and missiles at Israeli military positions “as part of the response to the assassination”. The Israeli military said a number of projectiles which fell in open areas sparked fires, but no injuries were reported.
 
The military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah’s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a “large number of terror attacks”.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

A1 x J1 - Latest Trends (Live | Vevo DSCVR),"A1 x J1 - Latest Trends.  An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

They say successful people make good use of their tools. In the case of Joshua Somerkun (J1) and Phinehas ‘Finn’ Waweru (A1), the digital tools were Houseparty, a video chat app which gained popularity during the pandemic, and TikTok, which needs no explanation at this point. The first app connected the two strangers - at the time, J1 lived near London, and A1 was three-hours north in Coventry. The second kickstarted their career. But let’s not neglect the skills that led to the viral explosion of “Latest Trends,” their breakout track. A1 found the chill-yet-bouncy instrumental on YouTube. (“Shoutout Show Beats - he produced the beat,” says Finn.) After weeks of trading ideas and getting to know each other, they delivered the vocals and teased a snippet on TikTok. “People were saying ‘Drop it, drop it… When’s this coming out?’ Then we drop it and it went crazy.” Their ""Baby"" follow-up furthers the duo’s yen for hooky guitar melodies and catchy refrains. The duo's chemistry sizzled under the spotlight of the DSCVR stage; if you didn’t know, you’d think they’d been mates since forever.

GloRilla - Tomorrow (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"GloRilla - Tomorrow - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

If GloRilla was an athlete, she’d be collecting her Rookie of the Year trophy. The rapper’s HitKidd-produced breakout banger “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” dropped on April 29, clobbering the competition and causing double takes with its impact - the GloRillafication of hip-hop 2022 was swift and deep. Some fans were caught scratching their heads: surely this brash anti-guy anthem has been around longer than just one summer? Extending the athlete metaphor, the Memphis native’s primary strength is her hard-hitting flow. Almost every line from the GRAMMY nominated “F.N.F.” works as a punchy example, but “at the red light/twerkin' on them headlights'' paints a vivid picture. Glo’s got a voice that seems drenched in Southern Comfort, a laconic murmur that lives in low-register land and packs a wallop when it strikes. Accurate comparisons have been drawn to Cardi B; hot on the heels of “F.N.F.,” it wasn’t surprising when the duo’s “Tomorrow 2” collab debuted in the Billboard Top 10. Add in “Blessed” and combine them all and you’ll find Glo’s three major videos clocking in the 100-million-views territory. Makes sense that Yo Gotti jumped on signing the 23-year-old to his CMG imprint, the South’s hottest rap label of the moment. Labelmate Moneybagg Yo called her the perfect “puzzle piece.” Another young and influential Memphis figure who’s diminutive frame belies his explosive power is Memphis Grizzlies star hooper Ja Morant, who won NBA rookie of the year in 2020. The Griz’ arena is only a few miles from the Frayser neighborhood where GloRilla grew up. This year the team invited Glo, who was raised as Gloria Woods, to narrate their season hype video. At the end of it she summarizes how we all feel about her: “What’s understood, don’t gotta be explained. This is big Memphis.”

Living under house arrest in Putin's Russia - BBC News,"Russian activist Anastasia Shevchenko is facing six years in prison for her opposition political activism.

Anastasia has been under strict house arrest awaiting trial for over a year – banned from communicating with anyone other than officials and her relatives.

Those conditions have just been eased slightly, allowing her to talk about her case to the BBC for the first time.

She’s accused of links to a pro-democracy group Open Russia UK, which has been banned in Russia as ‘undesirable’ and a ""threat to state security"".

BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford went to meet Anastasia.

Heaven

You made a path for me to walk
Paved with blood and mercy 
So I will a grateful heart
No matter what the journey 
I know You’re with me as I go
I never left Your side
And though I’m not yet home 
You lead me to the other side

I’m hearing the tension now
My feet are on solid ground
And I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
I’m here in the in-between
I’m reaching for what’s unseen
Yeah I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
My head is in Heaven 

And every blessing that I have
Is a blessing from above
I know I often forget it 
But You don’t hold back your love
And I’m thankful for the moments
I get to feel You so close
And even when I am hurting
I know I’m never alone

I’m hearing the tension now
My feet are on solid ground
And I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
I’m here in the in-between
I’m reaching for what’s unseen
Yeah I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
My head is in Heaven 

I’m in two places at one time, one time
I’m in two places at one time, one time 
I’m in two places at one time, one time
I’m in two places at one time, one time

I’m hearing the tension now
My feet are on solid ground
And I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
I’m here in the in-between
I’m reaching for what’s unseen
Yeah I don’t mind confessing
My head is in Heaven
My head is in Heaven 

I’m in two places at one time, one time
I’m in two places at one time, one time
I’m in two places at one time, one time
I’m in two places at one time, one time

I’m in two places at one time
My head is in Heaven

Gisèle Pelicot condemns men accused in France mass rape trial | BBC News,"Gisèle Pelicot has denounced the mass rape case of 51 men as a ""trial of cowardice"" on her final day of evidence.
 
Pelicot, who has attended the mass rape trial from its start in September, was questioned by defence lawyers after the last defendant in the case, Philippe L, left the dock.
 
She has waived her right to anonymity so the entire trial can be heard in court in Avignon in the full glare of publicity.
 
Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, has admitted recruiting dozens of men online to rape her over almost a decade at their home in Mazan.

Lyrics:
If love starts with listening 
We didn’t come here to just sing 
We’re moving everything 
Everything out of Your way
 
If faith worships while it waits 
We will take our time to praise
We’re moving everything 
Everything out of Your way
 
We’re making room 
For a miracle from You
All we want is your presence 
Turn this room into Heaven 
We call Your name
 
We’re making space 
For the miracle of change 
All we want is Your presence  
Turn this room into Heaven
We call Your name 
 
If praise is where you choose to stay 
Let our lives be one refrain 
We’re giving everything 
Everything now and always 
 
Move in, move in, move in
Come release Your presence 
Your fire, Your wind 
Come receive your 
Praises, praises, praises
Holy Spirt come 
 
Move in, move in, move in
Come release Your presence 
Your fire, Your wind 
Come receive your 
Praises, praises, praises
Holy Spirit come

50+ Things That Blew People's Minds in the '80s,"It might sound unbelievable, but we’re closer to 2050 than 1980.  Oy.  And though the 80s may be ancient, for some of us, they’re alive in our souls. How about returning to the 1980s, with its parachute pants, aerobic workouts, and ridiculous hair when the world population was just under 4.5 billion, and the yearly cost to attend Harvard was just 10 thousand dollars? What was special about the 1980s?

Well, in 1980, the Rubik’s Cube debuted internationally. (By the way, originally, the Rubik’s Cube was named “Magic Cube”.)  In 1982, the first emoticons were invented. In 1985, the first Nintendo home game console is launched in North America. In 1988, Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” was published. In 1989 “The Simpsons” aired. Yup, it’s the longest-running American sitcom. Interested? Then let's find out more about things that happened in the 80s!

TOBi - Family Matters (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"TOBi - Family Matters. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Born in Nigeria and raised in the Toronto suburbs, Oluwatobi Feyisara Ajibolade grew up on everything from Marvin Gaye to Fela Kuti to A Tribe Called Quest. It’s easy to hear those influences in his own music. In the last two years TOBi has released two projects: 'Still' and 'ELEMENTS,' the first incorporating more boom-bap hip-hop beats then its successor. “City Blues,” from ‘Still,’ is a rainy portrait of street lethargy carrying enough rap bonafides for The Game himself to hop on a remix for the album’s deluxe edition. TOBi's sound has subtly shifted between the two projects. 'ELEMENTS' goes deeper into the experimental R&B, electro-pop and soul that 'Still' danced around. “I want people to know that I love all these kinds of music,” he’s said. “I look at it like the beat is a canvas and I’m the painter. I’m going to express myself however I want.” Presenting a picture - whether literally, figuratively or with the mood his music creates - is what separates TOBi from the pack. Dial up the “Made Me Everything” video. Uplifting, frenetic, packed with choreography and tennis, it instantly turns viewers into fans. It also has the power to get listeners through a tough day. The singer brought that good vibe to the DSCVR studio, too. “Made Me Everything” retains its infectious buzz, and “Family Matters” resounds with the rap swag he’s always able to tap. No surprise, he truly commanded the room all on his own.

Farther and Faster: NASA's Journey to the Moon with Artemis,"At 1:47 a.m. EST (6:47 UTC) on Nov. 16, 2022, NASA’s Orion spacecraft launched atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket from historic Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a path to the Moon, officially beginning the Artemis I mission.
 
Over the course of 25.5 days, Orion performed two lunar flybys, coming within 80 miles (129 kilometers) of the lunar surface. At its farthest distance during the mission, Orion traveled nearly 270,000 miles (435,000 kilometers) from our home planet. On Dec. 11, 2022, NASA’s Orion spacecraft successfully completed a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 9:40 a.m. PST (12:40 p.m. EST) as the final major milestone of the Artemis I mission.
 
Artemis I set new performance records, exceeded efficiency expectations, and established new safety baselines for humans in deep space. This is a prelude to what comes next—following the success of Artemis I, human beings will fly around the Moon on Artemis II.
 
We have demonstrated our ability to go farther and faster than ever before, opening the door to explore Mars and other destinations throughout the solar system. This is the story of Artemis I.

How to Choose The Perfect Jeans For Your Body Type,"The perfect pair of jeans should fit well, hide your body’s drawbacks, and emphasize your best features. Here is a cheat sheet to help you choose the best-fitting and most flattering pair of jeans.

Sometimes it’s extremely hard to choose the right pair of jeans because there are so many different kinds. When being in a department store, we rarely pay attention to the descriptions about the rise and fit of jeans. But when we have to choose a pair from a shop online we have to be very aware of our waistlines and how loose jeans should fit on our bodies. In this article, you’ll find out what kinds of jeans exist and which types will fit your body best.

18 BATH CRAFTS THAT ARE ABSOLUTE LIFESAVERS,"AWESOME BATH CRAFTS

I simply love handmade soap! This time I wanna tell you how to make Amethyst crystal soap.

Cut up 50 ounces of Ultra Clear Soap Base and add it to the 5 Quart Mixing Bowl. Melt in the microwave using 30 second to 1 minute bursts as many times as needed until completely melted.
Once the soap is completely melted, pour 16 ounces of the melted soap into a smaller measuring cup and set the rest of the soap aside.

TIP: Pre-warm the measuring cup in the microwave for about 30 seconds so the soap doesn’t cool drastically when transferred.
Using a dropper, add 3 drops of Tropical Purple LabColor to the 16 ounces of soap and stir until completely combined.

Add 12 mL of the Amethyst Fragrance Oil to the purple soap and stir until completely blended.
Pour most of the melted purple soap to the mold. Reserve about 4-6 ounces in the container, and add 3 more drops of the Tropical Purple LabColor to the rest of the melted soap for a more vibrant purple color.

Pour the rest of the dark purple soap into the lighter color purple already in the mold. With a spoon or spatula, swirl the soap around a little bit. Spritz with alcohol to get rid of bubbles.
Let the soap cool and harden until it forms a skin. Then, dust on a fine sprinkling of Fine Silver Rainbow EcoGlitter on top.

Add 18 mL of Amethyst Fragrance Oil to the remaining uncolored soap. Stir until fully incorporated.
Once the soap is the correct temperature, spritz the purple soap with alcohol. Pour some of the clear soap into the purple soap slowly. Reserve about 8 ounces of clear soap. Spritz with alcohol once more.

TIP: It’s very important at this point to keep track of temperatures. The idea is to have the clear soap warm enough to penetrate the purple soap that is already in the mold. The ideal temperature for the purple soap in the mold is around 120° F, and the ideal temperature for the clear soap in the bowl that you’re about to pour is around 135°.

At this point, the remaining soap may have cooled and hardened. If so, heat up the soap in the microwave again for 20-30 seconds to make it fluid. When it’s liquid again, add two.15 CC Mini Scoops of Super Pearly White Mica to the reserved clear melt and pour.
Spritz the soap in the mold with alcohol again and carefully pour the white soap onto the clear soap in the mold. It will penetrate into the clear soap, so be mindful not to pour too high or too fast. Spritz with alcohol to eliminate bubbles, and let completely dry and harden for several hours up to overnight.
Enjoy your Amethyst soap! ; )

What If All Metals On Earth Became Liquid?,"There're so many objects surrounding us that're made of metal. Our phones, teapots, cars, parts of buildings, bridges and so much more... But what if everything made of metal started to melt? What if all metals on Earth lost their solid form? 

Rivers of liquid metal would fill the streets. The objects surrounding us would drain down. At some point it would get completely silent. As car horns, the noise from the highway, sirens, exhaust fumes, and engine roars – all of it would disappear. How would we restore our civilization?

Donald Trump calls Joe Biden’s official pardon of son Hunter ‘an abuse’ | BBC News,"US President-elect Donald Trump has called Joe Biden’s decision to officially pardon his son Hunter “an abuse” and “a miscarriage of justice”.

The outgoing president made the decision despite previously saying that he wouldn’t interfere with the US justice department’s decisions.

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.

In a statement, President Biden said his son had been ""singled out”.

Hunter Biden said mistakes he made during the darkest days of his addiction had been ""exploited to publicly humiliate and shame"" his family.

"Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv, Ukraine - BBC News","Residents in Yahidne, near Chernihiv, have told the BBC Russian troops held 130 people in a basement for four weeks.

Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He said he couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old.

He tied himself to a railing using his scarf to sleep standing up for 25 nights.

When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed.

This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside.

40 BRILLIANT TRAVEL HACKS,"TRAVEL HACKS

People love camping and traveling! And I want to help you make this time most comfortable and fun possible with these hacks.
I often faced this problem on the beach. When you need to take off your swimming panties wet from the water but all dressing booths are occupied and you're in a hurry, no time to wait. I got you! Check out the way to take off your panties without taking your shorts or pants off.

Take your scissors and cut them on the both sides. Then sew 2 swimming bra locks on the cut edges of your bikini accordingly. Voila! Now all you need to do next time you're on the beach is unlock these locks and remove your panties with a mere flick of your wrist. 

Simple and genius way to deal with sweat - take off your bra and apply 1 hygienic pad to each bra cup.
Another handy hack is trash sorting. Here's how you do it. Take a trash bucket, then add 3 bags of different colors. Keep them together using 4 clothing pegs.

If you need to go out light, hands free but don't know where to put your keys at, I've got an idea. Make a shoelace key holder. It's very neat. You can run or jump or just walk fast and nothing will happen with the key.

If you like to make lunch breaks or brunches with your friends in the open air, here's an idea for a foil dinnerware. Take a piece of foil and wrap it round the bowl or can, any vessel of needed volume. Then take a foil of, it'll have the form of your bowl, now you can use it as usual.

Did you know that you can use a condom as a fire starter? Now you do! Check out the details in the video! ; )

Why monuments in the US are being taken down - BBC News,"Council leaders in a Mississippi city named after President Andrew Jackson have voted to remove a statue of him, in the latest move to reconsider statues of people with ties to slavery or the Confederacy.

There has been long debate around many of the statues being discussed, but it was recently ignited again after the death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter marches.

The removal of statues isn't just happening in the US. The statue of Winston Churchill in London's Parliament Square was vandalised and was later boarded up for protection, while statues of King Leopold II have been removed in Belgium.

CAPSTONE is scheduled to launch on June 28 at 5:55 a.m. EDT (9:55 UTC) on a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from the company’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. Watch live June 28 at 5 a.m. EDT (9 UTC) on NASA TV and on NASA social media. Live broadcast: https://youtu.be/JGx400xCDVY

The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides.

17 Foods You Can't Buy in Some Countries at Any Price,"Every country has its customs and … a list of banned food ingredients.  Yep.  Things you can always find on the shelf of your local grocery store might be off limits somewhere else in the world. That’s not just a cultural phenomenon, but a matter of health and safety. 

For example, in Europe and Great Britain, selling chicken treated with chlorine has been banned since 1997. Since 2010, chlorinated chicken has also been banned in Russia. Farmed salmon is banned from a list of countries, including Australia and New Zealand. Raw, or unpasteurized milk, is so common in Europe, especially in Austria and Switzerland, you can buy it from a vending machine there. However, it’s been banned in about half of the United States for the past thirty years. So you guys might want to reconsider your list the next time you go shopping.

SUMMARY:
- According to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, cereal bars contain an excess of “toxic” substances, which can have an adverse effect on children’s livers and kidneys if consumed regularly. 
- According to a study published in Science Direct in 2016, 82% of all grown soybeans are genetically modified. 
- Quite often, the meat of cattle, pigs, and turkeys is produced with ractopamine. Scientists believe that this meat can be harmful for people and lead to cardiovascular diseases.
- Potato chips containing olestra, a synthetic fat substitute, are banned in Canada and Europe. It doesn’t add fat, calories, or cholesterol. 
- An inspection conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2014 found that 80% of apples contain diphenylamine. In Europe, DPA is considered to be a harmful substance that may cause cancer.
- The two preservatives many chewing gums contain: BHA and BHT, are banned in Japan and parts of the European Union.
- According to the European commission, gelatin sweets in small cups are extremely dangerous for children because they’re a choking hazard.
- Brominated vegetable oil is the main ingredient in orange colored soda and is a toxic poisonous chemical. 
- Certain kinds of boxed pasta, frozen dinners and packaged baked goods contain azodicarbonamide (also known as ADA, E927). It’s banned in Europe and Australia.
- To produce instant mashed potatoes, butylated hydroxyanisole (ВНА or Е320, to make it easier) is often used. The National Institutes of Health conducted several studies and concluded that this preservative is potentially harmful to human health.
- A lot of foods, from cereals and baked goods, to candy and soda, have artificial dyes in them. They do make food look prettier, but they’re produced out of chemicals derived from petroleum. 
- Consuming trans fats may lead to metabolism issues, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases. The highest percentage of trans fats are found in margarine.

Trump impeachment: The Republicans' dilemma - BBC News,"Donald Trump is about to stand trial in the US Senate for his role in the riot at the Capitol on 6 January.

The former president is the first in US history to have been charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of US Congress.

Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party.

Ros Atkins looks at the decisions Republicans face.

Attack on #rafah #gaza would be devastating  #doctorswithoutborders,"A full-scale attack on Rafah would have devastating consequences for the 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering there. Before the war started over 4 months ago, Rafah had a population of just over 250,000. Now, tents have sprawled, and people are living in dire, overcrowded conditions. Food, water, medicines, and other essentials are scarce. Rafah is the end of the line. An attack on the last refuge in Gaza will be catastrophic. #ceasefirenow",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dbssE4bGwI
Cocoa Girl: 'We made the first UK black girls' magazine' - BBC News,"During lockdown, six-year-old Faith and her mother Serlina searched for magazines that represented children like her.

The realisation that there was a lack of diversity in magazines for younger girls led them to embark on designing and printing the first ever UK magazine for black girls aged seven to 14.

Since publication, Cocoa Girl has experienced a surge in sales, selling more than 11,000 copies since it launched in June - at a time when print magazine sales are in decline.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, futurist, and professor at the City College of New York. He is the author of many fascinating books on the nature of our reality and the future of our civilization.

Unblocking India's sewers... by hand - BBC News,"It's dirty work but somebody has got to do it - except that the practice of people removing human excrement and sewage with their bare hands was made illegal in India 25 years ago.

That doesn't mean people have stopped doing it. It’s called ‘manual scavenging’ and the Indian government estimates that there are about 600,000 ‘manual scavengers’ in the country.

Official estimates say that one worker dies every five days in India doing this type of work – but campaigners have told Newsnight this is the tip of the iceberg as many deaths go unreported.

James Clayton reports.

20 Things I Finally Learned How to Do Right,"Most of us have been using the toilet incorrectly. The right way is to squat, like a deep squat, rather than sitting on it. It's actually the way our ancestors used to do it before modern toilets. Squatting helps prevent straining, which can be harmful to your digestive system. As shocking as it sounds, it is like that with many everyday things we all do wrong. If you want to learn to do the most basic things the proper way, this video is for you.

Boris Johnson makes first speech as new PM - BBC News,"Boris Johnson has said ""his job is to serve the people"" as he becomes the UK's new prime minister.
Speaking outside Downing Street after accepting The Queen's invitation to form a government, he said he wanted to ""change the country for the better"".
He said the UK would leave the EU on 31 October ""no ifs, no buts"", adding: ""The buck stops with me.""
Mr Johnson took over after Theresa May handed in her resignation to the Queen a short time ago.
The new PM will then begin putting together his cabinet - a number of Mrs May's senior ministers have already resigned, having said they could not serve under him.
As she relinquished power after three years, Mrs May said being prime minister had been ""the greatest honour"" and wished her successor well.

Daily vlogging was not the original plan, but we quickly fell in love with it and now post a video every day! About halfway through the year, we knew we weren’t going to be ready to stop traveling in December, so now we have a new goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019! On our channel you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit ;)

LYRICS:
Everything’s a mess right now
Not the way it’s supposed to be
It’s hard to see a God that’s good
In a world that’s full of tragedy

Cause my head pounds with questions
These thoughts won’t go away
And all I’ve got left are the words I never say

Why’s it gotta feel so heavy?
Why’s it gotta break my heart?
Why is everybody so empty?
Why do good things fall apart?
(Tryin a fix what’s fallin apart)
I know there’s gotta be some answers
Someone’s gotta tell me the truth 
Why’s it gotta be so heavy?
God I gotta give it to You

These eyes distort reality 
The madness only weighs me down 
My soul’s living in poverty
Oh God have you been holding out

Cause my head pounds with questions
These thoughts won’t go away
And all I’ve got left are the words I never say

I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
Even when it ain’t so easy
I surrender 
I surrender 
I surrender
(Cause) In the letting go you free me

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Ready:

You tell me that you’re ready but you just don’t know 
My eyes are getting heavy and it’s starting to show
Never seen it coming, never seen a thing,
Maybe I’ll get through what’s ever coming to me.

Cause I’ve been so unlucky I don’t know what to say,
Running out of money I’ve been wasting away, 
I never seen it coming never seen a thing,
Maybe I’ll get through what’s ever coming to me.

We fall,
We fall down,
If we fall, 
We fall down,
If we fall down hard I’ll be ready to grow.

I’m ready,
I’m ready for it,
I’m ready,
I’m ready for it,
I’m ready,
I’m ready for it all.

Look me in the eye when I am talking to you
It’s easy to get nervous I’ve been feeling it too
Yeah it’s kind of crazy, yeah it’s kind of dumb 
But never let the pressure overpower the fun

Yeah I’m sure your parents probably said it to you
Follow what you love and you will love what you do
And never let the pressure tell you that you’re not 
Capable of being everything that you want.

We fall,
We fall down,
If we fall, 
We fall down,
If we fall down hard I’ll be ready to grow.

I’m ready,
I’m ready for it,
I’m ready,
I’m ready for it,
I’m ready,
I’m ready for it all

"Race, Criminal Justice and Health | The Forum at HSPH","The focus on racial injustice in the US – particularly the effect of race on criminal justice – has been in the public spotlight following the tragic deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner on Staten Island, and Tamir Rice in Cleveland during encounters with law enforcement. While these inequities play out in numerous areas, health and well-being is one sector in which minority groups are dramatically and disproportionally affected. This Forum event examined how disparities within the law and the criminal justice system negatively affect health in members of minority groups — as well as how the role of race interacts with neighborhood environments, educational and employment opportunities, public policy, and other factors to lead to poorer health in minority populations. 

This event was presented February 6, 2015 in Collaboration with Reuters.

Closely planned US raid kills Islamic State leader - BBC News,"The leader of the Islamic State is dead following a US raid in northern Syria that also killed a senior deputy of the terror group, US officials say.

Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi set off a blast killing himself and his family as special forces rounded on his hideout after a gunfight.

US President Joe Biden disclosed the overnight raid on Thursday.

Qurayshi's death ""removed a major terrorist threat to the world"", Mr Biden said.

US officials did not name the IS deputy also killed, but provided dramatic details of the operation that had been months in the planning.

IS has so far made no public comments on the issue.

What Actually Happened to the Most Beautiful Woman,"She captivated millions on both sides of the Atlantic. She was even dubbed “the most beautiful woman that ever lived.” Her life behind the scenes was as enigmatic as her image on screen. So, what ever happened to silent-film star Greta Garbo after all that success?

The Swedish actress never really liked talking to the press. You know what she famously said when asked about her personal life? “I was born. I had a mother and father. I went to school. What does it matter?” And still, her younger days in Sweden affected her deeply. If not for them, she probably wouldn’t have found her calling at all...

Mata Hari (1931) Promo shot of Greta Garbo: By Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/picture/id/59765170/i/0/t/0
Animation is created by Bright Side.

SUMMARY:
- Her dad passed, leaving her family of now 4 in unimaginable financial hardship. She desperately had to earn a living, so she started working at a department store. 
- Once she started acting in commercials in 1920, her path to the big screen was now wide open. 
- Greta enrolled in acting school at Stockholm’s Royal Dramatic Theater. When she graduated in 1924, she was discovered by one of Sweden’s leading directors, Mauritz Stiller.
- He was also the one who insisted she use a stage name. After all, “Gustafsson” didn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and the difficult pronunciation would make the aspiring actress’s name hard to remember.
- And soon enough, her fame would go trans-Atlantic. In 1925, the famous American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offered Stiller to work in Hollywood.
- But it was a time when talent wasn’t enough for an actress to become a big star. Garbo was forced to lose weight and learn English, her hair was dyed, her teeth were fixed, and her eyebrows were tweezed into thin threads. 
- In 1926, Garbo played a Spanish singer in her first American film called Torrent. It was a hit.
- Most of Garbo’s films were love stories or dramas, and her unique performance on screen combined both passion and restraint.
- Despite being one of Hollywood’s major idols, she didn’t attend movie premieres, talk to reporters, or sign autographs.
- In 1930, she made her debut in the sound film Anna Christie. Her raspy sound fascinated people no less than her gaze that could replicate dozens of emotions. The picture was once again well received.
- According to TIME, she was the top-paid actor in 1934, with a whopping $500,000 salary! 
- In 1941, she appeared in Two-Faced Woman. The critics called the story silly, and it was a flop. The film’s failure supposedly hurt the actress’s self-esteem tremendously. 
- She moved to Manhattan, where she’d take long strolls down the streets of New York wearing huge sunglasses to not be spotted. 
- And although she wasn’t making movies anymore, she hadn’t given up on art entirely. She turned to collecting paintings and bought the works of Jawlensky, Renoir, and many others.
- Greta Garbo died in 1990 at the age of 84. As biographer Barry Paris put it, she was an anomaly.

"Summer Walker - ""Karma"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Summer Walker – “Karma” Live Performance | Vevo
 
Summer Walker needs love. She sings all about it in her aptly titled, “Girls Need Love.” But while her song lyrics sizzle with sex appeal, the Atlanta newcomer’s artistry is also in need of affection. Her 2018 debut, ‘Last Days of Summer,’ brims with old school heartache and millennial panache. That combination, combined with Walker’s swagger and forthright personality, just might help her capture 2019’s It Girl crown. Recently, Vevo connected with her for cool performances of “Girls Need Love” and “Karma” from the ‘Last Days’ album. The former got a boost this year by way of a Drake verse for the remix. Add that material to her new EP, ‘Clear,’ and your cold winter nights will feel a bit warmer.

Last Trail! From Truckee up through Fordyce Creek Trail - Ultimate Adventure 2016,"Part 5 of Ultimate Adventure 2016. You often save the best for last. In the case of Ultimate Adventure, you save the most challenging for last…which in our minds is the best. So, technically we’re still saving the best for last. We left Truckee, California, the morning of Day 6 and wound our way past Donner Lake and up through Donner Pass….with plenty of food in the coolers. After topping the tanks and airing down, we nosed into the last trail of UA2016. And what a last trail the Fordyce Creek Trail turned out to be! It starts out pretty slow and mellow, but before long the scenery and terrain become exponentially more incredible. Big winch hills and deep water crossings are this trail’s forte. And before the sun fell on our first day on Fordyce Creek Trail, we’d nearly laid several rigs on their sides, overheated some, and left a bunch of rubber on rocks. Skinny pedal throttle action anybody? Good, because it’s here. On Day 7, we awoke next to a rushing river at Committee Crossing before wading through to the other side and breaking some parts. Nobody get out of UA without some kind of malady. Whether it’s a blown up engine, fragged axleshafts, dented sheetmetal, or even a stubbed toe, carnage is the word of the day. And this year’s UA was no exception. See if you favorite rig makes it out alive. For more action, videos, pictures check out www.4wor-ua.com.

Angie Rose - Infatuation (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Angie Rose - Infatuation. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

Vibrant and proud like the Bronx streets she’s repped since childhood, Angie Rose embodies everything great about the Boogie Down borough. The child of Puerto Rican parents, she wields diversity like a creative tool - carving her music into colorful reflections of her experiences and attitudes. Her message resonates: the feminine anthem “Fight Like A Man” racked up over a million views last year. A proud NYC Latina, many of her pop spirituals weave English and Spanish together. Her faith plays a major role in her identity, and her fashion design skills also rounds out her persona. Her brand - Unstoppable - defines everything you need to know about her. We knew had to put Angie Rose on to more people, so a DSCVR invitation was sent. In an exclusive studio performance, she winds her way through a flamenco version of “Infatuation” and kills her update of “Lie To Me (Story of Eve).” Prepare to be inspired.

Fascinating 3D Journey to the Ocean Depths,"Ever wanted to take a dive into the deepest parts of the ocean? Well, today you’re gonna have this opportunity! Now, how good are you at holding your breath?  Not that good? Well not to worry. Hop on board of our submersible craft and join us in the voyage to the depths! Ready? Let’s dive! We're gonna see a lot of interesting things.

For example, at the depth of 2,723 ft, we'll reach the point where the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, would not even show its tip on the surface if it were put underwater. At 3,600 ft, there’s West Mata — one of the deepest ocean volcanoes in the world. At 7,400 ft we’ll be saying goodbye to sperm whales — this is the deepest point they can dive. And at 15,000 ft, the monsters out of your worst nightmares pop up...

"A voice note on what happened in #Gaza: March 18, 2025","Doctors Without Borders teams are responding to influxes of patients in southern and central Gaza. In the early hours of March 18, Israeli forces attacked multiple areas in the Gaza Strip, after almost two months of an already-fragile ceasefire. Hundreds of people have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health. Claire Nicolet, MSF head of emergencies, gave this voice note today:

Hidden cameras capture Thai tigers  - BBC News,"This year 79 tigers were captured on hidden cameras in Thailand’s Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng forest, which is an increase of more than 70% from 13 years ago. The forest accounts for half of the country’s tiger population.

According to the WWF, wild tiger numbers are starting to gradually increase globally. Tiger populations are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China. An estimated 3,900 tigers remain in the wild, but in some areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tiger numbers are declining.

BBC Thai spoke to researcher Sompoch Duangchantrasiri about why it is important to keep the big cats in Thailand’s forests.

"Never Use a Stopped Escalator As a Stairway, Here's Why","Using a stopped escalator as stairs might seem harmless, but it can actually be risky! First off, escalator steps are taller and deeper than regular stairs, so it's easy to lose your footing or trip. Plus, escalators are designed to move, so their steps don’t have the same grip as normal stairs, making them more slippery. When the escalator isn’t working, it can also be unstable, especially if there’s a sudden fix or maintenance happening. There’s also a chance that the escalator could start moving again suddenly if it’s not fully shut off, which would be a big surprise! For safety, it’s better to use regular stairs or an elevator if the escalator is out of service.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, and Thai agricultural workers Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Seathao and Surasak Lamnao were freed in the exchange on Thursday.

Government to ask Queen to suspend Parliament - BBC News,"The Queen will be asked by the government to suspend Parliament just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it will make way for Boris Johnson's new administration to hold a Queen's Speech - laying out the government's plans - on 14 October.

But it means MPs are unlikely to have time to pass any laws that could stop the prime minister taking the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.

Tory backbencher and Remain campaigner Dominic Grieve called it ""an outrageous act"", and warned it could lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson, adding: ""This government will come down.""

But a No 10 source defended the move, saying: ""It's time a new government and new PM set out a plan for the country after we leave the EU.""

The Rise of the Right: Populism in Germany - BBC News,"A new wave of far-right politics is sweeping across Europe, promising to smash the ruling elite, end migration and shake-up the EU. But are these parties fuelling hate?
 
The Nine’s Europe Correspondent Jean Mackenzie travels across the continent, to find out why these movements are surging - meeting the people celebrating their rise and those fighting to stop them. 
 
The first in this series comes from Germany, where the far-right party the AfD is now Germany’s main opposition. We ask whether their place in Parliament is emboldening more extreme groups.

"Avocado Is Really Good for You, But Not on Toast","Is avocado toast your favorite breakfast option? Well then, I have some bad news for you: Avocado toast isn't the right choice for your breakfast meal for several reasons, and both components here are to blame.  Avocados do contain B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are good for your health. But because they're a fruit, they don't meet one important criterion for the ""ideal breakfast choice"" title - they are super low in protein. There are some other foods that are healthy and nice but won't give you enough energy to kickstart your day.

This is how to store human knowledge for eternity - BBC News,"It’s easy to assume that human knowledge is stable – that everything we have learnt will endure for millennia. Yet oral history can evolve as it passes between generations, books can be destroyed, and digital storage is more fragile and transient than many assume. The hard drives and servers that underpin our world today will eventually become unreadable as the years pass. Our storage methods may serve us well now, but they are far from immortal. So, where and how should we store humanity’s knowledge for posterity? There is one way: use the fundamental code of life itself.

23 HACKS MCDONALD'S DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED,"CRAZY FOOD FACTS

Professional food photographers have a lot of secrets on how to make perfect photos to attract consumers to buy fast food. It’s not magic, the tricks are really easy and cool. We share some of the secrets on how to make perfect food photos. 
Here are mind-blowing photo tricks you need to know:
-    When you buy French fries, they look so disappointing. To make a perfect photo of French fries you will need kitchen sponge and toothpicks
-    It’s really hard to make a good photo of a cake as cream melts so fast and layers look not so good. To make a perfect photo of a cake the layers are replaced with bread. And cardboard is used to keep cake layers dry. The same trick is used to make a perfect photo of sandwiches. Whipped cream is usually replaced with shaving foam and toothpick is used to secure a cherry
-    Same situation we have with an ice-cream as it’s really difficult to make a photo of an ice-cream as it melts so fast. Instant mashed potatoes are usually used instead of ice-cream. Sounds crazy? Mashed potatoes are usually colored with food coloring
-    Baby powder is used to give grapes matte look 
-    Photographers add aspirin to soft drinks to look them refreshing and fizzy
Learn how to check the quality of the food: a few drops of iodine will show if the mayonnaise you bought in the supermarket is natural. A glass of hot water will help you to distinguish real butter from margarine. As high-quality butter is made from cream or milk and it will melt in water, unlike the margarine.
Finally, you will find weird but cool recipes of black ice-cream and vegan caviar.

Trayvon Martin's legacy and Black Lives Matter - BBC News,"Back in 2012, a young black American was shot and killed while walking through a gated community in Florida. His name was Trayvon Martin, and his killer was George Zimmerman, a white neighbourhood watch volunteer. Trayvon, who was only 17, was not armed, and his death led to huge national protest. George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder, claiming that he was acting in self-defence. It was an extraordinary case that first prompted the slogan, Black Lives Matter. Well, five years on, the parents of Trayvon Martin have written a book on the case and Mark Urban has been in the US to speak to them.

SUMMARY:
-Infestations usually start in the kitchen, especially in those dark hard-to-clean spaces behind and under cabinets and appliances.
-Try tucking bay leaves or leaving a clump in those hard-to-clean places. This method may take a lot of bay leaves and patience, but it’s a nice natural way to send roaches packing. 
-You can use garlic- or onion powder, and sprinkle it in and around their favorite hangout spots.
-The lemon juice will effectively repel these pests, and your kitchen will smell amazing too!
-Just fill a medium-sized spray bottle with mostly vinegar, and add enough drops of peppermint essential oil so that you can smell it. Spray your kitchen and bathroom. 
-Neem oil keeps away a lot of insects and pests because it contains a certain chemical that’s poisonous to them.
-Cockroaches and similar pests breathe through the pores of their shells and skin, so when they start crawling around in this soap, the borax will get the job done. 
-Put some fresh catnip leaves in a sachet – you know, those little sheer drawstring bags usually used for steeping tea – or other porous bag. Cockroaches can’t stand it. 
-Once you’ve put the traps together, place them in the spots where you think the roaches are coming from, like nice dark places for them to look for food and water. 
-The sweet sugary smell attracts roaches, so they eat the powder mixture. Once they take a drink of water, it reacts with the baking soda, and, well, let’s just say the roaches get a bad case of bubble guts.
-Cut a sizable strip of duct tape off the roll, maybe about the length of your forearm. Put the strip sticky-side-up, and fold down each end so that it’s easy to pick up and dispose of later on. You’ll also need a bait.
-The cockroaches will climb in to go after the bait, but they won’t be able to climb back up the slippery surface to escape.
-Roaches are drawn to the smell of coffee too, so they’ll climb in after the grounds but won’t be able to get out since they’re not the greatest of swimmers.
-If you try any of these natural remedies over time but it doesn’t seem to make a difference, then it’s probably high-time to call a professional!

"28 ECO-FRIENDLY HACKS || ZERO WASTE, REUSE, AND RECYCLE IDEAS","RECYCLING HACKS AND ZERO WASTE TIPS THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE

We all have a bunch of things sitting around in our homes without any use for them. So, in this video, I’m sharing with you some cool hacks that will help you recycle and repurpose old stuff into new ones. 
Don’t throw away your plastic toothbrushes, you can recycle them into anything you can think of. For example, remove the bristles, melt the plastic slightly into some hot water and turn them into cute bracelets. 
If you have wooden toothbrushes, you can turn them as markers/labels for your plants and place them in soil. 
You can repurpose plastic bottles into an automatic plant watering tool. 
Don’t use plastic straws and forks. You can take a sushi maker, run an elastic tape over it, and then turn it into a utensil case when you go out for lunch. 
You can also make a DIY thermos lunchbox using a glass, some kitchen foil, and then a plastic bottle. 
I also show you how to recycle food scraps and turn them into fertilizer for your plants.

"The One-Year Mission: By the Numbers on This Week @NASA – February 26, 2016","The International Space Station’s historic one-year expedition has been a mission of numbers – one that could add up to huge benefits for future space exploration – including the Journey to Mars, as well as for life on Earth. In March 2015, 2 space explorers, NASA’s Mark Kelly and Russia’s Mikhail Kornienko, set out on an unprecedented odyssey to the 1-and-only laboratory in microgravity, to conduct a multitude of biomedical and psychological studies on how the human body reacts to long-duration spaceflight. Based on a scheduled March 1 return to Earth – the one-year crew’s 340 days in space will have seen -- almost 400 experiments conducted aboard the station, 5,440 orbits of the Earth, and Kelly and Kornienko will have traveled a total of about 143, 846, 525 miles – roughly the distance of a trip from Earth to Mars.

LA fires death toll rises as officials warn against looting and price hikes | BBC News,"At least 16 people have been killed and another 13 missing from the devastating Los Angeles fires, the LA Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed.
 
Eleven deaths are linked to the Eaton fire, and five to the Palisades fire, but officials expect those numbers to rise.
 
Firefighters are making an all-out assault to prevent the largest of the deadly wildfires from spreading into one of the city's most exclusive neighbourhoods.
 
Aerial crews have been bombarding the flaming hills with water and fire retardant to hold back the Palisades fire, which is now menacing Brentwood, home to the world-famous Getty Center art museum.

27 LIFE SITUATIONS THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO,"HILARIOUS SCENES FROM REAL LIFE

Everybody knows that life differs from movies and awkward moments follow us everywhere! We prepared a selection of scenes that shows the difference between expectation and reality. For example, we think that we look stunning in new leggings and crop top in a gym but in real life after 15 minutes of hard work you are totally wet and exhausted and look awful. But there is a positive side - you will have a perfect body :) One more failure is when you are waiting for guests and cook a perfect pie crust but you have accidentally forgotten about a pie. The result is that you have burnt pie crust. 
There are always two kinds of girls! The first type always looks glamorous and chic. She is well-groomed day and night, looks glamorous and prefers sexy dresses, high heels, and shorts. Moreover, she makes perfect photos and selfies on Facebook. The second type of girls prefers comfortable clothes and doesn’t like makeup. She makes funny photos and always has fun. Always remember that you should completely love yourself and accept yourself as you are.
Do you remember your first date? During the first date partners are very shy and sometimes behave very silly. When people start dating they try to look as good as possible. Boys properly prepare for dates, girls pretend that they eat only one apple a day. Girls are afraid that boyfriend will see them without makeup in the morning and shave legs every day. After a year, everything changes and we prepared a funny compilation that shows how the relationship changes through time.

TIMESTAMPS:
00:09 Expectations vs. Reality hilarious scenes
00:51 Expectation vs. Reality: high heels
02:20 Expectation vs. Reality: pajama party
03:48 Two types of girls
10:06 First date vs. long-term relationships

Why Subway Doors Don't Open When You Squeeze Through,"What will happen if you get stuck in a subway door?  It happened to me yesterday when I was once again being late for work. As always, I rushed down the stairs and burst into the subway station next to my home. The train was about to leave, and, as if in slow-mo, I saw its doors closing! I made a wild dash, expecting the doors to open up as I was squeezing through... 
 
Well, to cut a long story short, it didn't happen, and I got stuck. The doors just wouldn't open as they used to do before! Luckily, some kind fellow passengers rescued me from the door trap, and I arrived at work in time! But as soon as I finished all the urgent work, I made a coffee break and sat at my computer to google why my morning accident happened in the first place.

"Pakistani Street Food - GOAT FEET JACUZZI + Tour of Walled City of Lahore, Pakistan!","SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l
Huge thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjH

Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

This is Day 2 of our trip to Pakistan. In this video we went on a Pakistani street food tour of the Walled City of Lahore, one of the oldest and most fascinating areas of the city. The Walled City is a maze of ancient alley, street food, and markets that never seem to end. It’s one of the best places in Lahore to explore and go on a food tour.

Phajja Siri Paye - This restaurant is a must eat when you’re in Lahore, famous for serving a dish called paya - goat trotters stew. Their massive pan, which I believe never stops bubbling or cooking, is packed full of goat feet trotters that slow simmer until fall apart tender. It’s a deliciously thick and meaty Pakistani dish to start your morning.
Total price - 1,300 PKR ($9.70)

Haleem - During my time in Lahore, haleem was probably the most surprisingly delicious dish I encountered. I honestly didn’t think it was going to be much, but sprinkled with boiling desi ghee, and seasoned with spices and herbs, it was truly incredible - so good I had to have a plate re-full. He wouldn’t charge us, thank you!

Wazir Khan Mosque

Dahi bhalay - 100 PKR ($0.75) - Next on this street food tour of the Walled City of Lahore, we came across a stall selling dahi bhalay, yogurt marinated lentil puffs. It was delicious and refreshing.

Chole bhature - 30 PKR ($0.22) - Next to the dahi bhalay was chole bhature, a dish of stewed chickpeas, seasoned with onions and achar pickle.

Fruit chaat - One of the best Pakistani snacks of the day was the fruit chaat, a massive bowl of chopped fruit, seasoned with apricot chutney and pomegranate. A\gain, he wouldn’t charge us, thank you!

Dhaba restaurant - Finally to finish this food tour, for a late lunch we went to a local dhaba, a local street side restaurant, that served a mix of Pakistani food. It was here I came across the fastest roti maker I’ve ever seen and we ordered a mix of different curries to share. After a delicious meal, we ended with dude pathi, pure milk tea.
Total price - 850 PKR ($6.34)

Badshahi Mosque - After our late lunch, we headed over to Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque, two of the most significant and historical sites of Lahore.

It was an amazing day exploring and eating through Lahore, a city that’s packed culture, history, friendly people, and delicious food.

Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

How Good of God 

If some would’ve told me  
How good my life would get  
I would have called them crazy  
‘Cause I couldn’t see it yet  
From a story going nowhere  
To where I standing now  
I’m smiling ‘cause I know there’s only one way how  
 
How good  
How good  
How good of God  
My heart can’t help but sing  
How good  
How good  
How good of God  
To be so good to me  
 
My sins have been forgiven  
And my wrongs have been erased  
And I’ve learned what’s so amazing about amazing grace  
Yeah, this life I live is proof  
That every prayer I prayed was heard  
Lord, ain’t it just like you to give me more than I deserve  
 
How good  
How good  
How good of God  
My heart can’t help but sing
Oh, how good  
How good  
How good of God  
To be so good to me  
 
From the victories on the mountain  
To the heartbreak valley low  
I’ve always been surrounded by the arms that won’t let go  
 
They’ll carry me to Heaven  
When it’s time to leave this earth  
Lord, ain’t it just like you to give me more than I deserve  
 
How good  
How good  
How good of God  
My heart can’t help but sing 
Oh, how good  
How good  
How good of God  
To be so good to me  
 
How good  
How good  
How good of God  
My heart can’t help but sing  
Oh, how good  
How good  
How good of God  
To be so good to me  
 
Oh, how good  
How good  
How good of God  
To be so good to me

Germany shooting: Suspect posted videos online days before the attacks  - BBC News,"A suspected far-right extremist carried out the attacks on two shisha bars in western Germany, killing at least nine people, officials say.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs the attacker in the city of Hanau had acted out of racism.

Federal prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Some of those killed were believed to be of Turkish origin.

The 43-year-old suspect killed himself, police say. He was found dead at his home along with the body of his mother.

Local media have identified the suspect as Tobias R, a German citizen. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car.

Authorities are examining a video that appears to be from the suspect, posted online days before the attacks, in which he expresses right-wing conspiracy theories. Bild said he had also left a letter of confession.

The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.""

Amelia Moore - back to him (Live I Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023),"Amelia Moore - back to him - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

Pre-save all my upcoming music: https://ameliamoore.lnk.to/icryatwork

You leave home, you spread your wings, and in most cases, you start becoming the person you were meant to become. Growing up takes a minute, and new experiences beget fresh ideas. That’s what happened when Amelia Moore said goodbye to the Christian aura of her Georgia childhood and embraced a rush of new thoughts at her Nashville college. Big goals and big plans emerged, and the violin-playing One Direction fan with the musical theater tween years who’d been bullied for experimenting with left-of-center lifestyle choices bet the farm on her artistic side. She headed to LA to see if her musical ideas could float. Indeed they could, as last year’s “sweet and sour” proved. A performance-coach pal supported her aspirations, and this past spring Moore’s ‘teaching a robot to love’ EP impressed everyone who heard it, so we had her back to our Brooklyn studio to roar through “love me or leave me alone.” The 22-year-old’s authority with a mic matches the clever wisdom and emotional insight of the songs she writes. In June we wrote that this “homeschool to Hollywood” (her term) arc delivered a pop personality whose bold fashion choices, Insta flamboyance and daring music held many rewards. The woman whose social media handle is @ICryAtWork says her songs are therapy, “for sure,” and the EP is her “perspective on falling in love” for the first time. “Now that I have music, I feel absolute freedom to be whoever I want to be,” she has said. This road could lead anywhere…

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Mon Rovîa - Rust. (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Mon Rovîa - Rust. | Vevo DSCVR

Trust that it will be a long time before you find a more delicate singer-songwriter than Mon Rovîa. With each release of his EP series, ‘The Acts of Mon Rovîa,’ thousands and thousands of listeners have been whisked away by the folk bard’s tales of war, love, and forgiveness. Fans of Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes and Big Thief will be predisposed to the way plucked guitar and quiet vocals build fantastical worlds on tracks such as “Big Love Ahead” and “City On A Hill.” The young man’s personal story, however, adds overwhelming pathos to his artistry. Born in Liberia, Janjay Lowe was adopted by missionaries at the age of seven and moved to America while his country succumbed to civil war. His chosen moniker, in fact, is an iteration of Liberia’s seaside capital city, and a totem to his West African roots. So it makes all the sense in the world that he wants his own music to carve out space for deep reflection. “I hope that people can find that connection and safe space to dive into their feelings and be able to work through things that may have been buried,” he told us on the DSCVR set. With more than 500 thousand followers on both TikTok and Instagram, not to mention two million current monthly Spotify listeners, those hopes are being realized in a big way. Let these performances of “Rust.” and “To Watch The World Spin Without You” provide a moment of thankful meditation in your day.

Pip Millett - Running (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022,"Pip Millett - Running. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Magnificent stories result when triumph emerges from tragedy. Pip Millett’s life story, sadly, includes the heartbreaking loss of her father. As a kid, young Pip would help DJ her parents dinner parties, where 70s classics permeated the air. Marvin Gaye and Joni Mitchell stirred something in her soul more than any other artists. When Pip was 14, her dad passed. It was then that Pip realized “life was too short” to do anything other than double down on her passion. The next rising action in the narrative came when our hero found herself juggling university with the success of “Make Me Cry.” A COLORS performance of the debut track notched up the buzz a few decibles. After school, the lifelong Manchester-area native relocated to London. This year, that immersion in the city’s vibrant music scene has yielded Pip’s ‘Motion Sick’ EP,  a 5-track project that weaves her crystalline mid-register voice around grainy samples of soul deep cuts. “Running” is the eeriest of them, dredged in a sense of impending doom. Resolution never comes in “Running.” When our DSCVR camera stops spinning and settles on Pip’s face for her performance of it, a spell is already cast; Over the next three minutes, the bass line moves more than she does. Pip lets that voice of hers do all the work - reminding us that while her story is triumphant, her strength comes from the emotions she’s felt on the long journey to get here.

European Car Tuner GP! - Tuner Battle Week 2014 Ep. 2,"The field for the 2014 European Car Tuner GP, presented by Continental Tire, was stacked full of high horsepower and fast lap times. At Streets of Willow we saw lap times drop into the 1:23 range courtesy of Platte Forme AG and their 2015 M3. We also saw insane dyno numbers at Church Automotive go up into the 600WHP range by 034 Motorsport’s Audi A3 and a relatively low horsepower E36 M3 almost take the overall win. The competition was very close but there could only be one winner!

Hawaii Moves 3 Inches Closer to Alaska Every Year,"The world is changing and so are we. 😱 The movement of tectonic plates causes earthquakes, volcanos, and irreversible changes in geography. For example, Hawaii moves 3 inches closer to Alaska each year! Random facts like this one are perfect to impress your geography teacher and break the ice of any conversation. Just like the fact that bees can fly higher than Mount Everest and hurricanes can't rush across the equator. Are you ready for more cool facts?

HUGE DIY BOAT || 25 AWESOME RECYCLING CRAFTS YOU CAN MAKE FROM OLD STUFF,"Recycling ideas and incredible DIYs you can make with stuff you’re about to throw out

Recycling is one of the best things we can do about our environment. We all buy brand new stuff that we have no use for after a while, but instead of throwing them away, we can turn them into something else that will serve us well in our current situation. To inspire your next project, I’m showing you some easy-to-follow crafts and ideas you’ll adore.
Let’s start with the most challenging project – making a vast DIY boat using steel drums. Then, you need to connect some wood strips and a laundry rope string to keep everything together. After that, you’ll need a wooden floor, some light-weight DIY furniture, and you’re ready to float in the river. 
One of the easiest things to repurpose is plastic bottles. You can use them to decorate your home, or you can use them to fix stuff. For example, I show you how to make watering your plants easier with a tiny plastic bottle cutting, or an easy way to extend your faucet. 

Timestamps: 
0:10 – The great boat project (DIY boat from scratch) 
2:04 – Easy DIY furniture

37 EVERYDAY PROBLEMS EVERY GIRL CAN RELATE TO,"FUNNY EVERYDAY MOMENTS

This video is full of fun! You will find different compilations that describe our lives: a compilation of annoying situations every girl knows; funny food moments; funny cell phone situations and more!
Every girl has a bag and even if it’s very small, it will be difficult to find anything inside it. Ugh! You shaved your legs in the morning and the most annoying thing is that hair appear suddenly again in a most inappropriate moment! 
Sometimes you don’t want to share your favorite cake with anyone. We have a perfect way to solve this problem - just cut a small piece for your friend and eat the rest by yourself. If you borrow a chocolate bar from your friend without asking, leave the note “Sorry! Hunger made me do it!’’. This will be a funny way to excuse. Anyone hates to share the food especially when you can order anything in a restaurant. Girls, do you eat your boyfriend’s food?) 
Check out a selection of funny moments with phones! Do you have a friend who takes photos of every food he eats in the restaurant? It’s an annoying situation especially if you are really hungry and simply want to talk with your friend instead of helping with a photo session for Instagram. Low battery is a really scary situation especially if you are out shopping and need to call your friend to meet. Always check your battery or take a power bank with you. 
Long hair is so beautiful! Still, they can cause a lot of problems like if the hair gets caught by zipper it’s really painful and cause great damage to ends; hair gets caught under a backpack; be careful when you close car window.
Find more funny moments!

Robert Chelsea: 'My new life with a stranger's face' - BBC News,"Eight years ago, Robert Chelsea sustained third-degree burns on more than half of his body when his car was hit by a drunk driver. 

In 2019, he became the first ever African American recipient of a full-face transplant.

This is story of his recovery, a remarkable test of faith, identity and character.

Since the first partial face transplant was performed in 2005, there have been less than 50 worldwide. According to federal data, in 2015 17% of black patients awaiting an organ transplant received one, compared to 30% of white patients.

Crossing the border to go to school in the US - BBC News,"Ana Fernanda and Ana Luisa Bernal are 16-year-old twins and juniors in high school. Since kindergarten, they've crossed an international border every single day to go to school.

The girls live in Mexicali, Mexico, with their mother but, being born in the US, they're able to cross to get an education in English in Calexico, California.

Like many other transborder (or ""transfronterizo"" in Spanish) children studying in a different country, the twins embark on their daily journey very early in the morning.

This film is part of the BBC's Crossing Divides season.

"Working from home 'not proper work', former UK supermarket boss says | BBC News","Working from home is creating a generation who are ""not doing proper work"", the former boss of UK supermarket Asda has warned.
 
Lord Rose told BBC Panorama that home working was part of the UK economy's ""general decline"" and employees' productivity was suffering.
 
His comments come as some companies are calling time on remote working. Amazon, Boots and JP Morgan are just some of the businesses who now require their head office staff to be in every day.
 
However, work-from-home expert Prof Nicholas Bloom said that while fully remote work can be ""quite damaging"" to some workers' productivity, spending three days out of five in the office was as productive as fully office-based work overall.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Attacks and celebration as Lebanon PM resigns - BBC News,"Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri has announced his resignation after 13 days of protests over political corruption and economic turmoil.

His televised address came soon after violence broke out on the streets, when supporters of two Shia groups attacked protest camps and roadblocks in Beirut.

They set tents on fire and beat anti-government demonstrators. Some chanted in support of Nasrallah, the leader for Hezbollah - a powerful force in the coalition government - and the Shia political party Amal.

Riot police and troops responded with tear gas, and by the end of the day, anti-government protesters were back on the streets celebrating Mr Hariri's announcement.

Discover the multi-dimensionality of a traffic jam. We break down the hyperloop and the noisiness of drones. Could our Jetson’s dreams only be a fantasy?

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

25 EASY LIFE HACKS THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU,"EASY LIFE HACKS

I discovered a simple, foolproof way to clean real silver without the toxic polish, without the fumes and without the piles of used paper towels. My reaction to this discovery was equal parts elation and rage. It was magic to see, but infuriating, too. I’d wasted whole afternoons of my life slaving away at that kitchen table when I could have been doing this simple process instead. I’m now going to share this method with you!

To begin, you’ll need a plastic container large enough to fit the items you’re cleaning, some aluminum foil, boiling water, and a few tablespoons of baking soda.

Bring water to a boil (enough to completely submerge your piece of silver) and line your container with a piece of aluminum foil, shiny side up (it’s OK if you need to use several sheets overlapping in a larger container). Fill your container with boiling water and then add baking soda, roughly 2tbsp per 0.3 gallon of boiling water. Next, add the silver, making sure it touches the aluminum foil.

Immediately you’ll see a bit of bubbling and fizzing, and gradually you’ll see the tarnish being lifted from the silver, revealing the shiny lustre underneath. After a few minutes, remove the silver (carefully – it’ll be hot) and remove any lingering tarnish by drying it with a soft cloth. If your piece is badly tarnished, you may need to repeat the process a few times.

The magic behind this hands-free silver polish is the way that the tarnish coating on the silver reacts with aluminum. Sulfur atoms, which adhere to the silver to create silver sulfide – that dark, tarnished look – are carried by the solution and transfer to the aluminum, forming aluminum sulfide and leaving your silver sparkling. Recycle the aluminum foil and you’ve got a waste-free way to polish your silver.

Eco-friendly methods are their best when they’re like these two tricks: quick, easy, and effective. I’ve never been a very good martyr (just ask my parents, who had to listen to me moan and whine about the silver-polishing) so while my motivation for taking a DIY approach to laundry detergent, cleaning, or personal care products is ultimately about mitigating my impact on the environment (doing so virtually eliminates packaging, drastically reduces waste, and uses non-toxic ingredients) it also just has to work!  : )

"Julian Assange freed in US plea deal, Wikileaks says | BBC News","After a years-long legal saga, Wikileaks says that founder Julian Assange has left the UK after reaching a deal with US authorities that will see him plead guilty to criminal charges and go free.

Assange, 52, was charged with conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.

For years, the US has argued that the Wikileaks files - which disclosed information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars - endangered lives.

Assange spent the last five years in a British prison, from where he was fighting extradition to the US.

But he soon gets bored as he waits in a hide for the rare bird to appear. Instead, he goes home and paints a picture of the bird, cuts it out and sticks it high up a tree in the back garden. Soon he is besieged by excited twitchers who think it really is the rare bird. They are all keen to get a snap and they’re willing to pay good money for a peek.

Trigonometry on Khan Academy: Big, fancy word, right? Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (""trig"" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question. Maybe you'll learn the answer from us in these tutorials!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.

25 TOTALLY COOL DIY PHONE CASES,"How to make your own brilliant phone cases from scratch

All smartphones look the same nowadays. It’s just a black screen and then a grey, gold or any other metallic color. Not only do phone cases protect them, but they also give them a unique look. So, in this video, I show you how to make your own adorable phone case from scratch. 
I show you how to make your own distress egg phone case. Take a plain phone case and then draw a circle with some white hot-glue on it. Then, take a balloon, cut it in half and fill it up with slime. Stick it on the case and voila. 
You can also use a pair of old jeans and make your own adorable phone case with a back pocket on it and some brown felt-it fabric around the camera lens. That will look like your case is wearing a belt. 
Another brilliant DIY phone case you can try is to take a plain phone case and then paint it with some blue nail polish. Then add some white black and purple and using a sponge daub it in. Before it dries, add some glitter stars on it and voila. A cute phone case that resembles space.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

War on hogs: Fight against 500k feral pigs in Louisiana,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
Subscribe to BBC News HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog 
Wild pigs are running amok across large parts of the US, causing an estimated $1.5 billion in damage each year. In Louisiana alone more than 500,000 of the feral hogs are thought to be on the loose. 
The animals - which can weigh up to 400lbs - reproduce quickly, have no natural predators and adapt to survive in any environment. As well as the damage they cause to agricultural land, the wild hogs pose a public health risk because they can be riddled with disease. Benjamin Zand from BBC Pop Up talked to farmers, trappers and scientists in Louisiana about the most effective - and humane - way to control the feral pig population.

LYRICS:
Can’t escape disappointment
Can’t avoid the delay
But I don’t have to make feeling down and defeated the place that I stay
Gonna rise to the moment
Gonna speak to the waves
Gonna push back the doubt that keeps dragging me down when I can’t find the way 

Don’t need to see it (eyes on You) 
To believe it (for my breakthrough)
Before You even move or make a way

I will stand in faith (eyes on You)
Walk by faith (for my breakthrough)
Live by faith (before You move)
I believe, I believe, I believe
Stand in faith (eyes on You)
See by faith (for my breakthrough)
Receive by faith (before You move)
I believe, I believe, I believe

It’s a season for healing
It’s a season for change
To see miracles happen that no one can fathom as heaven invades
It’s more than a feeling
And it’s anchored in praise
And when it’s the darkest it reaches the farthest and opens the way

This is how blind men get their sight
This is how dead men start to rise
This is how small things multiply
Nothing’s impossible
Nothing’s impossible
This is where oceans have to part
This is where light cuts through the dark
This is where I see who You are
Nothing’s impossible
Nothing’s impossible

Stir my faith
Stir my faith

Much-Needed Care for Sexual Violence Survivors in Nairobi,"At its clinic in Nairobi, Kenya, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) offers victims of sexual violence psychological and medical care, social support, and legal advice. 

The assistance is provided in one single center in the heart of Mathare, a slum area in Kenya’s capital city. The MSF staff’s priority is to provide a caring, safe and confidential environment for people who have been subjected to this kind of trauma, however long ago it happened. However, victims need to get medical care within 72 hours to effectively combat the risk of HIV. So, MSF teams have reached out to communities living near the clinic, to combat the stigma associated with sexual violence, and to let them know that care is available. 

They also work closely with other local groups—starting with the police—to ensure that victims of sexual violence are referred to the clinic as quickly as possible. A helpline and an ambulance service facilitate access to the clinic for people without any means of transport, especially at night.

Brexit: Theresa May gives Downing Street statement - BBC News,"The prime minster has called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"" and ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward for Brexit.

Theresa May said she had met with the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, but was ""disappointed"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not chosen to take part in discussions.

Earlier, the prime minister won a vote of no confidence by 325 to 306, as rebel Tory MPs and the DUP backed her to stay in No 10.

But just 24 hours before, both groups ensured her Brexit plan was voted down in Parliament by an historic margin.

Why is there plastic in Arctic snow? - BBC News,"A team of German-Swiss researchers has found that microscopic particles of plastic are falling out of the sky with snow in the Arctic.
Researchers collected snow samples from the Svalbard islands using a low-tech method - a dessert spoon and a flask. They found more than 10,000 of them per litre of melted snow.
The BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin has been looking in to what causes it.

Phoebe Ryan - We Won't (dscvr Live),"We were thrilled when Phoebe Ryan joined the bill for our dscvr Live show at Brooklyn’s Knitting Factory in April. The “We Won’t” singer always impresses when she takes the stage, and she certainly captivated the room when she rolled through her set. The results are two enticing performances, “Dark Side” and “We Won’t,” that are sure to satisfy fans who weren’t there.

Phoebe’s story is a mix of talent and hard work. She studied at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University and headed to LA to ply her writing craft and launch her own career as an artist. Credits started to pile up quickly; she helped shape songs by everyone from Bea Miller to Britney Spears. In 2015 she made a mash-up of R. Kelly’s “Ignition” and Miguel’s “Do You.” She also dropped her ‘Mine’ EP. Critics took notice, and stars did, too: both Taylor Swift and Tove Lo recommended Ryan’s music to their fans. Last year she revealed her command of hooks with “Chronic.” Its video found the singer leading a high school band of nerds who switch up their fashion choice and take over a school dance. She’s also featured on The Chainsmokers’ track “All We Know.” Its video has clocked 37MM views on Vevo. 

Be on the lookout for more performances from our dscvr Live concert. Dagny and The Big Moon were also red hot that night.

PANTHA loves playing with rough edges and the unconventional. The 24-year-old’s music and lyrical DNA are permeated by contrasts and contradictions. Just as contradictory as PANTHA‘s sound is her path so far: Early on, the self-taught musician tries out different directions and soon realizes what she wants, as well as what she doesn‘t want. She drops out of her jazz studies in Cologne and follows her own rules.

"Ultimate Adventure 2019 Episode 3, Reaching the end of the Road in Alaska #UA2019","As it turns out, time travel is possible in Alaska as Ultimate Adventure discovered on Day 4 by following the meandering Copper River until the road ends at the historic Kennecott Mine. When the mine shut down in 1938 the workers simply walked away, leaving all the tools of their trade behind. Its remote location allowed the mine to remain undisturbed for decades, a living time capsule of an early Alaskan mine. After touring the historic site, Ultimate Adventure hit the road, peeling off the pavement at sunset and engaging 4x4 because the campsite flanking the Alaskan Pipeline wasn’t accessible without Low Range and big tires. UA2019 set up camp and cooked under the stars among blueberry bushes and wildlife track. #UltimateAdventure #UA2019 #Offroading",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FIOQTJsGO8

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

7 Air Travel Tips to Know Before Your Flight,"Many people who travel by airplanes don’t know about all of their peculiarities. These 7 amazing and simple tips will make you feel better and more comfortable during your flight. 

TIMESTAMPS
The seats by the window are colder 0:21
Avoid drinking coffee or tea 0:49
Tables and seat pockets are the dirtiest places on the plane 1:12
Morning is the best time for a flight 1:44
The service is better in the final rows 2:06
Don’t inflate your neck cushion to full volume 2:33
Always go with a special menu 2:49

SUMMARY
- The temperature outside the cabin can fall to as low as −140°F to −149°С, which cools down the temperature of the plane’s fuselage. You can feel this external cold above all in the seats by the windows, especially during summer when you wear light clothing. 
- Keep in mind: the drinking water used to prepare hot beverages onboard can contain malignant bacteria such as E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Specialists who have tested the water on various airlines have reached this conclusion on more than one occasion. 
- Pockets on the seat back in front of you are sometimes full of trash accumulated during flights. Yep, they aren’t cleaned as thoroughly as you would expect. When it comes to the tray tables, it’s even worse! 
- Later flights are usually delayed because of the ‘ripple’ effects of delays throughout the day. Moreover, if you have a fear of flying, specialists claim that a degree of turbulence is reduced in the morning. 
- If you sit in the first rows, you will be the first to leave the plane at the end of the flight as well as get a choice of meal. On the other hand, if you pick a seat closer to the back of the cabin, you’ll more attentive service from the cabin crew!
- When you take a blow-up pillow onto the plane, don’t forget about the laws of physics! If you fill it with air completely, it might burst due to the changes in pressure in the cabin! 
- Airlines offer a choice of different in-flight meals such as vegetarian, seafood, halal, kosher, and many others. Even if you have no particular preference, many travelers recommend going for one of the specialist meal choices.

Lyrics:
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you,
I love the things that you do

Are There Too Many Satellites? | Chuck Asks Moriba…,"Are there too many satellites? On this explainer, Chuck Nice asks space environmentalist, Moriba Jah, about how the effort to create global satellite internet, by both SpaceX and Blue Origin, impacts low Earth orbit.

What’s the issue with sending more satellites to space? Should organizations that send things into orbit be responsible for getting stuff out of orbit? We discuss how long objects are allowed to stay in orbit after they stop being functional, how to deorbit them, and how we can enforce space junk removal. Are satellites maneuverable? Do we need a space traffic controller?

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

[Verse 1]
I thought that you said you'd buy me flowers
So you had me waiting here for hours
Empty handed, took for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
I thought that you said you'd take me dancing
Nothing special, just a touch of romancing
I can't stand it, how you take for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
You can refuse, I shouldn't have to use

[Chorus]
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

[Verse 2]
I know that you think I'm going crazy
But I'm not gonna settle for anything short of amazing
Couple billion on the earth
Don't you think I deserve someone who puts me first?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
Beauty and lies, unsatisfied
All the things we do for your kind
You can refuse, but I shouldn't have to use

[Chorus]
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

[Bridge]
And I could bare my body and my bones, mmm
But that would only tear me from my throne, hmmm

[Chorus]
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

Syria frontline patrol: the rebel gunmen who now police the streets | BBC News,"A fortnight ago they were rebel gunmen fighting the Syrian state.   Now with President Assad gone,  the fighters of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) are Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.

HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries.   But it’s promised to uphold the rights of all Syrians.

BBC News has been on patrol with the rebels turned policemen in the province of Latakia, an Alawite stronghold where many people supported the former President. 

Jane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Quentin Sommerville and camera-journalist Darren Conway.

New coronavirus strain “may be more deadly” says Boris Johnson - BBC News,"Boris Johnson has said  there is evidence that the new variant of coronavirus spreading across the UK could be more deadly than the original strain. 

Government scientists suggested the strain may lead to 30% or 40% more deaths.   They said that for men in their 60s,  10 out of 1,000 would be expected to die from the original virus.   With the variant strain,  the number of deaths per 1,000 has risen to 13 or 14.

The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said there is a lot of uncertainty around the numbers but it is of concern. 

There is good news on the vaccination programme with a record number of doses administered in the past 24 hours. 

However Boris Johnson warned that the infection rate is still ""forbiddingly high"" and he said he can't consider lifting restrictions in England until it’s clear that the vaccination programme is working.  

 But there's one vital question that scientists can't yet answer.  Will people who have had the jab still be able to pass the virus on?

Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by health editor Hugh Pym, deputy political editor Vicki Young and science editor David Shukman.

LYRICS

No llores por un bobo
Si él te deja sola, yo te robo
Te llevo a un lugar escondido
Donde podremos estar solos (Solos)

No llores por un bobo
Si él te deja sola, yo te robo
Te llevo a un lugar escondido
Donde podremos estar solos (Solos, solos, solos)

La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
No llores, muñeca
Y vamos pa' la discoteca, mami
La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
Mami, no más lágrimas
Que amores en la calle siempre hay demás (Lego)

Es bobo lo sé, lo imaginé
Mi mente pensando cuándo la podré tener a usted
Ël es un b-o-b-o, yo sólo veo, veo
Cómo te pierdes el deseo

Deja que el sol hoy te despierte en mi cama
Y que la luna sepa que estás aquí
Sin hablar de amor ni de esas cosas raras
Tú eres libre, así que vuela, mami

Deja que el sol hoy te despierte en mi cama
Y que la luna sepa que estás aquí
Sin hablar de amor ni de esas cosas raras
Tú eres libre, así que vuela, mami

La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
No llores, muñeca
Y vamos pa' la discoteca, mami
La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
Mami, no más lágrimas
Que amores en la calle siempre hay demás

Bailando, así te quiero ver
Mi vida, olvídate de él
Mami, no más lágrimas
Que amores en la calle siempre hay demás

Bailando, así te quiero ver
Mi vida, olvídate de él
Mami, no más lágrimas
Que amores en la calle siempre hay demás

No llores por un bobo
Si él te deja sola, yo te robo
Te llevo a un lugar escondido
Donde podremos estar solos (Solos)

No llores por un bobo
Si él te deja sola, yo te robo
Te llevo a un lugar escondido
Donde podremos estar solos (Solos, solos, solos)

La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
No llores, muñeca
Y vamos pa' la discoteca, mami
La, la, la, la; la, la, la, la (Yeh-eh)
Mami, no más lágrimas
Que amores en la calle siempre hay demás

J Balvin, men (What up my ginzas?)
Sky, rompiendo
Mo-Mo-Mosty, Bull Nene (Infinity Music)

Deja que el sol hoy te despierte en mi cama
Y que la luna sepa que estás aquí
Sin hablar de amor ni de esas cosas raras
Tú eres libre, así que vuela, mami

Deja que el sol hoy te despierte en mi cama
Y que la luna sepa que estás aquí
Sin hablar de amor ni de esas cosas raras

'I had horrific symptoms after breast implants' - BBC News,"Women who have experienced chronic pain and extreme fatigue after breast enhancement surgery have told the Victoria Derbyshire Programme they were not warned about the possible side effects.
Breast implant illness (BII) doesn't have an official diagnosis, but some women who believe they have the condition say they returned to full health after having their implants removed.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) does not currently recognise breast implant illness, but surgeons, including from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), are now calling for more research.
Naomi Macarthur says that symptoms that had impacted on her life for four years, began to disappear days after her implants were removed.

Warning to tourists as sixth traveller dies in Laos from methanol poisoning | BBC News,"A young Australian woman has died, the sixth foreign tourist to lose their life in Laos in South East Asia, from suspected methanol poisoning. 

Holly Bowles was 19, on holiday with her best friend Bianca Jones, who's also died.  Simone White, a lawyer from Kent in the UK is also among the victims. Two other victims aged 19 and 20 were from Denmark, and an American man in his 50s has also died. 

They were in a town called Vang Vieng in Laos, that's popular among backpackers.  Some of those who fell ill have been taken to hospital in neighbouring Thailand.

29 AWESOME HACKS YOU NEED TO KNOW,"UNEXPECTED CRAFTS AND IDEAS YOU SHOULD TRY

In his video, I show you how you can take everyday items and try different uses with them. This is a great way to recycle old ice-trays, straws, and a bunch of other things. 
Fill an old ice-tray with toothpaste, freeze it and use the blocks to clean your hands and cutting board from bad smells when you’re cooking. 
I show you my secret recipe that will help you make bath bombs.  Mix some baking soda, with citric acid, coconut oil, essential oil, and food coloring. Then press everything together in an ice-tray and you have mini bath bombs. 
You can also make little color blocks for your kids to help them pass the time. Add some watercolor or gouache paint in an ice tray, fill it up with water and dilute it with a stirrer. Then, attach some of the stirrers or popsicle sticks, freeze the paint cubes and then use them to paint. 
I also show you an easy way to draw planets using cardboard cuttings. First, you apply some paint on them (2-3 colors) then you stamp them on a paper and finally, you take some white paint to paint rings around them and make them come to life. 
Watch until the end to see all my craft ideas and creative techniques.

More work needed to rule out Covid lab leak theory says WHO - BBC News,"The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says further investigation is needed to conclusively rule out a theory that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in China.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that although a laboratory leak is the least likely cause, more extensive research is needed.

The virus was first detected in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in late 2019.

The Chinese government has dismissed the allegations of a virus leak.

How to make sticky rice (Thai street food style),"Follow this recipe to learn how to make sticky rice the authentic Thai way. Get more details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2015/02/how-to-make-thai-sticky-rice/

In Thailand, sticky rice, known as khao neow (ข้าวเหนียว) is the staple in the northern and northeastern regions of the country. Many Thais that originate from sticky rice regions, eat sticky rice multiple times a day, for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even snack. For this sticky rice recipe, I’m going to be making it the same way they make it in Isaan and other parts of Thailand, and I’m going to be cooking it right on my Thai street food cart. 

Sticky rice is often eaten with salads and grilled meats, dishes like som tam (green papaya salad), laab (minced meat salad), and all sorts of grilled meats and fish. Along the streets of Thailand, nearly everywhere you look in Bangkok, you’ll find food vendors grilling up skewers of pork called moo ping, and they always (unless they run out) also have sticky rice. The combination is one of the ultimate snacks combinations of Thailand.

In parts of Thailand where sticky rice is the staple, it’s typically cooked in the morning for the entire household, and then transferred to what is called a kratib khao neow (กระติ๊บข้าวเหนียว), a basket that is specifically made to hold sticky rice - it’s just a cylinder bamboo basket with a lid, and it keeps the sticky rice moist without getting crusty throughout the day. When meal times roll around, all participating eaters grab a handful portion of sticky rice and proceed by taking a ball of sticky rice about the size of an olive, dipping it into the dressing of one of the side dishes at the table, and consuming.

How to make sticky rice:

It takes a little time and some thinking ahead to make sticky rice, because just like cooking beans, you have to soak the rice before you cook it. It’s best to actually soak your sticky rice overnight, and then cook it the next day, but if you don’t have that amount of time, of if you wake up one morning and all of a sudden decide you want to cook sticky rice, you should soak it for at least four to five hours. All you have to do is put the raw sticky rice is a bowl or tub, and submerge it in room temperature water, and allow it to sit. You don’t even need to rinse the rice, just let it sit and soak. After the rice has been soaked, it will become a little swollen and much softer, so that it won’t take too long to steam.

After soaking the rice, I then transferred it to a cone shaped basket used for steaming. The rice then needs to steam in a pot with a few inches of water at the bottom for 15 to 20 minutes, but usually it just takes 15 minutes for me - that is if I soak the rice overnight. If you soak the rice for less time, it may take a little longer to steam. To steam, make sure the rice is elevated above the boiling water, then cover it somehow so the steam remains within the rice.

After 15 minutes you can remove the lid, and check to see if the rice is fluffy and not crunchy at all. If it’s still a little crunchy, just put the lid back on the basket, or whatever steamer you’re using, and allow to steam for a few more minutes. 

For this Thai sticky rice recipe I used one kilo of raw rice, but you can really use however much you want, and the exact same directs and steps will still apply. If you soak your sticky rice overnight, then follow this recipe, you’ll have beautiful, hot and fluffy sticky rice every time… and it tastes amazing!

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don’t walk away
It’s in the palm of your hand now, baby
It’s a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

(Juicy J)
She’s a beast
I call her Karma
She’ll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‘Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She’s sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She’ll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don’t care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’ mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Robinson - Medicine (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Robinson - Medicine - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Sometimes, you just wanna hear a good ol' pop banger! Well, please meet young New Zealander Robinson and her huge anthem ""Nothing to Regret"", a track that’s taken the viral charts by storm. It’s a song filled with such infectious pop hooks, huge crescendos and sugary lyrics that no one can judge you for whacking it on repeat. The rise of Anna Robinson began from an early age, having learnt the guitar and piano via YouTube tutorials in her teens. A supportive music teacher soon spotted her gift and pushed her to take things further. This hard work, support and natural talent all points towards a superstar future for the 21-year-old. Add renowned writers for the likes of Rihanna and Ellie Goulding into the mix then it’s almost a guarantee. With live shows and a debut album in the works, we can't wait to join Robinson in bopping around the room to even more of her soon-to-be hits.

Could giant sewage pipes solve India's housing crisis? - BBC News,"A 23-year-old woman from India has designed micro homes to solve the developing world’s housing crisis – using sewage pipes.

Perala Mansa, a civil engineer from Telangana state, designs ""O-Pods"" that can be moved between places and only take 15 days to build.

Since building her first model house in 2021, her firm claims to have around 500 orders from hotels and the real estate sector across India.

“Everyone asked me the same question. ‘You are a woman and if you fail in this project, who will be the guarantor for us?’” she said.

Why the Earth's Core Is Hotter Than the Sun,"We’ve managed to go hundreds of thousands of miles into space, but when it comes to the earth, we’ve barely scratched the surface. Our planet’s core is a magnificent mystery filled with secrets. It’s time to figure them out.

The Earth’s inner core is an extra hot solid ball that has a radius just 30% smaller than the Moon. Scientists figured out that most of the Earth’s mass is located towards the center of our planet.  The temperature of the inner core is about 9800°F. While the melting point of pure iron is about 2,800°F, at the core, its melting point is around 11,000° F.

Why is the earth still boiling? 5:50
A 2015 study from Durham University 6:53

#earthcore #earthfacts #brightside

SUMMARY:
-It’s estimated that the Earth’s mass is 5.6 sextillion tons. More than 80% of the core consists of one of the ten most common elements in our galaxy: iron.
-In 2013, Wendy Mao and her team from Stanford discovered a possible solution for how this happened. During their experiment, molten iron slowly squeezed through the silicate rocks, and they had their answer. It took millions of years for the iron to reach the center, so it happened at a snail’s pace.
-During an earthquake, shockwaves are spread through the planet. Seismologists study these vibrations and try to read the reflections on the other side. As science progressed, it turned out that picky “S-WAVES” could only go through solid material, and not liquid. So something molten was present in the center of the Earth that was preventing the vibrations from going through.
-The temperature of the inner core is about 9800°F. While the melting point of pure iron is about 2,800°F, at the core, its melting point is around 11,000° F. The fluctuation in those temperatures comes from factoring in the extreme pressure the iron is exposed to at the core. 
-The reason it remains solid is because of the slow cooling of the outer core and its compression. The inner core spins faster than the Earth. That’s caused by the thermal activity inside our planet which creates the magnetosphere.
-The first reason the Earth is still boiling is that the core has remained hot from the time our planet was formed – roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Secondly, it generates heat from the friction of the dense materials as they move. And the last reason it’s so hot is from the decay of radioactive elements.
-A 2015 study from Durham University claimed that 90% of the Earth’s sulfur is in the core. When the impact happened, the Earth’s mantle melted, and some sulfur-rich liquid squeezed through the ruins and reformed it. Some of it was probably lost in space, but the rest sunk to the core.

LYRICS

You got those eyes (that) stare into my soul
You get that smile when I’m giving you my all
You’re the brighter side of things, you’re the lighter side of life
And all the joy that you bring is why I need you in my life

But can I call you home?
You’ll be mine and I’ll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
In my mind I call you home

The only thing I ever knew is that I’ll never know
I’ve had my time in the sun and now I gotta go
You’re the brighter side of things you’re the lighter side of life
And all the joy that you bring is why I need you in my life

But can I call you home?
You’ll be mine and I’ll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home

In my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind

But can I call you home?
You’ll be mine and I’ll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home

And now can I call you home?
You’ll be mine and I’ll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home

In my mind I call you home 
In my mind I call you home

Fear of war between Israel and Hezbollah after fatal Golan Heights air strike | BBC News,"Hezbollah has denied any involvement in an air strike which killed 12 in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

Children were among the fatalities when a rocket hit a football pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams.

But Israel has blamed the Lebanese militant group for the attack, and now many fear an all-out war in the middle east.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N-aDEgzKwA

Lyrics

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Home, home
Home, home

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Home, home
Home, home

Why Mercury Goes Into Retrograde,"What is Mercury in Retrograde? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice break down what it means for a planet to be “in retrograde” and whether astrology has any impact on our lives. 

What did pre-scientific people think of Mercury in retrograde? We explore the rotation of planets around the sun and how often planets go retrograde. Does every planet go into retrograde from our point of view? Could we someday watch Earth go into retrograde from a colony on Mars?

Kashmir dispute: 'We've been pushed back into medieval times' - BBC News,"Indian-administered Kashmir is still in lockdown, following India's controversial decision to remove its special status.

India and Pakistan both claim the Himalayan region of Kashmir in full, but each nation only controls a part of it.

Young Kashmiris say they feel betrayed by India's move and that now their futures look bleak.

She Claimed to Be a Titanic Survivor But Nobody Believed Her,"We’ve heard the miraculous accounts from survivors of Titanic, painting a vivid picture of that harrowing night. They’ve all given us their unique personal experiences - except for one. Her name was Berthe Antonine Mayne, and when she told people about her life-changing cruise on the unsinkable ship; nobody believed her. 

Her story was discovered more than 50 years later when her nephew found a box in her closet with several clippings, photographs, and letters. So, why did everybody doubt her tale? Well, there’s a reasonable explanation. Oh, btw, this story isn't about the sinking of the Titanic only but also about big love...

#titanic #titanicsecrets #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Mayne was born in Brussels on the 21st of July, 1887. She became a cabaret singer in Brussels under the stage name Bella Vielly. She was very talented.
- In the winter months of 1911, she met the love of her life. His name was Quigg Baxter, and he was a professional hockey player from Montreal, Canada. 
- One night, Baxter was vacationing in Brussels with his mother and sister. The moment Mayne walked on stage, and their eyes met, she knew he was the one. It was love at first sight. 
- Baxter was going to return to Canada with her on the Titanic in April of 1912; and that meant that his and Mayne’s relationship would have to come to end. The thought devastated him.
- He refused to leave Europe until the love of his life went with him. 
- He secretly booked another cabin for her: number C-90, which was located right below his room. In order to make sure that nobody knew about it, he changed her name to “Mrs. De Villiers”. 
- On the night of the accident, Baxter was sitting in his room with his sister, when suddenly they felt the crash, and the ship stopped. 
- His family hadn’t even known that she was on-board the Titanic, or that they were a couple to begin with. So, as soon as they got to the lifeboat, he re-introduced them. 
- Baxter waved at his family as they were lowered to the ocean at 1:10 am. There were only 29 people on board, and things were tense among them. 
- When they were taken to New York, they searched excessively for Baxter, but he was never found. His love and his family were devasted. 
- Mayne moved back to Europe and continued being a cabaret singer. This time it was in Paris.  
- She never got married or had any children. When she retired, she moved to a country house in the suburbs of Brussels.
- Mayne recounted how she was on-board the Titanic with a Canadian millionaire, but that story seemed way too far-fetched to be the truth. 
- After she passed away, her nephew went to her house and went through a few of her things. Before long, he discovered a mysterious shoebox in the closet. Inside was all the evidence to back up her unbelievable story.

Carlin Isles:  From homelessness to Rio - BBC News,"The USA's Carlin Isles was the top try scorer at the 2016 Olympic Games in the rugby seven's tournament. He was homeless before the age of six, his mother went to prison and he and his twin sister were put into foster care.  They were adopted aged eight and Isles started playing sports and running track.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Lebanon’s geography means it’s blessed with water but in the capital Beirut and its surroundings areas, more than 1.5 million people suffer from serious water shortages.

The government says it's doing all it can to improve water supplies but many people think it's not enough.

What If You Dig a Tunnel Under the Ocean?,"It takes approximately 8 hours and 15 minutes to get from London to New York by plane. If you choose to take a trip by ship, you'll spend almost a week in the ocean. But what about traveling a distance of 3,460 miles within an hour? Yup, a new type of transportation might appear in the world! 

Futuristically fast trains that resemble transport capsules from sci-fi movies are supposed to move through low-pressure tunnels. Researchers from the USA and China are already working on this project. Some specialist are as optimistic as to predict the appearance of this new revolutionary type of transport in the next 10 years!

TIMESTAMPS: 
The idea of “vacuum trains” 1:33
How does it work theoretically 2:21
What could make this type of transportation even faster 3:41
How to create such a construction 4:26
Can you drill the ocean floor? 4:42
Or can you leave the tunnel floating in the water? 6:14
Or could the tunnel lie on the ocean floor? 7:21
How much could the tunnel cost? 8:00

#moderntransportation #futureinventions #futuretechnology

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- American engineer Robert Goddard created several prototypes of a vacuum train that could connect the biggest American cities. Since then, a lot of designers have been working on the implementation of this idea.
- According to Ernst G. Frankel, shipping expert and professor emeritus from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, such a vacuum tube may give us the advantage of high speeds.
- There must be huge pumps, approximately 30 miles apart, to help keep a near vacuum in the tunnel. The air leak would happen through the end stations.
- However, there's something that could make this type of transportation even faster: the combination of the vacuum train with another technology, for example, magnetic levitation.
- If you went for the first option, you’d have to drill the rock of the ocean floor. But the Atlantic Ocean is incredibly deep, and its average depth reaches 12,000 ft. You can imagine how huge the water pressure is at the bottom!
- The other way to build the tunnel is to leave it floating in the water. On the positive side, you wouldn't have to dig through thousands of miles of hard rock. Thus, this would take much less time.
- There is an option of building a tunnel that would lie on the ocean floor. But this alternative doesn't eliminate all the problems of the tunnel construction such as huge water pressure, big depths, and the difference of these depths.
- Whatever method of tunnel construction we choose, the biggest problem remains unsolved: the incredible cost of the tunnel. The total sum needed to finish the construction of the tunnel could hit $12 trillion!

If your beautiful silver ring starts to get rusty just pour some Cola into a pan. Let it boil. Then put your ring into the boiling water and rest there for a couple of minutes.

2016 Lamborghini Aventador SV LP750-4: Is it Legal to Have This Much Fun? - Ignition Ep. 147,"There have been several big, mid-engined, V-12 Lamborghinis over the years. Starting with the sinfully gorgeous Miura, through to the spaceship-looking, brand defining Countach, to the sinister Diablo, to the origamiish Murcielago, to the modern day Aventador, they’ve all been loud, sexy, attention-garnering beasts. But have they been any good to drive? Honestly? No, not especially. Not in the driver’s car sense of the word. Well friends, meet the latest Lambo Superveloce on this week’s episode of Ignition presented by Tire Rack (http://www.tirerack.com). Power is up, weight is down, and key handling bits are all new. Does the red monster live up to its name, which literally translates to “super fast?” Watch as Jonny Lieberman finds out!

Does Your Dog Really Watch TV?,"Dogs can totally watch TV! It's not like they're flipping channels, but they can see and respond to what's on the screen. Certain shows or videos designed with high-contrast colors and movement are more dog-friendly. It's not universal, though – not all dogs are couch potatoes. It's like a personal preference thing, just like some people are into reality shows while others are all about documentaries. So, if your dog's eyeing the TV, they might be more of a movie buff than you thought! 🐾📺

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Feeding 10 Billion By 2050: Creating a Sustainable and Healthy Food Future,"What does a sustainable and healthy future mean when it comes to food production, consumption and resulting environmental impacts? With nearly a billion people globally going hungry and nearly two billion eating the wrong food, the answer is pressing – especially as we look to a future that needs to sustainably feed “10 billion by 2050.” This Forum explored how to avert dire consequences for human and planetary health through best practices and new technologies. Key questions were how to amplify nutritious food production, prevent waste and secure supplies, while protecting our environment in the process. The discussion included the “planetary health diet” recently proposed by an international commission that emphasizes plant-based eating for better health and for minimal ecological impact.

This Forum event was presented jointly with NBC News Digital on March 22, 2019.

Spy In The Wild
The Spy Creatures discover that mischief is rife in nature, but perhaps there are still rules that govern animals' lives. Spy Macaque visits a monkey swimming pool where teenage tearaways attempt the high dive causing chaos for parents teaching babies to swim. Spy Tropicbird reveals how frigate birds ruthlessly steal fish from real tropicbirds. In Australia, a bowerbird decorates his courtship bower with blue treasures, and a smart imposter attempts a daylight robbery on his precious horde. Spy Bowerbird investigates the shenanigans complete with his own nest rigged with irresistible Jewelcams. In Antarctica, Spy Penguin keeps a beady eye on a crafty Adelie penguin as he uses a storm as cover to steal stones from other penguin nests. As the storm clears, skua birds arrive and steal the penguins' eggs, and Eggcam captures the most astonishing aerial view of a penguin colony ever seen. Among chimpanzees, an illicit affair creates outrage among the dominant males, and a similar misdemeanour in a meerkat colony results in some very rough justice. A spectacular war dance follows as neighbouring meerkat groups battle over territory. A gang of surf-loving dolphins get their teenage kicks from a poisonous but intoxicating pufferfish, and lemurs try out natural highs when they use millipedes as insecticides with some very dreamy side effects. Spy Wolf Cub watches as naughty wolf cubs are taught the hard rules of pack life, and Spy Egret joins forces with a state-of-the-art Dungcam to see how elephants discipline their misbehaving youngsters. In a spectacular finale, an impudent chimpanzee stages a challenge to the troop leader, resulting in a fight with weapons that hints at how human warfare may have begun.

"Scientists Found a New Natural Cycle, And It’s Truly Astonishing","Scientists have discovered a brand-new natural cycle that’s super surprising and unlike anything we’ve seen before. It turns out there’s a pattern in nature that affects ecosystems, climates, or even the way certain species behave, but we just didn’t notice it until now. This new cycle shows how different parts of the Earth are more connected than we thought, influencing each other in amazing ways. The findings could totally change how we understand things like weather patterns, animal migrations, or even plant growth. What’s exciting is that this discovery opens up so many new questions for scientists to explore. It’s a reminder that even today, nature still has secrets to reveal!

"Monkeypox found in three new countries, as scientists look for cause of outbreak - BBC News","Monkeypox cases have been identified in Israel, Switzerland and Austria, meaning the outbreak has now been found in 15 nations outside Africa.

However, the risk to the wider public is said to be low.

Anyone who has had contact with a monkeypox case is being advised to isolate for 21 days, according to official guidance in the UK and Austria.

The UK Health Security Agency has also warned that some groups could be vulnerable to severe illness from the virus, including pregnant women, immunosuppressed people, and children under 12.

No Rome - Talk Nice (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"No Rome - Talk Nice - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

In The 1975’s ‘Sincerity Is Scary’ video, Matty Healy leaves his apartment and immediately daps up a dog-walking, blue-haired neighbor in an orange jumpsuit. Rome Gomez, aka No Rome, is the guy with the leash, and the moment serves as a solid metaphor for the creative relationship that he shares with his famous pal. At this point, Rome’s career is nicely intertwined with that of the Brit rocker. After all, it was Healy who flew the Manilla native, music-school dropout and blossoming indie pop hero to London to clock a little career ascendance. After impressive vids for “Seventeen” and “Saint Laurent,” Rome formally united with the ‘75 on last year’s “Narcissist.” It says a lot about his potential that we chose him for Artists to Watch 2020, because this past year was already quite fruitful for the buttery-voiced fashionista with the R&B tones. He spanned the globe on tour with Team Healy, including a homecoming gig in the Philippines, and still found time to hit our DSCVR studios for a romp through “Pink” and “Cashmoney.” According to a recent Beats1 interview, Rome also worked with the frontman, and drummer George Daniel, on the forthcoming ‘75 record. At the end of November, Rome heads out on a 20-show UK run with fellow Dirty Hit roster-mates Beabadoobee and Oscar Lang. Yes, his name is getting out there. Somehow, in between the flurry of activity, we were able to get him back in the DSCVR studio, where he debuted two irresistible newbies: “Talk Nice” and “Trust 3000.” Get to know this indie darling before everyone else does.

What If You Had to Live Underwater for Years,"How long can you hold your breath underwater? Aleix Segura Vendrell, a professional free diver from Spain, managed to hold his breath for 24 minutes and 4 seconds. I know, it's hard to wrap your mind around. But it got me wondering: could people live underwater? 

Come to think of it, living underwater would have loads of advantages. For example, hurricanes and tsunamis wouldn't be dangerous anymore: in a deep-water house, you wouldn't even feel the raging waves. You wouldn't need a swimming pool if you decided to throw a pool party. But if people had to spend their lives in the water, they’d have to evolve and turn into a completely different species...

What If You Dig a Tunnel Under the Ocean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PZ8KwlxhIk&

TIMESTAMPS:
It's too cold, it's too dark 1:25
Underwater communication 2:12
Human skin breaks down in the water 3:10
Can underwater cities exist? 4:29
What would we eat? 6:27
Btw, this technology does exist! (Wait, what?!) 7:50

#underwater #whatif #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Your muscles are built to help you move on land. That's why, if you spent all your time underwater, they would atrophy, and you’d become incredibly weak.
- Your limbs aren't the most effective implements when it comes to swimming. That's why you’d also have to grow fins.
- At a depth of 650 ft, it would already be too dark for you to see anything. And don't forget about the water pressure!
- Your ears and eyes have been developing for thousands of years to work in the air. That's why underwater communication would be a huge challenge.
- Scientists still don't understand the reasons completely, but when you spend too much time in the water, your skin starts to break down.
- However, scientists don't deny that one day, genetics might go as far as to modify humans so that they’re able to live underwater!
- Underwater cities and colonies wouldn't be built deeper than 1,000 feet. Any deeper than that and the structures, along with their inhabitants, would collapse under the incredible pressure.
- Plus, people wouldn’t only have to solve the problem of oxygen supply, but also figure out how to maintain the correct ratio of various air components.
- One of the main problems in underwater colonies would be an infection. If someone got sick in such an enclosed space, the virus would spread very fast.
- But at least underwater colonies wouldn't suffer from a lack of food! Living on the ocean floor, you’d get access to all the seafood you can find there (and that's a lot!).
- People could set up farms raising shrimp and fish, which are perfect sources of protein.
- It would be possible to grow special plants for making ecologically friendly fuel, such as biodiesel, more cheaply.     
- The technology to make underwater colonies possible already exists! These colonies can easily support up to 100 people, and scientists are working on ways to make this number bigger. 
- The main problems so far are creating working evacuation routes, figuring out how to get enough air, and how to make the environment humid enough.

Oil spill as barge sinks in Galapagos Islands - BBC News,"Ecuador was fighting to contain the environmental impact of a fuel spill in the Galapagos Islands after a flatboat carrying 600 gallons of diesel fuel sank.

The Orca barge tipped over after a crane collapsed while it was loading a container onto it.

Ecuador's Integrated Security Service added, ""the barge crew jumped into the sea to safeguard their lives"".

The Unesco World Heritage Site is home to one of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet and the Galapagos National Park said military personnel and environmentalists were ""putting up containment barriers and absorbent cloths to reduce the environmental risk"".

Assam NRC: People queue to check they are on list - BBC News,"People have been queuing across the Indian state of Assam to check if their name is on the National Register of Citizens.

India has published the final version of a list which effectively strips about 1.9 million people in the north-eastern state of their citizenship.

Families have been required to provide documentation to show their lineage, with those who cannot prove their citizenship deemed illegal foreigners.

India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

The BBC's South Asia correspondent Rajini Vaidyanathan has been to the village of Katajhar to meet some of the people who say they are at risk.

Shaybo - Anger (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2021,"Shaybo - Anger. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Stand back a bit when Shaybo’s going off. With a mic in her hand, the UK sensation spits with a power that’s a little daunting - and that’s a good thing. Ferociousness is one of the attributes that has earned the South London rapper a recent groundswell of fans. Blistering tracks such as “Dobale,” “Anger” and “Daily Duppy” command your attention instantly. And Shaybo’s flow flies around those beats with a swooping authority. The self-proclaimed Queen of the South has a novel emergence story. Her Nigerian family moved to London when she was six. She started rapping in her early teens, when Nicki Minaj’s music provided an inspirational perspective that male MCs couldn’t. She learned to rap by battling all comers in the school yard. The focus that marks her current work is evident “Female Eruption,” which she made at 13, surrounded by a lady squad and riding a dancehall groove. She’s long deemed herself a tomboy from the hood, whose short fuse - whether with romance or societal woes - often got her in trouble. When her parents asked her to hit uni before carrying on with music, she studied social work, assisting survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire. But one way to push an agenda of equality is to inspire women to use their voices, and when music grabbed her in her third year, she left school and got back in the game. “I don’t want to glamorize confrontation or fighting,” she’s said, “but I do want to glamorize women sticking up for themselves.” Now tastemakers are shouting her out, Lily Allen and Katy B are texting and her ‘Queen of the South’ EP is almost here. Shaped by Ghanian producer Guiltybeatz, it shows Shaybo in a wider lens, tapping the brakes on drill beats, and stressing versatility. But don’t worry, the fierceness hasn’t vanished. The rat-a-tat cadence driving her ATW performances of “Daily Duppy” and “Dobale” is intense.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

30 CLAY AND CONCRETE CRAFTS YOU NEED TO KNOW,"AMAZING THINGS YOU CAN MAKE WITH CEMENT

To help you get creative and give some color to your stuff around you, I demonstrate some tips and tutorials using both clay, concrete, and a bunch of other tools. 
For starters, take an ice-cream cone, fill it with cement, and then use it to organize your jewelry. 
Another great DIY hack is to add cement in a Ziplock bag, then pour it in an ice tray, add some paper clips on the top, and then use them as little paper organizers for your desk. 
 You can also make amazing furniture using cement. Or, if you have old books, recycle them into a stand for your lamp by soaking them into cement. 
You can also use an old candy container as a mold for your cement. After it dries, apply some gold acrylic paint to it to give it some color and then attach a ring to it to make beautiful jewelry. 
Watch until the end to see how to make polymer clay jewelry and other amazing DIY crafts for beginners.

"If You Ever Visit Japan, Don't Eat This Fish","We humans love the excitement of taking a risk or trying out our good luck. Buying a lottery ticket, doing extreme sports, or riding roller-coasters can do the trick. However, sometimes an action as simple as having a meal can cause an adrenaline rush. Our health and even lives may depend on the chef's qualifications, storage conditions, or even the after-life reflexes of the meal.

For example, have you ever heard of pufferfish? It's a Japanese delicacy and something akin to Russian roulette in the world of food. Its highly poisonous flesh contains tetrodotoxin, which is 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide! It’s almost completely banned in the US. Let's find out more about it and some other dishes from all over the globe that can give you an adrenaline rush stronger than that from any roller-coaster and test your good luck better than all the lotteries in the world!

Valley - Last Birthday (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Valley - Last Birthday. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Like a pop music romcom, Valley's story begins with a chance meeting and some instant chemistry. During their high school years, Karah and Mickey worked together as a duo, and Rob and Alex were united as their own separate group. When a local studio accidentally booked the same session time for both acts, the foursome hit it off and decided to work as one. Since that fateful day, the members of Valley have grown into a deeply collaborative unit, sharing songwriting duties and dodging the assignment of formal roles. They helmed their 2016 debut, 'This Room Is White,' but have also worked with producers Andy Seltzer (Maggie Rogers) and Josh Gudwin (Dua Lipa). Mickey described the totally informal collab that yielded “Last Birthday” as “drinking wine, eating cookies and hanging” with the song's co-writer, Ashe. That track is part of our DSCVR session, which came out great. The band really reveals its full power about halfway through ""Like 1999,"" Karah’s background harmonies blending with Rob’s romantic requests as Alex and Mickey come in on bass and guitar. It’s the type of chemistry that was meant to be.

ArrDee - Oliver Twist (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2022,"ArrDee - Oliver Twist. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

It’s not every rapper that kicks off a career by paraphrasing Charles Dickens, but ArrDee helps explain a longstanding hip-hop goal when he opens his debut hit “Oliver Twist” with “I just wanted some more.” The 19-year-old Brighton native threads his rhymes with humor. Not in a silly sense, but in a way that blends the excitement of spitting with the power of wit. He isn’t known for being a “cheeky chappy” for nothing - the kid with the massive mic tat on his forearm has told interviewers that he likes to “make people laugh and show lyrical ability as well.” In his first few tracks, including “Jiggy (Whiz)” and “6am In Brighton,” he fulfills on both while describing the particulars of being “a seaside boy who sat in his ding dong rapping.” Party nights with his boy squad on England’s southern coast, the confidence that comes with a quick turn of success - ArrDee’s subjects are always close to hand. “I'm a star player like Messi/I'm in the party with ten jezzies/Can't roll yard much, getting stressy/Having it large like Kevin and Perry.” Dude’s made pals quick, too. The remix of Russ Millions and Tion Wayne’s “Body” was his first important intro to a UK audience, and he collabs with Digga D on “Wasted.” Check that “Oliver Twist” video and you’ll find a cameo from social media influencer Adeola Patronne, who ArrDee shouted out in his “Body” verse. Yes, our hero is going places. Have a little fun and jump in for the ride.

United Nations urges UK to crack down on racist hate speech | BBC News,"The United Nations has urged the UK to take action to curb racist hate speech, including by politicians, in a report published on Friday.

The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination said it was especially concerned by the persistence and in some cases ""sharp increase"" of hate crimes and hate speech in the UK.

Concerns included racist hate speech published by mainstream media, on social media, and spread by politicians and public figures.

The UN said it was ""particularly concerned"" about racist acts and violence by ""far-right and white supremacist"" groups.

Much of the evidence considered by the committee would have been collected before the general election and the recent riots across England and Northern Ireland fuelled by misinformation and anti-immigrant sentiment.

Erdogan vows to complete offensive in Syria - BBC News,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to press on with an offensive in Syria until his mission to create a ""safe zone"" is complete.

Turkish forces launched an operation to clear Kurdish fighters from northern Syria last week, after US troops allied to them pulled out of the region.

The Turkish government views one of the main militias as a terrorist group.

Mr Erdogan has also said he will snub direct talks with the US vice-president when he arrives in Turkey.

The Turkish president said that Mike Pence and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would only speak to their counterparts and not him directly on Thursday.

""When Trump comes here, I'll talk to him,"" he said.

11 Secrets Advertisers Don’t Want You to Know,"Going to a cafe or store, we usually have an idea of what we’re going to buy there. However, we often make purchases on a whim that we can’t later explain even to ourselves. Have you ever been in a situation like this? Have you ever spent much more than you planned?

If so, watch these ingenious tricks advertisers use in hope to get all of your money at once. The last trick is totally unfair – we think it should be prohibited forever!

TIMESTAMPS
They offer a trendy product 0:42
They use psychological tricks in the menu 1:10
They use a comparison 2:25
They create a legend 2:50
They make use of our laziness 3:09
They know human psychology 3:28
They sell twice as much 4:23
They add authority 4:51
They raise the price for similar goods 5:20
They misrepresent goods 5:48
They make things serve for less time 6:26

SUMMARY
- if you slightly changed the recipe, update their looks, and turn them into fancy muffins or cupcakes, the humble cake would gain a second wind.
- Price tricks. People have trouble parting with their money, and restaurants know that. That’s why they often don’t indicate the currency.
- Marketologists use this trick: they add a similar product with a higher price so that the initial one will seem cheap enough by comparison, and its sales will go up again.
- One more nice move is to create a legend that will follow the product, and it doesn’t matter if it even makes sense. Milky Way, for example, made a TV commercial in the early ’90s, showing the candy bar floating in a glass of milk.
- Merchandisers know we’re often too lazy to open up the plastic package and fetch just one bottle. 
- We tend to associate a red price tag with a reduced cost, even though it’s not always the case: the price may remain the same, and the tag is just a bright piece of paper.
- 
Have you ever wondered why people in chewing gum ads always take two pieces at a time? That’s a trick to make you think it’s the correct way to chew it. Meanwhile, you’ll use twice as many pieces during the same period of time, and manufacturers sell more. 
- Someone came up with a genius idea to paint the devices’ handles the color of potato peel. People started accidentally throwing away the peelers with the skins, and sales went up again.
- Manufacturers always try to add some ""weight"" to their products. For instance, they inform you that there’s exotic flower essence contained in the shampoo.
- It turns out that goods for women and girls cost 7% more than similar products for men and boys, despite the only difference being their color. 
- 
Marketing experts often manipulate terms when writing descriptions for food products. For example, the famous potato chips Pringles are not really potato chips, with actual potato content being only 42%, which also explains their unnaturally perfect shape.

26 Clever Camping Tricks And Ideas || Must-Know Travel Hacks,"Genius camping and traveling hacks every adventurer should know

Do you have anything planned for the summer? August is the month to relax. You can go for a swim, maybe go camping and explore nature with your friends. If you haven’t decided what you’re doing yet, I show you some cool camping hacks and ideas that will save you both time, effort, and money.
For starters, I show you how to create an outdoor shower. You can also place a shower curtain around it for some privacy.
Splinters and camping go hand in hand. So, it’s a good idea to carry some syringes with you to remove them without any effort.
Another problem you might come across while camping is rain. It might not rain where you are, but the soil can be damp for days. To help you avoid that, I show you how to use a rope and a thick bedsheet to make a sturdy suspended hammock where you can rest.
Food is vital in the wild, and you should become more creative when it comes to cooking. So, be careful not to throw away some of your trash, because you’ll need them. – For example, you can use an old soda can for cooking, or you might need to use a plastic bottle as a fish trap or a water filter.

Rina Sawayama - Cherry (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Rina Sawayama - ""Cherry,"" an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

It's been fun watching Rina Sawayama craft her career path these last few years. The singer, who was born in Japan, moved to the UK as a kid, and spent her university days studying politics at Cambridge, was part of a university hip-hop outfit that also featured Wolf Alice's Theo Ellis. But soon enough, the music-making bug bit her hard enough to venture on her own, and those who heard early efforts, like ""Sleeping in Waking,"" realized there was something valuable about her approach. 2015's ""Where Are U"" proved that the fun she had growing up with pop heroes like Britney and P!nk in her head could be spun her own way. The poise of a techno poem like ""Cyber Stockholm Syndrome"" was equally seductive, and the fact that the young artist also spent time modeling for some key brands helped expand her horizons. Last year's 'RINA' EP made it plain, and this summer's fashiontastic video for ""Ordinary Superstar"" underscored it: she has a great pop sensibility. Sawayama performed a couple of tracks for us at Britain's The Great Escape earlier this year, and we knew we wanted more. Her DSCVR performances of ""Take Me As I Am"" and ""Cherry,"" complete with a pair of dancers, are total fun.

Is social media pushing people away from birth control? - BBC News,"There's a growing trend of social media influencers pushing women towards natural birth control methods.

Funny Situations We All Faced,"Hilarious things that will make you relate in every aspect

Sometimes we grow through things that make us want to disappear – especially when we embarrass ourselves in front of a ton of people. And in this video, I show you some relatable things all of us experienced at least once to show you that you aren’t alone. 
For example, when you forget to close your backpack and you bend to tie your shoe-laces and all your stuff falls out. Or when you’re ding chorus and you start signing loudly without realizing. 
To help yourself fall asleep fast, blink your eyes really fast. 
If you’re a cat owner, then I got some cool solutions for your pet. If they keep jumping on the table you can add some aluminum foil on the surface, they don’t like the sound of it. 
You can use a hairbrush to remove your cat’s hair from a carpet.
Watch until the end to see some hilarious situations all people with neighbors can understand.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Armani White - NO MISTAKES. (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Armani White - NO MISTAKES. - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

The “it factor.” The “whole package.” Call it what you want, but when we had Armani White come through our Ctrl studio earlier this year, we were pretty blown away by the Philly dude’s potential. So much so that we insisted he return, this time to our Artists To Watch 2023 stage. If you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve still probably felt his viral track “BILLIE EILISH.” rattling your coop. Riding a sly rework of N.O.R.E.’s “Jewel” fastened by July Da Producer, it emphasizes the hop in hip-hop. Try to stay seated while it bumps. Impossible. White says Billie is a big inspiration, a fan since the “my boy” days, and an even bigger fan of her bold fashion choices. “I wanted to make something that pays homage to her creativity and playfulness while also displaying my very similar character,” he told us. Mission accomplished. Those plugged into the Philly rap scene likely know White’s 2019 project ‘Keep In Touch.’ His charismatic delivery and penchant for ambitious beat selections really came through on standout tracks “Onederful” and “Public School.” Think a little Brockhampton here, a smattering of Aminé there. Event though this was his second time performing his breakout hit for us, it still felt super fresh. A live drummer and more room to bounce around helps with that. Keep an eye out, there’s more to come.

We've all seen trouble from time to time
There is a mountain ahead
I've got no strength to climb, hey

I hope this journey won't take long
But won't you please
Have mercy
 
Everybody needs a helping hand

If that ain't what it's all about
Tell me what
What can I do
What can I do today
What can I do today

I'm talking 'bout the soul all alone
Needing the daily bread
Someplace to lay his head, yeah, hey
And I'm talking about the neighbor on your street
Won't you look him in the eye
Take time to speak
That's mercy, yeah
 
'Cause everybody needs a helping hand
Take a look at your fellow man
And tell me what can I do today (what can I do today)
'Cause everybody needs a helping out
If that ain't what it's all about
Tell me what

What can I do
 
Love one another
Sister and brother

Major breakthrough on nuclear fusion energy - BBC News,"European scientists say they have made a major breakthrough in their quest to develop practical nuclear fusion - the energy process that powers the stars.

The UK-based JET laboratory has smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen.

If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy.

The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds, more than double what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997.

The Fastest Thing Ever And 9 Other Rare Objects,"You most likely know the fastest animal in the world is a cheetah. But what about man-made objects? A supersonic jet? A space rocket? That’s a good guess. The champion in the super speed competition is Parker Solar Probe. It studies the Sun and flies at an incredible speed of 213,200 mph.

But that is not the greatest speed in the Universe. There is a piece of plasma that flew out of a black hole out there that moves in a spiral and forms a cone at a speed of nearly 6,000,000 mph! Fortunately, this incredible force flies far from us, in another galaxy 50 million light-years away.

SUMMARY:
-Air Force Hypersonic Rocket Sled is a special mechanism on rails with a rocket engine created to test rockets and other space objects moving at a speed of 6,600 mph.
-NASA X-43A (or Hyper-X) unmanned supersonic flying vehicle flies at a speed of 6,800 mph.
-Space shuttles ""Columbia"" and “Discovery” had to reach a speed of 17,500 mph to stay in the orbit.
-Apollo 10 mission report states its maximum speed at entry was 24,816 mph.
-Stardust space probe developed its maximum speed of 28,860 mph.
-NASA's ""New Horizons"" automatic interplanetary station during its mission has developed a maximum speed of 36,400 mph. NASA sent ""New Horizons"" to study Pluto.
-At a speed of 38,000 mph, ""Voyager-1"" covers a distance of about 335 million miles each year.  
-Galileo's 14-year mission ended in 2003 when the spacecraft was deliberately sent into Jupiter's atmosphere. Before crashing, it managed to develop a speed of 108,000 mph.
-Space probes ""Helios-1"" and ""Helios-2"" developed a speed of 147,900 mph and 153,500 mph.
-Parker Solar Probe studies the Sun flying at an incredible speed of 213,200 mph!
-In 2014, astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics recorded the highest speed in the universe. It was a piece of plasma that flew out of a black hole moving at a speed of nearly 6,000,000 mph!
-To be able to overcome the speed of light, you’d need to equip the ship with a force field. We’d reach the light limit and overcome it by just four thousandths of a mile per second. Imagine that having overcome the speed of light, we’d be catching up with photons from yesterday, then a week ago, then a month, then a year. In fact, we’d be flying through the passage of time, into the past.

Lyrics: 
And You know we destined for the win ‘cause He planned it
Who can stand against Jehovah Nissi, my banner
Marching through the city, shake the ground
The Jericho walls coming down
And You know we destined for the win cuz He planned it
Who can stand against Jehovah Nissi, my banner
Marching through the city, shake the ground
The Jericho walls coming down

Who can stand against the only One who wears the crown?
I send praises up to Heaven and them blessings coming down
I done gave my life to Christ a couple times no kidding ‘round
Every time I lose my step You never let me hit the ground

‘Cause You’re strong when I’m weak
I won’t ever face defeat
Drown my foes in the sea
I sit back ‘n hold my peace

On this land, set my feet
So now it belong to me
Broke these chains, set me free
I’m right where I’m ‘spose to be

Boy I was born to be great
Like 95’ we on the rise, Lord help me carry this weight
I’m steady sliding in His timing, I can’t ever be late
And when those lights go dim, I’m meetin Him
Right up to them gates
No, I won’t ever lose faith


Chariots of fire, yeah you know we bring the flame
I ain’t trustin in my sword, only trustin in Your Name
I got God on my side, ain’t no way that I could lose
He the first and the last, but He never number two

Speed past
Light Flash
Dark mad
Cuz I got favor from my Dad

Ready? Attack
Push enemy lines back
They waving them white flags
My aim got them turning back 

Boy I was born to be great
Like 95’ we on the rise, Lord help me carry this weight
I’m steady sliding in His timing, I can’t ever be late
And when those lights go dim I’m meetin Him
Right up to them gates
No, I won’t ever lose faith

Some may trust in horses
Some may trust in chariots
Oh but I, I’m gonna trust in the name of the Lord

Some trust in their riches
Some may trust in all they own
Oh but I, I will trust in the name of the Lord

There is wonder working power
Holy Spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in the name of Jesus

Some trust in their wisdom 
Some may say it’s foolishness
Oh but I, I will trust in the name of the Lord

I lift my eyes to the mountains the mountains above
You are You are where my help is from 
I lift my eyes to The Maker of heaven and earth
You are You are where my help is from

There is wonder working power
Holy spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in His name
There’s power in His name

I lift my eyes to the mountains the mountains above
You are You are where my help is from

SUMMARY:
- What looks like hilariously exaggerated Peter Pan shoes were actually a major fashion statement worn by wealthier aristocrat men in Poland, England, and various parts of Europe.
- Back in the Georgian Era during the 18th and 19th centuries, little miniature eyes were worn as jewelry. The trend started with the Prince of Wales at the time who would later become King George IV.
- Crazy large wigs became wildly popular among people in France after King Louis XIV started sporting the look around town. While it’s likely he used wigs to cover up his balding head.
- The tradition of long, long nails goes back to ancient times, and they were often sported by both wealthier men and women as a way to show they’d never have to use their hands to do manual labor.
-  In the 1850s and 60s, these larger-than-life hoop skirts would have a crazy wide circumference. They were actually so big that they could even save some women from drowning.
- While different parts of the world have been known to wear platform shoes in past centuries, the people of Venice took this trend to a whole new level! They’d wear “chopines,” which were typically made of wood and could be as tall as 20 inches in some cases!
- During the Victorian Era, clothing manufacturers mainly in the U.K., France, and North America would use toxic dyes to create gorgeous colors for their garments.
- Up until the end of the 19th century, Japanese women were blackening their teeth by ingesting dye in a practice called Ohaguro. They would drink this dye, which was often mixed with cinnamon and cloves for taste, once a day every few days.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hUn23hshkw

Momena waived her anonymity to talk to the BBC about what happened to her. She is still working as a policewoman, although she has changed departments.

Egypt to present ‘comprehensive vision’ for Gaza reconstruction | BBC News,"Egypt says it plans to present a “comprehensive vision"" for the reconstruction of Gaza that does not involve displacing the population, unlike a proposal put forward by US President Donald Trump.
 
In a statement, Egypt’s foreign ministry said they had an ""aspiration"" to work with the Trump administration on its plan, but stressed that any foreign intervention should ""avoid jeopardising the gains of peace.”
 
There are fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could end this weekend after Hamas said it would delay the planned hostage release.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said: “If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end.”
 
Netanyahu did not specify whether he was demanding the release of all 76 remaining hostages, or just the three due to be freed this Saturday - but an Israeli minister said he meant ""everyone"".
 
Hamas responded by saying it remained committed to the ceasefire deal and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"".

We need to talk about cholera!,"#Cholera is on the rise in many of the places where #doctorswithoutborders works. It’s a highly contagious disease that occurs in places without clean water and proper sanitation—often because of conflict, climate change and weather events. It causes profuse diarrhea and vomiting, and without treatment it can quickly lead to death by intense dehydration. Vaccination is key to preventing the spread of the disease. However, there is currently a global shortage of the oral cholera vaccine due to soaring demand and limited manufacturing capacity.",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3u061hQPM

Janne believes that climate change is caused by overconsumption - so in order to save the planet, he believes we should all consume less and waste less.
The family does have electricity but they don't have running water in the house: they use water from a lake for cooking and washing clothes.

The Great Pyramid of Giza Mystery Finally Solved,"The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the world’s famous seven wonders. It’s a real miracle that more than 4,000 years after it saw the light of day, it still stands in the sands of Egypt. But did you know that it looked completely different in those days?

The Great Pyramid was conceived as a tomb for Khufu whom you may probably know as Cheops. It remained the tallest structure created by human hand in the whole world for more than 3,800 years! Btw, it’s hard to believe, but in ancient times the crypt was mesmerizingly white... 

💥 And guys, you probably know that Ancient Egyptians held cats in the highest esteem. So we hid one at the beginning of the video! Try to spot it! 😽

#Pyramids #Egypt #brightside

SUMMARY:
- It was only in the 27th century BCE when the concept of a pyramid with smooth and evenly tilted sides that we all know today was introduced.
- Originally it rose about 480 feet above the ground, while the sides of its base were over 750 feet long. 
- It was comprised of about 2.3 million blocks of stone, and each of them had an average heft of over 2 tons. 
- The main stuff used during the construction was different types of limestone. The exterior covering that you can see these days was built up from dark limestone.
- These long rows of craggy slabs that resemble stepped pyramids rather than the usual ones were actually the inner coating or the core.
- The pyramid was lined with sparkling white limestone. That’s what initially formed the outer layer of the pyramid. 
- In 1303 CE a major earthquake hit Crete. Cairo was affected as well, and the Great Pyramid met a similar fate. 
- For hundreds of years, the ancient monument was wearing away in the wind and the sun. In the 19th century, the remaining pieces of limestone that once covered it were seized once again.
- Many adventurers who explored the site later stumbled upon the big stacks of strange debris at the foot of the pyramid. 
- One of the mysteries of the Great pyramid was the way the precious materials got to Giza in the first place. 
- The fine white stones that were really valued came from far away. They were extracted at Tura which was located on the opposite bank of the Nile, about 8 miles from the necropolis.
- It’s likely the workers used to put the stones on the wooden sleds to move them closer to the construction site. 
- The people who worked on the pyramid’s construction were, despite the popular belief, skilled and well-paid employees.

Coronavirus: WHO chief urges end to 'politicisation' of virus  - BBC News,"The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged unity, as the agency comes under continued fire from US President Donald Trump.

Speaking on Wednesday, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the WHO's work and called for an end to the politicisation of Covid-19.

The Ethiopian also said that he had received deaths threats and has been subjected to racist abuse.

Mr Trump said he would consider ending US funding for the UN agency.

He accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric"" and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response.

Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""

-------------------
also in the Programme:

Senator Bernie Sanders has ended his presidential campaign, clearing the way for former Vice-President Joe Biden to become the Democratic party's nominee.

Mr Sanders, 78, told supporters on Wednesday he saw no feasible path to get enough votes to win the nomination.

An early front-runner, the Vermont senator found success with young voters, but slipped behind Mr Biden in recent weeks.

He helped make healthcare and income inequalities key election issues.

Among the most left-leaning candidates during this year's election cycle, the self-described ""Democratic socialist"" campaigned on policies including healthcare for all, free public college, raising taxes on the wealthy and increasing minimum wage.

Mr Sanders, an Independent, had sought the Democratic presidential nomination before, losing out in 2016 to Hillary Clinton.

"The Original Fish Tacos 🐟 🌮 !! MEXICAN STREET FOOD in Ensenada, Mexico!! 🇲🇽","🎥Watch - Tijuana Street Food (Part 1): https://youtu.be/UT4hPMISonI

Welcome to Ensenada, Mexico! Known for its port and cruise ships, Ensenada is a Mexican street food and seafood paradise. In this Mexican street food tour of Ensenada, we started with a moon fish soup, then headed to eat at one of the world’s best street food stalls, ate some smoked fish, and finally finished this tour with the original fish tacos. What a day of Mexican street food in Ensenada! #Ensenada #MexicanFood #streetfood

Thanks to my friend Jeffrey Merrihue (https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/) for organizing this trip. And to Scott Koenig: https://www.instagram.com/agringoinmexico/ and Paco Perez: https://www.instagram.com/aquiestexcoco/ for arranging this tour.

La Opah Del Güero - Moonfish restaurant - On our drive from Tijuana to Ensenada, in Baja California, we stopped just outside Ensenada to eat a unique and rare soup made from moonfish. It was delicious, and incredibly comforting.

La Guerrerense - Sabina Bandera is a culinary hero. Anthony Bourdain called her stall the best street food in the world, and he was right in every way. Her warm personality is what will first invite you in - she’s one of the friendliest ladies in the world. That paired with her unbelievable seafood combinations on top of tostadas and sauces your tongue can’t believe, and you truly have one of the best street food stalls in the world. It was unbelievable, I’m still dreaming about the tostadas at La Guerrerense.

Ahumadora Pacifico - Smoked Fish - Next we stopped around the corner for some Ensenada style smoked fish.

Tacos Fenix - Fish Tacos - Known for serving the original fish tacos, there is no way you want to miss this Mexican street food treasure in Ensenada. It’s simple and delicious and nothing more and nothing less than you want it to be. Fried fish, fresh tortilla, salsas, and cabbage.

Tacos Corona - Fish Tacos - Additionally, across the street, there’s another fish taco stall that some mentioned they loved as well. And so naturally we needed to try both. Tacos Corona were amazing, fresh fish, great tortilla, and again, a myriad of delicious salsas. 

And that completes this amazing Mexican street food tour of Ensenada, it was an incredible day or dreamworthy tacos and tostadas.

Humanity is reaching a turning point on climate change says UK PM - BBC News,"A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the ""turning point for humanity"", UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations.

He warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming.

Four areas needed tackling - ""coal, cars, cash and trees"", he said.

Countries must take responsibility for ""the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves"".

""It's time for humanity to grow up,"" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow.

LYRICS:
My friends, they know I won’t pick up if they call me
One day a year
And that one day is here
My tears just like a summer rain are falling
It’s just what they do
When I start missing you

Why’d you have to go
Why’d I have to stay
When’s it gonna get easier
To make it through the day

I go out walking
I ain’t much for talking
Just thinking and crying
And praying and trying
To make sense
Of what don’t make sense in this life
Like why you’re up there
And not here by my side
They say it’s gonna get easier
And I want to believe that’s true
It’s just harder on the seventh of June

I’ve been singing songs ever since the day you left me
Crazy how my life has changed
Every night a different stage
And sometimes it feels like you and God are watching
Are you looking down on me
I wonder if you’re proud of me

I miss you
Oh I miss you

My friends, they know I won’t pick up if they call me
On the seventh of June
It’s just me and you

10 Easy Ways to Relieve  Stomach Bloating,"How to Get Rid of Stomach Bloating. Bloating is one of the most common ad annoying stomach problems. If your stomach is particularly unhappy after a heavy meal or when your diet is far from ideal, it’s most likely to be bloating. In case you have determined that bloating is the problem you're suffering from, here are 10 ways to save yourself from the annoying pains it brings. 
You can prevent bloating by eating more slowly and choosing smaller portions. Yes, sometimes it's as easy as that! Try to keep the amount you eat in check. Steaming or boiling green vegetables will shrink the amount of sugar you take in. If you keep getting bloated, you might want to watch your salt intake. Eating high-sodium foods can slow down your body’s ability to get rid of excess water, which might make you feel like there’s a balloon in your stomach.

SUMMARY
-If you pay attention to what you're eating and try to be more mindful of your food intake, this might help you enjoy food more.
-Kale, broccoli, and cabbage are indeed the nutrient-rich and high-fiber vegetables have raffinose in them. Its fermentation produces gas, and that's exactly what causes you to bloat.
-Eating high-sodium foods can slow down your body’s ability to get rid of excess water, which might make you feel like there’s a balloon in your stomach.
-Bananas are full of potassium, and they perfectly regulate salt levels and, therefore, reduce bloating.
-Both peppermint and chamomile tea are known to relax the spasms in your stomach and ease your pain if you feel bloated.
-Probiotics help regulate gas production and bloating.
-Sugary alcohols may cause some problems for your stomach because they often reach the bacteria in the lower part of your digestive tract.
-If you overeat and start to feel that uncomfortable gas rising in your stomach, you may want to lie down and ask somebody to give you an abdominal massage.
-There are various poses that can assist you in easing the tightness in your belly. They help your digestive tract move the food along, stimulate your organs, and relieve the stress that partially causes bloating. 
-Your daily water intake is supposed to be around 8 glasses, and this does not include all the other fluids you drink.

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky rift over Ukraine war continues | BBC News,"The rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents over Russia has continued, with White House officials accusing Volodymyr Zelensky of insulting Donald Trump.

On Wednesday, Mr Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of its rare earth minerals - a ""deal"" Mr Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.

A Mysterious Place No People No Animals Can Approach,"It was the summer of 1949. Young geologist Vadim Kolpakov was on a mission to northern Russia in the Irkutsk region. His job was to draw a geological map of the area. While on duty, he came across something so mysterious and remarkable, it’d continue to puzzle experts decades later… ooh, what could it be?

Though it’s now more famous as the Patomskiy Crater, locals had dubbed it Fire Eagle Nest, probably because it looks like a giant bird nest sitting on the hill. It rises 130 ft in the air, half as tall as a Giant Sequoia. The cone-like structure’s base has a diameter of 520 ft, almost as wide as the Seattle Space Needle is tall. But what was hiding inside would be the most surprising and baffling discovery! Let's find out more about one of the most mysterious places in the world?

Camera Captures Orion Abort Test Mid-Air,"During the successful test of Orion’s launch abort system, known as Ascent Abort-2, a camera mounted on a ring connecting the crew module and launch abort system to its booster captured a view of Orion escaping the booster. After the booster separated, its motor continued to burn for several seconds and maintained stability, which allowed for a clear, mid-air view of the Orion elements continuing to execute the abort test. About 27 seconds after the abort is initiated and the Orion elements separate from the booster, the launch abort system’s jettison motor is seen firing, releasing the capsule. The July 2 test demonstrated the Orion’s launch abort system works during high-stress aerodynamic conditions and can pull the capsule to safety if an emergency ever arises during launch. The test was a critical milestone needed to help pave the way for Artemis missions with astronauts.

25 Things People Throw Away But They Cost a Lot,"How to reuse old things. Are you taking this old ice tray to the trash bin? And these old sneakers too? Please, don't - old things can have amazing new uses. Or you can sell this seemingly useless stuff online and earn a fortune! So if you're looking for repurposing ideas, we got something interesting for you.  

Did you know, for example, that a simple piece of paper you don't usually hesitate to throw away can be sold for thousands of dollars several years later if it's related to some important event, for example, a remarkable baseball match? You can also try to sell empty boxes, pine cones, and even... used toilet paper rolls!

UK ministers Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resign from government - BBC News,"The UK chancellor and health secretary have resigned from government, saying they no longer have confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Rishi Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"", while Sajid Javid said government was not ""acting in the national interest"".

Meanwhile, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has been picked as chancellor and Steve Barclay, Johnson's chief of staff, now becomes health secretary.

The two resignations came minutes after the PM apologised for appointing MP Chris Pincher to a government role after being told about a misconduct complaint against the MP.

Mr Pincher has denied allegations of sexual misconduct.

Let's see what other scary things would happen to the world without chicken eggs!

How Flowers of Strange Colors Are Created,"Scientists have done something incredible - they've created the world's first artificially engineered blue rose! To make the blue rose, they injected special bacteria with the super pigment genes into a white rose petal. There are still some things to figure out. The blue color doesn't last long, and it's only visible in specific parts of the petal. The researchers are continuing their work to engineer roses that can produce the blue pigment naturally, without the need for injections.

beabadoobee - Worth It (Live) Vevo DSCVR,"Beabadoobee - Worth It. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.
 
Few songs embody the phenomenon of “blowin’ up on TikTok” better than beabadoobee’s “death bed (coffee for your head)” with powfu. The viral hit has been an early career milestone for beabadoobee, whose real name is Beatrice Laus. But let’s be real: She was already making big time moves. Extensive touring with The 1975 and Phoebe Bridgers brought her nostalgic brand of roaring melodic alt-rock to every corner of the US and UK. Her ‘Fake It Flowers' debut album arrives in October, but the beabadoobee discography is already deep - she’s been releasing tracks since 2017. It’s also varied - ranging between soft lullabies and thrashing breakdowns. Our DSCVR series has captured both sides of her vibe. In the middle of the quarantine, she performed acoustic iterations of “Sorry” and “Care” from the safety of her home. Now, following all the proper guidelines, our UK studio has been cleared for re-opening. And as much as we all loved her first round of DSCVR performances, we sure missed the drums, the fuzzy guitar, the infectious camaraderie. Bea and her crew squeezed every ounce of energy out of “Care” and “Worth It.” And, boy, did they look like they were enjoying rockin’ together again.

Alaina Castillo - pocket locket (Live Session) | Vevo DSCVR,"Alaina Castillo  - pocket locket. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

“Since I can’t say stuff to people’s faces, might as well sing it.” So says the somewhat introverted Alaina Castillo. A self-professed shy girl, the Houston-raised, LA-based singer-songwriter is one of those performers who’s much more comfortable entertaining people in front of a camera than she is making small talk face to face. Vlogging and singing covers in ASMR on YouTube was the longtime Elvis fan’s original outlet. A few of those covers, like her spin on Billie Eilish’s “lovely"" say,  now boast millions of views. Singing comes naturally to Castillo, who’s been sharpening her skills since youth church choir days back in Texas. While in college, she began writing songs from her own perspective, penning lyrics in both Spanish and English. 2019’s ‘antisocial butterfly’ was her proper debut EP, a collection of bilingual bops that quickly garnered some buzz. “Just A Boy” dropped a year later and immediately took off, positioning the girl with the dyed locks as an artist with a future. In May, her debut album arrived - well, the first half it, at least. Like a diary, ‘parallel universe pt 1’ contains intimate odes to weed, romance, and personal wellbeing. Spacey and sensual, ‘pocket locket’ is one of ’em, and it sounded great in our DSCVR studio. “just a boy” did too. Prepare to be captivated.

India: Women defy historic temple ban - BBC News,"A centuries old ban was broken when two women walked into a South Indian shrine.
The women, devotees of the temple deity, Lord Ayyappa, entered around dawn.

The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. A Supreme Court decision in September 2018 overturned the ban but protesters had stopped women from entering.

After today's event, more violent protests took place.

25 Traditions That Are Totally Normal in Other Countries,"“So many countries, so many customs.” Any jet-setter will agree this good old proverb is true. In the age of globalization, going places has become an essential part of our life. We’re all well aware of the fact that while visiting a foreign country, we must obey certain local traditions and common rules.

What would you do if you walked into a bathroom and instead of toilet paper, you found a bowl of water? And no instructions either!  Or, what if warding off bad luck meant talking to birds at the park? Sure, these things may seem wacky to you, but they’re pretty normal customs in other countries. And some actually sound pretty fun!

SUMMARY:
- In Germany, if you’re 25 and single, your friends will often lead you to your birthday party with a string of old socks as you celebrate with drinks.
- In the States, “pull my finger” is a risky - smelly - game. But in Scandinavia Austria, and Bavaria, Germany, finger pulling (or Fingerhakeln) is a competitive sport!
- If you’re going on vacation and want to leave with as many good vibes as possible, sit down with your household first before you head out the door. In Russia, they believe that doing this ensures you have a good trip and wards off bad luck.
- In Denmark, if it’s your 25th birthday or higher and you’re still single, your friends and family throw handfuls of cinnamon at you. 
-  If you were to spit at your boss or a family member when you greeted them, it’d be considered pretty darn rude. But in the Maasai tribe in Kenya and northern Tanzania, spitting into their hands before a handshake is considered appropriate and respectful.
- You might gift newlyweds with some sparkling new china, but in Germany, family and friends actually break dishes the night before a wedding!
- In Venezuela, the early bird doesn’t necessarily get the worm. There, running late isn’t a problem the way it is in the US and other countries. When it comes to parties or even work meetings, arriving a few minutes late isn’t considered rude. 
- In South Africa, the tradition of chucking chairs, tables, and whatever furniture out the window onto the street for the New Year has been going strong since the end of apartheid. 
- Even if you’re naturally a leftie, using this hand is considered pretty rude in a lot of Middle Eastern countries. This is because the left hand is the designated “cleaning hand” in the bathroom and, therefore, it’s the dirty one.
- f your biggest fear is doing your business in a restroom that’s run out of toilet paper, well…you might have some problems when visiting India. That’s because in most parts of this country, instead of toilet paper, people use water to cleanse their, uh, private areas. 
-  In Thailand, there are tons of stray monkeys hanging around. And once a year in Lopburi, Bangkok, people dump over 6,600 pounds (3,000 kg) of fruits and veggies out for the little guys to munch on in what’s referred to as the Monkey Buffet Festival.
- While we consider it bad luck to see the bride before the big day, people in Tidong, Indonesia believe using the toilet 3 days after the wedding is bad luck.
- Americans are used to having copious amounts of ice in their drinks. But in many places in Europe, having little or no ice at all is the norm. 
- If you ever visit Fiji, you’ll likely be greeted by a cocktail containing juice from squeezed roots served in a wooden bowl known as Kava. And apparently, it has, shall we say “psychoactive effects.”

Jessica Winter - Like A Knife (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022,"Jessica Winter - Like A Knife. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

“Sad Music,” “Psycho,” “Little Problem,” “Funeral” - don’t turn to Jessica Winter looking for sunshine and rainbows. The UK singer-producer has created an intriguing musical world by addressing life’s travails. She makes it vivid by giving what are ostensibly dirges a fierce beat and pop sheen inspired by the goth/industrial heroes from her youth, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and Nine Inch Nails. Darkness is an ally, and Winter uses it to craft a persona and make memorable tunes. “I just spoke to Cupid, he told me that we're far from Heaven/ I know that we're dying, it's not from lack of trying,” she sings in “Funeral.” The eerie soundscape exemplifies how aura can be just as potent as a hook. It also tilts towards a unique balance in Winter’s music: waxing melancholy doesn’t prevent you from dancing the night away. One critic said her track “The Other” has a “Giorgio Moroder-meets-Kate Bush shimmer.” Dead on. Winter took to classical piano as a kid because she was restricted by the brace she wore due to hip dysplasia. It was a long road of healing from there, with numerous hospital procedures that forced the use of wheelchairs and crutches through her mid-teens. Isolation is something she knows about. The singer spent the last decade honing her craft as well as honing an eloquence at what some call sadbangers. How eloquent? The Cure’s Robert Smith has called her “Sad Music” one of his favorite modern songs. Her new ‘More Sad Music’ EP boasts jewels like “Do You Do You,” and “I Think You’re Going To Hurt Me (So Bad).” Watch her lift off in our DSCVR Artists To Watch performances, and you’ll find out how much fun gloom can be.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

Penis fillers, designed to increase the organ's girth, are gaining in popularity - despite warnings over complications. Two men tell the BBC why they are not ashamed to have them.

A penis filler is a liquid - usually hyaluronic acid - which is injected into the soft tissue under the skin of the shaft.
It is a non-surgical procedure and can be done in a matter of hours at a specialist clinic. It costs around £3,000 a time.

It is designed to increase a man's flaccid girth, usually by one or two centimetres in circumference - depending on the amount injected - and lasts for around 18 months.",People & Blogs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q1jKhD8UZ0

Young Israelis and Emiratis meet online after peace deal - BBC News,"It’s now possible to make direct phone calls and book flights between Israel and the United Arab Emirates for the first time, after the two countries agreed to normalise relations last month.

The UAE is the first Arab state in 26 years to make peace with Israel - following Egypt and Jordan.

As officials discuss opening up embassies, travel and trade, some young people from both countries have begun meeting online to find out more about each other.

The initiative began with the Tel Aviv-based non-governmental organisation ISRAEL-is, which linked up with members and former members of the Emirates Youth Council.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Coronavirus: How to fly during a pandemic - BBC News,"Jumping on a plane and going on holiday looks and feels very different to how it did at the start of 2020.

Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again.

These include measures that help reduce the chances of coronavirus being spread, help ensure social distancing and reduce the number of things passengers need to touch known as 'contact points'.

The UK government has released advice on what you can do to keep safe while flying. It's currently reviewing it's measures on asking people to quarantine when they return to the UK.

Here BBC Health and Science Correspondent, Laura Foster, has been to Southend Airport to show you what you need to do if you're thinking of catching a flight.

What Are the Different Earth Orbits? | Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains…,"What are the different Earth orbits? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice explore getting into orbit, what each level of orbit means, and how they are used. Also, how would a space elevator work?

What is a geosynchronous orbit? Geostationary? We discuss how Isaac Newton figured out the speed an object would need to get into orbit. What is low Earth orbit versus middle Earth orbit? The answer, we promise, has nothing to do with the presence of hobbits. Learn about plans to create an elevator to space. Why would it be useful and how could we do it? Plus, what would the space elevator music be?

Chaos at Kabul airport as Afghans try to flee Taliban - BBC News,"US troops are taking control of Kabul's international airport, as desperate residents try to flee the city following the Taliban's return to Kabul.

The US military has secured the site and is taking over air traffic control to evacuate American and allied staff.

But commercial flights have mostly been suspended, stranding hundreds of Afghans and other foreign nationals.

Footage shared online showed hundreds of people running towards the airport after the militants took control of the presidential palace on Sunday.

Would You Survive In a Universe Made of Antimatter,"What if the universe was made of antimatter? Well, things would be pretty wild! Antimatter is like a mirror image of regular matter, and if it touched normal matter, they’d both explode in a burst of energy. So, if everything in the universe was antimatter, we’d never notice a difference because all the rules would still work the same, but we'd have to avoid any regular matter. The biggest issue is if even a tiny bit of normal matter showed up, it would cause a massive blast. Luckily, our universe is mostly matter, so we don't have to worry about that happening! It's fun to imagine, though, how a whole antimatter universe could exist somewhere else, far away.

Putin says ball in West's court on Ukraine - BBC News,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on the West to give immediate security guarantees to defuse a crisis prompted by Russia's military build-up near Ukraine's borders.

During his lengthy annual press conference, Mr Putin demanded that Nato abandon military activity in Eastern Europe and not admit Ukraine as a member. He has threatened military measures but denies planning to invade Ukraine.

Ukraine security officials say more than 100,000 Russian troops have been sent close to its borders, and US President Joe Biden has threatened Mr Putin with sanctions if Ukraine comes under attack.

The Russian leader said military measures were not his preferred choice and he expressed hope that talks would take place with the US early next year in Geneva.

10 Unbelievable True Stories That Will Blow Your Mind,"History consists of a lot of different events, and some of them are so hilarious and weird that they resemble the plot of a movie or a cartoon. Did you know, for example, that in the 15th-19th centuries, Europeans bought mummies to make medicines out of them? Or that 150 years ago, engineers literally raised Chicago together with all of its buildings and streets by a few feet? 

Life is really the best scriptwriter there is! Some historical moments sound crazy, but they are actually true. You think baboon can't work for the railroad? Actually, it can. A baboon named Jack worked at the station for 9 years and never made a single mistake! So guys, here're some craziest stories that ever happened in real life. But pay attention, 'cause one of them is not what it seems...

SUMMARY:
- The baboon named Jack worked at the station for 9 years and never made a single mistake! The railway even employed him officially, paying the baboon about 20 cents a day. Jack's service ended in 1890, though – he died of tuberculosis. 
- German musicians and philosophers decided to play a musical piece for ages and chose John Cage's Organ²/ASLSP for the job. They followed the composer's instructions to play it “as slow as possible” and thought that 639 years would be just enough. 
- In the 19th century, Chicago was just a few feet above the Lake Michigan water level which brought all kinds of problems. It took about two decades to raise the city up. And the most exceptional thing is that Chicago's busy life never stopped!
- Ewa Wisnierska decided to fly a little to prepare for the upcoming paragliding world championship. Eventually, Wisnierska got trapped in the upraft of two thunderstorms! No matter how much she tried to get out, she was still lifted to a height of more than 32,000 feet (9,700 m).
- In 1971 a baby seal was found on the shore. As it turned out, its mother had died, so a man named George Swallow took it home and named it Hoover. Hoover grew pretty fast and spent tons of time with his “dad,” slowly mimicking George's accent and catchphrases. 
- In 1956, a fearless American pilot, Thomas Fitzpatrick, made a bet that he could land a plane on the streets of New York. He stole a single engine plane from the Teterboro School of Aeronautics in New Jersey and flew it all the way to New York, winning the bet.
- In 2007 two of the cutest penguins, Grape-kun and his mate Midori, were transferred to Tobu Zoo. At this point these lovebirds had been together for almost a decade! However, this didn't stop Midori from leaving Grape-kun for a younger penguin. This really broke Grape-kun. That was until the zoo decided to put up a cutout of the anime character Hululu near Grape-kun's enclosure. Believe it or not, the penguin fell in love! 
- Back in 1726 England had one of the biggest controversies of its long history. A young woman named Mary Toft gave birth to something that looked a lot like several animal parts. Some of them looked a lot like rabbit pieces.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ttAx7KCnfE

4 Types of Toxic Cookware to Avoid and 4 Safe Alternatives,"We all know the importance of eating healthy, but not everyone knows that the cookware you use to prepare your dishes is just as important as the food itself. Even the healthiest diet can result in severe health problems if your pots and pans are toxic. Find out which cookware you should avoid by all means for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
The non-stick properties of Teflon cookware are achieved with a coating of PTFE. This is a plastic polymer that, when heated above 572°F, starts to release toxins. These toxic fumes lead to flu-like symptoms called polymer fume fever, informally known as Teflon flu. Another chemical compound found in Teflon cookware is especially threatening since it tends to stay in the body (as well as in the environment) for long periods of time. Try cast-iron cookware instead. It even comes in non-stick varieties. It doesn't leak anything toxic into your food and is actually a nice natural way to increase your body’s iron levels.
Though aluminum cookware is usually coated, the coating is prone to chipping, allowing the toxic metal to get right into your food. As for aluminum foil, using it while cooking is even more dangerous. In fact, there’s an established safe amount of aluminum the human body can manage daily, and that’s 20 mg per pound of body weight a day. When you wrap your food in aluminum foil and cook it this way, the amount of this substance that leaks into the food significantly exceeds the permissible level. Consider using glass cookware instead. 
If you’ve just enjoyed some fish in lemon juice or stewed tomatoes cooked in an uncoated copper pot and you find yourself suffering from extremely unpleasant symptoms (such as vomiting blood, light-headedness, yellowy skin, or gastrointestinal distress, among others) call 911 immediately.  Try this safe alternative instead: stainless steel. Just make sure you're buying food-grade stainless steel since this is the only type that doesn't contain any nickel or chromium.
Soft ceramic coating isn't durable enough and starts chipping after a few months of daily use. When this happens, lead and cadmium sometimes found in the coating will end up in your food and, thus, in your body. Lead poisoning is one of the most dangerous types of metal poisoning and can result in abdominal pain, headaches, infertility, and other health complications. Try this safe alternative instead: 100% ceramic cookware. 

TIMESTAMPS
Teflon cookware 0:38
Aluminum cookware and aluminum foil 3:31
Copper cookware 5:12
Ceramic-coated cookware 6:54

SUMMARY
-Teflon contains plastic polymer that, when heated above 572°F, starts to release toxins. Try this safe alternative instead: real cast-iron. This is a nontoxic cooking option that truly withstands the test of time. It heats well and evenly throughout.
-Aluminum is a neurotoxic metal. Elevated levels of aluminum in the body have been linked to several central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer's and ALS. Try this safe alternative instead: glass cookware. It’ll never release anything toxic when heated, it doesn’t hold onto any old flavors or odors, and it's not only durable but also eco-friendly.
-Copper cookware, especially when it isn’t coated, can easily send you to the ER with a bad case of metal poisoning. And that’s because it can release copper when you cook acidic foods. Stainless steel is a great cookware option: it's relatively lightweight, scratch-resistant, and comes in non-stick varieties.
-Soft ceramic coating isn't durable enough and starts chipping after a few months of daily use. When this happens, lead and cadmium sometimes found in the coating will end up in your food and, thus, in your body. Try this safe alternative instead: 100% ceramic cookware. This is one of the best and safest options out there since it's made with completely natural materials, it isn't toxic, and it won't chip or peel off.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Do we really need a new Chernobyl?,"Thirty-five years on, while scientists are still studying the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, governments and companies are laying foundations for new nuclear tragedies.

What the world really needs is for governments and companies to stop introducing new nuclear risks when we still cannot cope with the existing ones. The only way to do this is to phase out nuclear energy and switch to renewables as soon as possible.",Nonprofits & Activism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uPzbH-KxY8

Je veux de la lumière
Je veux voir à travers ta peau
Je veux voir le monde
Je veux tout, je veux chaque seconde
Je veux que l’on vive fort
Je veux que l’on vive vite
Je veux que le diable l'emporte
Un jour on prendra la fuite
Je veux tout et tout autour
Je veux sans mesure du possible
Tu sais tout est question d’amour
Puisqu’on tombe dans le vide
On danse solo dans l’espace
À l’aventure dans les néons
Je veux en démesure, je veux en millions
Donner des titres à nos saisons

Je veux, je veux, je veux
Je veux, je veux
Je veux vivre debout
Je veux, je veux, je veux
Je veux, je veux
Je veux tout prendre et prendre tout
Je veux, je veux, je veux
Je veux, je veux
Je veux vivre debout (je veux)
Je veux vivre debout (je veux)

Je veux, enfin non, je veux pas de certitudes
Je veux pas de logique, d’exactitude
Je veux que ma tête bouge à chaque battement de cœur
Je veux que nos corps se touchent
Je veux avaler tes peurs
Je veux dévorer les tropiques
Que tu tournes 7 fois ta langue dans ma bouche
Je veux dévaler les à-pics
Attendre que le soleil s'y couche
Je veux sauter dans le vide
Ne jamais revenir
Je veux jamais dire jamais
Je veux partir et repartir
Je veux prendre et puis donner

Je veux, je veux, je veux
Je veux, je veux
Je veux vivre debout
Je veux, je veux, je veux
Je veux, je veux
Je veux tout prendre et prendre tout
Je veux, je veux, je veux

Sody - Bedroom Ceiling (Live) | Vevo DSCVR At Home,"Sody - Bedroom Ceiling. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

London-bred singer/songwriter Sody is an unabashed pop stan who is equally determined to change her fave genre from within. That her dream collaborative partner is pop paragon Ed Sheeran is all the evidence needed of her unbridled aspirations of pop stardom. Her own discography, however, displays preference towards a songwriting style steeped in emotion and honesty. For example, take “The Bully.” In the music  video, actors of every background and color - those who would feel marginalized - sing her lyrics, including “I feel sorry for your conscience/Does it eat you up?” A little while back, we managed to catch up with Sody amidst unprecedented circumstances. With sun shining through her window, the singer transformed her home into an oasis of feelings. “Charlotte” and “Bedroom Ceiling” both come on the heels of ‘I’m Sorry, I’m Not Sorry,’ her unapologetically raw - and instrumentally sparse - EP from early 2020 aka forever ago. Crystal clear, her voice conveys a rare mixture of sadness and empathy that’s sure to hit you in the heart.

Shaybo - Dobale (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2021,"Shaybo - Dobale. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Stand back a bit when Shaybo’s going off. With a mic in her hand, the UK sensation spits with a power that’s a little daunting - and that’s a good thing. Ferociousness is one of the attributes that has earned the South London rapper a recent groundswell of fans. Blistering tracks such as “Dobale,” “Anger” and “Daily Duppy” command your attention instantly. And Shaybo’s flow flies around those beats with a swooping authority. The self-proclaimed Queen of the South has a novel emergence story. Her Nigerian family moved to London when she was six. She started rapping in her early teens, when Nicki Minaj’s music provided an inspirational perspective that male MCs couldn’t. She learned to rap by battling all comers in the school yard. The focus that marks her current work is evident “Female Eruption,” which she made at 13, surrounded by a lady squad and riding a dancehall groove. She’s long deemed herself a tomboy from the hood, whose short fuse - whether with romance or societal woes - often got her in trouble. When her parents asked her to hit uni before carrying on with music, she studied social work, assisting survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire. But one way to push an agenda of equality is to inspire women to use their voices, and when music grabbed her in her third year, she left school and got back in the game. “I don’t want to glamorize confrontation or fighting,” she’s said, “but I do want to glamorize women sticking up for themselves.” Now tastemakers are shouting her out, Lily Allen and Katy B are texting and her ‘Queen of the South’ EP is almost here. Shaped by Ghanian producer Guiltybeatz, it shows Shaybo in a wider lens, tapping the brakes on drill beats, and stressing versatility. But don’t worry, the fierceness hasn’t vanished. The rat-a-tat cadence driving her ATW performances of “Daily Duppy” and “Dobale” is intense.

In this animated retelling of the Book of Exodus, Egyptian Prince Moses (Val Kilmer), upon discovering his roots as a Jewish slave, embarks on a quest to free his people from bondage. When his plea is denied by his brother Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), the new pharaoh, a series of horrific plagues strike Egypt. Moses finally leads the Israelites to freedom by parting the Red Sea and drowning the Egyptian army. God then gives Moses the Ten Commandments, a list of rules for his people to live by.

Hundreds of South Africans dig for 'diamonds' - BBC News,"Hundreds of people have descended  on a small village in Kwa-Zulu Natal, digging for 'diamonds'. 

This comes after a man herding cattle discovered what he thought were diamonds more than week ago. His discovery has prompted people from other provinces to make the trek to join in the search. Some people have found what they believe are precious stones. 

Police are also at the scene but appear to be struggling to stop people from digging. The provincial government has described this activity as illegal mining.

There Is a Reason Why Police Cars Are Black and White,"When you hear a police siren blaring around the corner, you’re already expecting to see a sedan painted in certain colors rushing past you. But have you ever wondered why exactly police cars are painted in colors they use? In fact, there are plenty of reasons for that in any given country. 

Let’s take the USA and Canada for example. When first North American police cars appeared in the early 1900s, pretty much all automobiles were painted black, and law enforcers weren’t any exception. Later, most authorities across the US thought it prudent to make police cars easily recognizable to the public. And so they worked out a color palette that would be both symbolic and affordable for the budget.

USA. FLORIDA. MIAMI BEACH. APRIL - 14, 2017: POLICE CAR: By  SergeevDen/Shutterstock.com, https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/usa-florida-miami-beach-april-14-621090572 
Animation is created by Bright Side.

SUMMARY:
- A monochrome design proved to be very efficient: people would instantly recognize a police car as such, and it was also not hard to give it another paint job in case it was given to a detective or an undercover officer.
- With the appearance of vinyl decals, however, it became increasingly easy to paint a car in whatever colors you wanted. 
- Originally, most police cars in Europe and the UK were white with distinct markings on them in either black, blue, or red. 
- But then, in the 1990s, the revolution came: the Battenburg markings. Developed in the UK, this distinct pattern became a standard for the British, Australian, and many of the European police cars. 
- The markings look like alternating squares of two different colors — kinda like a chess board.
- The reason for such a radical redesign is simple enough: making the emergency services highly visible.
- Only the emergency services are allowed to bear them, which makes these vehicles immediately recognizable even in the heavy traffic.
- In the Czech Republic, for example, most police vehicles have striped decals running along the bottom of the side of the car. 
- When light-reflecting stripes are put lower on the body of a car, they always get enough light to be seen for what they are.
- But probably the most visible police cars ever reside in Dubai. The police force in that wealthy city has perhaps the most expensive set of vehicles in the world. 
- Dubai creates a picture of the richest and most luxurious city in the world, and having their police officers drive around in Lamborghinis and Ferraris does a lot to add to this image.
- Police vehicles are generally more powerful than those available to the public. All around the world, governments place special orders for their police cars.
- There’s one thing the police have that makes almost every car chase a success: communication. And that’s the only real advantage of the police cars.

SERBIA   Inhumane treatment on Europe's borders,"Please  Subscribe: MSF International Channel  For Humanity   🆘
Your Comments  And Likes is Your  Feedback.
We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

11 Popular Food Combinations It's Better to Eat,"When we need to make dinner or grab a quick snack, we often combine food without thinking much about it. But some popular food combinations can affect your body and even lead to health problems. 

TIMESTAMPS
Muffin and orange juice 0:40
Meat and cheese 1:29
Eggs and fish 2:23
Cellulose and spinach 3:26
Tea and yeast dough 4:15
Yogurt and kiwi 4:54
Melon and milk 5:35
Pizza and soda 6:16
Wine and cake 7:09
Fruit with vegetables 8:00
Burger and fries 8:45

Muffin and orange juice 0:40
Some breakfasts leave you with no energy instead of helping you to kickstart your day, and a muffin with orange juice is one of them. This combination contains no protein or cellulose — just a huge amount of carbohydrates. This makes your blood sugar level soar and then dramatically decrease. Moreover, your work efficiency and stamina will also decrease. So instead of putting these 2 together, try another breakfast combo: a wholegrain muffin and some natural yogurt.

Meat and cheese 1:29
Cheese contains calcium, and meat contains iron and zinc. When combined, calcium slows down the absorption of both zinc and iron, so our digestive system can't get all the proper nutrients from these products. It's better to make sure that cheese and meat aren't on the list of ingredients for your meal. Instead, combine meat with Bulgarian pepper or cabbage as the vitamin C they contain aids iron absorption.

Tea and yeast dough 4:15
Tasty croissants or buns with a cup of tea can easily result in an unpleasant feeling of heaviness in your stomach and even fermentation in your gut. This happens because tea contains tannins, which make it harder for certain elements and nutrients (including iron and vitamin B1) to be absorbed, and this can hurt your nervous system. The answer is to consume tannins and caffeine-rich beverages at least an hour after your meal.

Pizza and soda 6:16
Most pizzas contain cheese, which, when accompanied with cold beverages, can cause indigestion. The carbs, starch, and protein in pizza don't aid digestion either. And pizza isn't the only guilty component in this combo! The sugar in soda also slows down your digestion. Consider all of these processes happening at the same time.

SUMMARY
-Muffin and orange juice combination contains no protein or cellulose — just a huge amount of carbohydrates. This makes your blood sugar level soar and then dramatically decrease.
-Cheese contains calcium, and meat contains iron and zinc. When combined, calcium slows down the absorption of both zinc and iron, so our digestive system can't get all the proper nutrients from these products.
-If you put eggs together with fish, you can forget about any of their health benefits.
-Whole grains contain cellulose, which, when put together with the oxalic acid in greens, blocks the absorption of calcium.
-Tea contains tannins, which make it harder for certain elements and nutrients (including iron and vitamin B1) to be absorbed, and this can hurt your nervous system.
-The enzymes in kiwis lead to the accelerated decomposition of milk proteins. That's why natural milk often tastes a little bitter with kiwi products.
-In an acidic environment, milk tends to clot into a hard-to-digest mass. Worse still, a melon milkshake is one of the most effective ways to upset your stomach.
-Most pizzas contain cheese, which, when accompanied with cold beverages, can cause indigestion.
-Alcohol massively influences your blood sugar level and increases insulin production. That's why the sugar from your dessert quickly turns into fat on your belly and thighs.
-Fruit and vegetables digest differently and thus shouldn’t be eaten together.
-Burger and fries combo contains a huge amount of trans fat, which can lead to cholesterol problems and heart-related diseases.

"Qasem Soleimani: Strike was to 'stop war', says Trump - BBC News","President Donald Trump said the US killed Iran's top military commander Qasem Soleimani ""to stop a war, not to start one"".

Mr Trump said Soleimani's ""reign of terror"" was ""over"" following a strike at Iraq's Baghdad airport on Friday.

Soleimani spearheaded Iran's Middle East operations as leader of the country's Quds Force. Iran vowed to take ""severe revenge"" over his death.

The killing marked a major escalation in tensions between Iran and the US.

US officials said 3,000 additional troops would be sent to the Middle East as a precaution.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Today we celebrated Carnaval in La Paz, Bolivia, which we learned meant dressing up and running around and spraying people with foam. Here's the official definition according to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The Carnival of Oruro is a religious festival dating back more than 200 years that takes place in Oruro, Bolivia. It is one of UNESCO's Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Originally an indigenous festival, the celebration later was transformed to incorporate a Christian ritual around the Virgin of Candelaria (Virgin of Socavón), which takes place on March 2. The traditional Llama llama or Diablada became the leading traditional dance of the festival. Throughout the festival, more than 48 groups of folk dancers specializing in 18 different folk dances perform a pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Tunnel every Saturday of the carnival in a traditional parade.

***TRAVEL VLOG 324***
Song by Andrew Applepie: Flic En Flac
 http://andrewapplepie.com | http://youtube.com/andrewapplepie

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Thoughts on Apple Vision Pro and WWDC 2023!,"It's WWDC time! In this episode we break down everything Apple announced at its annual developer conference, from iOS to MacOS to.. VisionOS? Unfortunately, in order to fit everything we had to skip on doing trivia in this episode, but don't worry! If wacky tech trivia is what you live for (like us), we did a trivia collab with the Vergecast where we went head-to-head so make sure to check that out! We also hopped on at the end of their emergency WWDC podcast for a fun lightning round at the end. There's a ton to get into with everything that Apple announced.

CEBU, PHILIPPINES - Cebu is one of the food capitals of the Philippines and there’s no better way to jump into the local Filipino food culture than with a huge Su-To-Kil meal! Today I’m meeting up with my friend Carlo from Kalami Cebu, and we’re going to order a huge meal, including a giant Cobia fish belly grill!

Kalami Cebu - First of all a huge thank you to Carlo, from @KalamiCebu He’s a local from Cebu that is probably the most knowledgeable guy about the local food of Cebu. He’s so much fun to hang out and eat with. Go check his content out for great tips on where to eat in Cebu.

Parr’t Ebelle Seafood Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/SthzwRnUtuW6PQWn6) - Today for lunch we’re heading straight to Parr’t Ebelle Tinola, a restaurant that’s known for its giant fish grill, and for its fish soup called tinola. Altogether the popular combination is called Su-To-Kil: sugba (grill), tola (soup), kilaw (marinated in vinegar). It’s a legendary Filipino food combination that can be made from all fish in different cooking methods so you have a complete meal.

Parr’t Ebelle Tinola is one of the most popular and famous tinola and sutokil meals in Cebu. Everyday the restaurant is absolutely jam packed and after tasting all the food - now we know why. It’s so tasty and the quality is so good. With Carlo’s expertise, we ordered the giant Cobia fish belly, the local favorite fish - it was huge. The belly was so delicious, dipped in soy sauce and vinegar and combined with vinegared fish (kinilaw), grape seaweed, and 2 varieties of fish head soup.

Highly recommended Parr’t Ebelle Tinola is a restaurant you have to try when you’re in Cebu, Philippines!

Price - 2,996 PHP ($54.25 US) for everything

French election:  Left celebrates as far-Right faces surprise defeat | BBC News,"France’s left-wing political coalition, the New Popular Front, is celebrating after exit polls in the second round of parliamentary elections predicted it was on course for victory. 

France's far-right National Rally had been widely expected to win the election after leading in the first round of voting. 

The snap election was called by a weakened President Macron, in response to a surge in support for the far-right party led by Marine Le Pen.   Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who was appointed by President Macron only seven months ago, has said he is planning to resign. 

France is now heading for a hung parliament with no party expected to achieve an overall majority.  The biggest group in the left-wing alliance is led by the radical socialist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who may now become Prime Minister. 

Reeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Katya Adler and Andrew Harding.

Lyrics
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst,
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing

Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing

Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh

Sweet nothing

Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17ozSeGw-fY

I don’t have much to give 
But I don’t care for gold 
What use is money 
When you need someone to hold? 
Don’t have direction 
I’m just rolling down this road 
Waiting for you to bring me 
In from out the cold

You’ll never know the endless nights 
The rhyming of the rain 
Or how it feels to fall behind 
And watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything 
Don’t you see what I can bring? 
Can’t keep this beating heart at bay 
Set my midnight sorrow free 
I will give you all of me 
Just leave your lover 
Leave him for me

Leave your lover 
Leave him for me

We sit in bars 
And raise our drinks to growing old 
Oh I’m in love with you 
And you will never know 
But if I can’t have you 
I’ll walk this life alone 
Spur you the rising storm 
And let the rivers flow

You’ll never know the endless nights 
The rhyming of the rain 
Or how it feels to fall behind 
And watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything 
Don’t you see what I can bring? 
Can’t keep this beating heart at bay 
Set my midnight sorrow free 
I will give you all of me 
Just leave your lover 
Leave him for me

Leave your lover 
Leave him for me

EKKSTACY - i guess we made it this far (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"EKKSTACY - i guess we made it this far (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

“Come to my shows lol” reads the caption of the blurry photo depicting EKKSTACY crowdsurfing, hands raised in triumph, at one of his club shows a couple years back. As the pop punk revival continues, Gen Zers such as Stacy who not only uphold its core tenets (mosh pits, lyrics about sadness bordering on nihilism, earworm guitar hooks, etc.) but also push it forward are enhancing the genre that gave the previous generation an identity and solace. Judging from photos and fan response, it’s def safe to say that the face-tatted 22-year-old is adept at fostering community at his gigs. In March he’ll traverse clubs across Europe; In May and July he’ll be rocking Stateside. Opportunity abounds. “No one is making music off of just their idea. It’s impossible. I like to be influenced,” says the Vancouver born and raised, LA based singer. He counts Beach House and $uicideboys among current fascinations, but has claimed that he “doesn’t listen” to artists who sound like him. Audiences initially learned about Stacy through 2021’s ‘NEGATIVE’ EP. Its subdued lofi mix gave it propulsion, but made way for his deeply angsty lyrics, so as not to be overwhelming. Fans really connected with the lyrics of “i walk this earth all by myself,” which tackle parental divorce and the terror of independence. While the production choices remain similar on this year’s self-titled debut album, evolution can be found in collaborators (fellow inked up sadboi Trippie Redd and genre hater The Kid LAROI) and subject matter. “Six are about girls, two mention death, and the rest vary,” he told FLOOD. Musing to our DSCVR team about performing he says “it’s the best feeling I think I know.” Time to plug in and let go with EKKSTACY.

Weather disasters over past five decades 'have increased five-fold' - BBC News,"The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organisation.

However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply. 

Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events. But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths.

As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes. 

In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a new atlas from the WMO that charts the scale of these events.

Thousands flee fighting in Syria as rebel forces advance on another key city | BBC News,"Tens of thousands of people are fleeing the Syrian city of Homs as rebel Islamist fighters close in.    The speed at which the armed opposition is advancing across the country has surprised everyone.   The Syrian army of President Assad has been retreating with little sign of resistance. 

Syria’s civil war began in 2011 and led to enormous loss of life - as many as 500,000 people are believed to have been killed.   Rebel fighters were forced into retreat in 2016 but now they're back and in just 10 days they have captured Syria's second largest city of Aleppo and another major city, Hama.  If they also capture Homs they could cut the main road from the capital Damascus to the Syrian coast.

The threat to President Assad’s regime comes as his international allies are weakened, with Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, are fighting in their own conflicts.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Meet Lewis Black as Anger in INSIDE OUT,"Streaming Now on Disney+ – Sign Up at https://disneyplus.com/

No need to get outraged, Lewis Black has got you covered as Anger in Disney/Pixar’s Inside Out, in theatres June 19th.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DtMdRhtlfk

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HFv47QHWJU

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Sometimes in surprising ways, factors such as childhood experiences, housing conditions, poor diets, and healthcare access drive who ends up sick — and who does not. This Forum event, held in connection with a new poll by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR, investigated these factors from the perspective of experts and the U.S. public, as well as examined public perceptions of what impacts health and what actions can be taken to improve health.

Presented March 3, 2015 in Collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR.

Best Korean Street Food in Seoul at Gwangjang Market: She Fed Me! (Day 5),"Read more about Korean street food at Gwangjang Market here ► https://migrationology.com/gwangjang-market-seoul/

One Day 5 of my trip to Seoul, we had an amazing day of eating Korean street food at Gwangjang Market (광장시장), and then had some of the best Korean fried chicken in Seoul.

1:43 Jinjujip (진주집) - After having a few hassles of internet loading in Seoul, I finally got to a good cafe and had some great internet. After that I met up with a good friend of mine and we walked over to Namdaemun Market to eat at a restaurant that specializes in Korean oxtail soup. Although it was pretty expensive, I think as always oxtail soup is in Seoul, it was pretty good. The oxtail was soothing and tender, and tasted especially good with the sauce provided. We ate, kkori Gomtang (oxtail soup) - 21,000 Won ($17.62) and haejangguk - 7000 Won ($5.87).

6:28 Gwangjang Market 광장시장 (Jongno-5, Exit 9 or 8) - One of my favorite things to do in Seoul is go to the wonderful Gwangjang Market (광장시장) to eat Korean street food. If you’re a food food lover, when you’re in Seoul, visiting this market is mandatory. Walking through the traditional Korean market you’ll be amazed at the quantity of food available, each Aunty calling and willing to serve you delicious food. Eventually after walking around a while we just chose a stall and sat down to eat. We chose the right stall. The Aunty serving the food there proceeded to start feeding me, and not just me, but Ying and her sisters as well. I ordered a number of different popular Korean street food dishes including sundae - 7,000 Won ($5.87), blood sausage, mayak gimbap - 4,000 Won ($3.36), what translates to Korean narcotic rice rolls due to their addictive properties, and tteokbokki - 3,000 Won ($2.52), which are the rice cakes in chili pepper sauce. Read my full blog post about Gwangjang Market here: https://migrationology.com/gwangjang-market-seoul/

12:35 Hanchu Fried Chicken (한추) - Sometimes labeled as the best Korean fried chicken in Seoul, this was a place I wasn’t going to miss. So we took the Seoul Metro over to Apujeong Station, Exit 5, and walked for about 10 minutes to get to the beer hall. I ordered a plate of Korean fried chicken, plus fried peppers and a pitcher of beer. The fried chicken was prepared in a batter that included crushed up chilies in it - that’s definitely part of the reason why the chicken was so good. It indeed was some of the best Korean fried chicken I’ve ever had. Thanks to Jeffrey and Dan from http://www.foodiehub.tv/ for the recommendation.

Day 5 was our final full day in Seoul. Stay tuned for more videos from Jeonju (an important food city in South Korea).

Half a million Covid deaths in Brazil as calls grow for President to be impeached - BBC News,"Brazil has now recorded more than half a million coronavirus deaths, making it only the second country, after the US, to pass that figure. 

More than 2,000 people each day have been dying of Covid.

It's led to protests over President Bolsonaro's approach and calls for him to be removed from office.

"If You Ever See This on Your Backyard, Ask for Help to Remove It!","Here is a list of 12 super dangerous fungi and plants that might grow in your backyard. Some of them look like they come straight out of hell, which makes them quite unappealing, so you will unlikely want to touch them. But some of them actually look more than normal or even adorable, and they might be even more dangerous to you and your family. Promise you will not touch any of them! There are some plants that can easily kill you.

TIMESTAMPS
Death Cap
Conocybe filaris
Destroying Angels 
Clathrus Archeri
Devil's Claw
Bloody Tooth
Porcupine Tomato
Fraxinella
Giant Hogweed 
Death Camas
Oleander
Doll's Eye

SUMMARY
- Death Cap is the deadliest of them all. It does not come with a name tag and is easy to confuse with edible straw mushrooms and caesar’s mushrooms. It can be found in different parts of Europe. 
- Conocybe filaris might look cute and innocent but can cause death, or severe pain. If you live in the Pacific Northwest, you have most likely seen it growing in the lawns. 
- Destroying Angels abundantly growing in North America is super toxic and not exactly edible. They belong to the genus Amanita. 
- Clathrus Archeri looks like it was sent from outer space to destroy the humankind, or straight out of hell to remind us to be nice people. In fact, that thing is more than real and terrestrial. 
- Devil’s claws come from Arizona and are even used for basket weaving by Native Americans.
- Bloody Tooth likes to live in the forests and mountains of North America, Europe, Iran, and South Korea. 
- Porcupine Tomato comes from Madagascar but is not even remotely as cute as the lemurs we all love. It can grow 8 feet tall and 8 feet wide in no time.
- Fraxinella, also known as burning bush, dittany, and gas plant thrives in the warm climate of southern Europe, North Africa and most of Asia. 16 to 39 in tall and looking sweet and innocent, it is hiding its killer nature behind the little flowers. 
- Giant Hogweed comes from the Caucasus Mountain region between the Black and Caspian Seas. It came to Europe in the late 19th century, and a few decades later became wide-spread in America, as well. 
- Death Camas might look like a great addition to a summer flower composition. However, if you see them growing in the field or your backyard, do not bring them home.
- The toxins in Oleander are so powerful even honey made by bees that pollinated its flowers can kill or seriously hurt people. Its leaves and sap can irritate and damage your skin. 
- Doll's Eye might have a more terrestrial origin, but one thing is true for sure. The entire plant contains cardiogenic toxins. If you dare to eat them, they will immediately affect your cardiac muscle tissue and very likely kill you.

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Boxing Day 2004 tsunami in Indian Ocean remembered 20 years on | BBC News,"On 26 December 2004, Boxing Day, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake occurred off the coast of northwest Sumatra under the Indian Ocean, unleashing a devastating tsunami.

It killed an estimated 228,000 people across more than a dozen countries and caused massive damage in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and Thailand.

The Andaman and Nicobar islands, located just about 100km north of the epicentre, suffered extensive damage when a wall of water, as high as 15 metres (49 ft) in places, hit land just about 15 minutes later.

Countries across the Indian Ocean have been remembering the catastrophic event 20 years on.

At his daily briefing, Mr Trump said ""there will be death"" in a grim assessment of the days ahead.

He sought to reassure the worst-hit states, promising medical supplies and military personnel to combat the virus.

But in contrast to his warning, Mr Trump suggested easing social-distancing guidelines for Easter.

""We have to open our country again,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Saturday. ""We don't want to be doing this for months and months and months.""

UK announces European ‘coalition of the willing’ to guarantee Ukraine’s security  | BBC News,"The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and to defend it from Russia.

The UK, France and other countries will step up their support for Ukraine in what Mr Starmer called ""a coalition of the willing"" among European nations. 

The British Prime Minister was speaking at the end of a summit of 18 mainly European leaders in London including Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Mr Starmer said: “We are at a crossroads in history today.""

The summit came two days after angry exchanges between the Ukrainian leader and US Donald Trump at the White House, in which Mr Trump urged President Zelensky to enter a peace deal with Russia but declined to commit US forces to provide a security guarantee. 

Mr Starmer said four key points had been agreed at the London summit:  
- to keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia.  
- That any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks. 
- In the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion
- To develop a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards
Sir Keir said: ""We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal... which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength”.   He did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition but said its members would intensify planning now, with real urgency.

TWO SIDES OF ST. LUCIA! 15 Day Repositioning Cruise,"Thanks Windjammer for helping us out! http://www.windjammer-landing.com/ // The beautiful island of St. Lucia is our 65th country and 4th stop on this repositioning cruise from England to Barbados. We had a catamaran tour booked and planned to spend the whole day out in the sunshine circling the island. Unfortunately that plan fell through at the last minute, but instead we had an incredible day hanging out with locals at the market, eating the national dish, and then spending a beautiful afternoon at an all-inclusive resort flying the drone and laying in over-water hammocks! Not a bad plan B :)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YKPagfWuSE

13 Etiquette Mistakes You Should Stop Making By Age 25,"Easy ways to have good manners. Here are 13 tips for good manners and main rules of etiquette for every situation. The rules of etiquette are quite simple and widely known.  It’s never a bad thing to remind ourselves of some of them, especially those we tend to break. 

Unfortunately, many people consider respect for the rules of etiquette as something shameful, considering it a feature of classy aesthetes who are removed from real life. In fact, the basic rules of etiquette are pretty simple. It’s a culture of speech, common courtesy, neat appearance, and control over your emotions.

Who Would Win: You VS. Neanderthal,"Are modern humans the pinnacle of the food chain, the strongest and most intelligent creatures ever to walk this Earth? Maybe now, but once upon a time, we had some real competition: Neanderthals. 

Wait, like, cave people? Weren’t Neanderthals our ancestors? Nope! We came from the Cro-Magnon, which were early modern humans. Neanderthals were a separate branch of humans. Their DNA is even different from ours, so we can safely say that Neanderthals were a completely different species.

SUMMARY:
- The average Neanderthal was about 5’4” and weighed around 160 pounds. Neanderthals might’ve been smaller than modern humans, but they made up for it in stoutness.
- But modern humans have more complex and efficient brains. 
- On his thick muscular legs, a Neanderthal could easily trek 30 miles just to find some dinner.
- Modern humans might be smarter, but Neanderthals would win any arm-wrestling match. They were anywhere from 5-20% stronger than modern humans. 
- Neanderthals had an average lifespan of only about 40 years. They grew up a lot faster than we do – for Neanderthals, you were an adult at 12!
- It's possible that Neanderthals could’ve been ruined by a very bad diet consisting of only meat. These tough guys hunted big game – they weren’t too interested in fruits, vegetables, or nuts.
- But when severe frosts came, the population of deer, mammoths, bison, and other goodies began to decline significantly. 
- Due to this sharp global cooling, Neanderthals couldn't cross a lot of distances, so they were forced to coexist with the Cro-Magnons who migrated from Africa. 
- Neanderthals might’ve been physically superior to those early modern humans, but the Cro-Magnons were taller, more agile, and, most importantly, more cunning.
- Studies of Neanderthal skulls showed that they had a much larger brain than Cro-Magnon.
- The reason for the Neanderthals extinction could be... Neanderthals themselves. Every male risked his life daily fighting with bears, rhinos, mammoths and other ancient beasts. 
- Because of this hardcore lifestyle, the number of men likely decreased, so the birthrate fell.

Back to normality in South Africa as Covid cases fall - BBC News,"The Omicron variant of Covid-19, first discovered in South Africa, eight weeks ago, appears to be fading and life in South Africa is returning to normal. 

The scientific consensus in South Africa is that while Omicron is very contagious the death toll has been much smaller than in past waves of Covid. 

Some of South Africa’s scientists are speaking out, accusing richer nations of being quick to believe bad news about Covid but questioning good news about the virus coming from South Africa.

MADAGASCAR, AFRICA - In this video today we’re in Morondava, a town in Madagascar that’s known for their Giant Baobab trees. Today we’ll be visiting the market, eating huge local seafood on the beach, and visiting the world famous Avenue of the Baobabs! 

Street Food Breakfast - We’re starting at the bustling morning market right in the heart of Morondava. At the market you’ll find an entire food court with all sorts of Malagasy food including rice porridge, and proteins for breakfast. We also had coffee, kettle cakes, baobab fruits, and coconuts! 

Seafood Beach BBQ - Morondava is located on the West Coast of Madagascar, and there’s plenty of local seafood. So we headed to a local beach for a big bbq of fish, octopus, and freshwater river prawns from the nearby river. 

Avenue of the Baobabs - When you think about Madagascar, probably the first image that comes to mind are the iconic Giant Baobab trees at the Avenue of the Baobabs. They are hundreds of years old, and are some of the most breathtaking trees you’ll ever see! 

Goat BBQ - The area around Morondava and the baobabs is known for their goats, and we were treated to an unforgettable goat roast bbq, as fresh as you can get.

Trigonometry on Khan Academy: Big, fancy word, right? Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (""trig"" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question. Maybe you'll learn the answer from us in these tutorials!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

Strandz - An Idea Was Born (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024,"Strandz - An Idea Was Born | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024

You definitely have to be music oriented if you’re trying to get a studio job at the age of 14. Then an eighth-grader who grew up in Germany and Nigeria before his fam settled in South London, Strandz’s priority wasn’t learning the particulars of recording equipment (although that’s a boon in these tech-savvy times). It was to shake a few hands and extend the number of names on his contact list - you know, to get in the game. That he did, and caught the fever along the way. Without any previous music skills, he learned to play the piano for his audition at the famed BRIT School, which was nearby his house in Croydon. He made the cut, and the education did what education does: broadens interests. After opting for a couple gap years from uni to concentrate on creative skill sets, and by 2017 and the arrival of “Paper,” things started rolling. Early tracks such as “A-List” and “Carla” hit in the spring of 2020. With a yen for ‘90s hip-hop and a love of Jhené Aiko and Feist, the young artist wanted to make a point of crafting music that was emotionally open. As it developed, it was marked by a vocal style that was both familiar and unique. Complex has said that Strandz’s “flow is anything but a throwback, opting for a slow-and-low delivery that fits well with that era of hip-hop while being right-up-the-minute new.” Dodging the dominance of drill is a tough assignment for a UK rapper in 2023, but last year’s “4 The Money” knows its way around funk, and this past February’s “Us Against the World,” a TikTok hit that put this fan of Fela and 50 Cent on a lot of party playlists, rides a Smokey Robinson & the Miracles sample. Yep, heads are usually noddin’ when it blasts from the box. With live instrumentalists and singers in mind, Strandz has said that the upcoming months are ones that will be about “breaking boundaries and trying crazy stuff.” We’re here to support that vision, regardless how it might shift. These performances of “An Idea Was Born” and “Us Against The World” have us hooked forever.

The evolution of surfing - BBC News,"A new book tracks down the visual history of surfing from its first recording in 1778, to today's global phenomenon. Cultural anthropologist Jim Heimann, editor of 'Surfing', has brought together 900 images that chart its evolution on and off the water, as a sport, a lifestyle and a philosophy. He spoke to Dan Damon about the role that photography played in capturing the images and the spirit of surfing.

DR Congo rebels reportedly capture most of Goma | BBC News,"Rebels have reportedly taken over much of the key city of Goma in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, following three days of intense fighting between M23 rebels and the army and its allies.
 
Rwanda has been accused of backing the Tutsi-led M23 rebel group in recent months, but the neighbouring country has denied giving the rebels any direct military support.
 
Kenyan leader William Ruto had invited DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to a virtual summit aimed at ending the fighting, later on Wednesday.
 
But state media said Tshisekedi will not take part in the regionally brokered talks.
 
Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said Rwanda would take part in the summit, but did not say whether Kagame would attend.

FUNNY THINGS ONLY GIRLS UNDERSTAND || Clever Life Hacks For Girls And Relatable Couple Situations,"Hilarious couple moments and relatable situations most of us have been through 

Girls tend to be a bit harder on themselves than guys, and truth be told, we all struggle with our appearance. Those who have curly hair want straight hair, and those with straight want curly hair. We’ll also scroll through social media and look at people who seem to have beautiful features, but deep down, we’re all insecure about different things on both our face and body. 

Some girls who have extra weight always struggle to lose it, and the underweight girls always try to put on weight but can’t. At the end of the day, everyone is beautiful the way they are, and even though insecurities are inevitable, it’s OK not to be too harsh on yourself. Others see you better than you see yourself. 

Another thing I wanted to show is some relationship/couple situations. Living with your partner comes with perks, and having your own rituals and funny moments bring you closer together. Like when you fight on who goes first to the toilet, or when you have a nice pampering night routine with sheet masks. Or, when one person is at work and the other face-times you from the shower. 
Watch the entire video to see some funny moments you can relate to.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and a co-founder of several other companies.

Inside Out US Teaser Trailer,"Streaming Now on Disney+ – Sign Up at https://disneyplus.com/

Inside Out comes to US theatres in 3D on June 19, 2015. 

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t0A_tZGrYw

"Trailblazers: ""I use my scars and pain to help others"" - BBC News","Svetlana Alekseeva used to be called names like ""Freddy Krueger"" and ""Frankenstein"" because of the burns that covered her body.

She grew up in a remote Russian town with an alcoholic mother. One day her mum was out drinking and Sveta got caught in a fire that burned nearly half her body.
When she turned 18, she chose the nickname ""Charcoal"" and moved to Moscow. She now has an Instagram account - https://www.instagram.com/o2her/ - where she posts photos of her scars to help others feel positive about their bodies.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Netanyahu:  bomb attacks on Yemen are “just the beginning” | BBC News,"Israel has carried out a series of airstrikes in Yemen, hitting targets including the international  airport in the capital, Sanaa, where people ran for cover.  

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the raids were part of a campaign of retaliation - which was only just starting - for recent strikes on Israel by Yemen's Houthi fighters, who are backed  by Iran. 
  
It's reported that at least two people were killed at the international airport.   The port of Hudayda was also hit - along with other sites described by Israel as ""military targets"".

New UK test to find eye cancer in unborn babies set for roll out - BBC News,"A new test that can detect unborn babies for a rare form of eye cancer is set to be rolled out across the health service in the UK.

It can identify genetic mutations linked to retinoblastoma, a type of cancer which usually affects children under five and if left untreated can lead to sight loss and death.

The tests will be offered to pregnant women with a family history of the disease and are able to predict with almost 100% accuracy whether the baby would develop this cancer - and even whether the disease might develop in their siblings.

NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the test had the potential to save hundreds of lives.

Lyrics:
Why You ever chose me
Has always been a mystery
All my life I’ve been told I belong at the end of the line
With all the other Not-Quites
With all the Never-Get-It-Rights
But it turns out we’re the ones You’ve been looking for all this time

 ‘Cause I’m just a nobody
Trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody who saved my soul
Ever since You rescued me
You gave my heart a song to sing
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus

Moses had stage fright
And David brought a rock to a sword fight
You picked 12 outsiders nobody would’ve chosen
And You changed the world
Well, the moral of the story is
Everybody’s got a purpose
So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
“Who do you think you are”
I say…

I’m just a nobody
Trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody who saved my soul
Ever since You rescued me
You gave my heart a song to sing
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus

So let me go down down down in history
As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
And if they all forget my name, well, that’s fine with me
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus

So let me go down down down in history
As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
And if they all forget my name, well, that’s fine with me
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus

‘Cause I’m just a nobody
Trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody who saved my soul
Ever since You rescued me
You gave my heart a song to sing
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus
I’m living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus

►Mexico City street food guide: https://goo.gl/Crr2Uv

I met up with 5 Mexican Guys (https://goo.gl/ankJN3, and they just started their channel since I met them, so go check them out!) to go on an ultimate Mexican street food tour of Mexico City. It was one of the greatest food days I had in Mexico, and we tasted so many incredible dishes.

La Esquina del Chilaquil - For breakfast in La Condesa, there’s no better place to check out than La Esquina del Chilaquil, their tortas are delicious.
Price - 40 MXN ($2.14) each

Mercado de San Juan - I wanted to quickly check out this market, but it wasn’t all that busy when we went - there wasn’t too much going on. So we had a quick scorpion and then continued on to the ultimate street food market.
Scorpion - 160 MXN ($8.54) for 4

Mercado de La Merced - Mexico City is packed with street food, but if you want a food experience that’s busy, in your face, and always exciting and delicious, Mercado de la Merced is one of the greatest places to start. You’ll encounter massive amounts of street food that will blow your mind with how delicious they are. Here are the things we ate at the market:
Quesadilla - 57 MXN ($3.04) for 3
Fries tacos - 20 MXN ($1.07) each
Pancita - 40 MXN ($2.14) per bowl 
Pambazo
Mamey - 15 MXN ($0.80)
Mango - 15 MXN ($0.80)

Churrería El Moro - This wasn’t street food, but we needed a little afternoon break, and there’s no better spot in Mexico City for churros than Churrería El Moro.
Total price - 439 MXN ($23.44) for all

Esquites - 20 MXN ($1.07) - After walking around El Zocalo - the center of Mexico City, we then had a corn snack os esquites where they add corn, mayo, cheese, and chili salsas to a cup. It’s pretty tasty.

Loncheria La Rambla - Next we tried a Mexican style turkey sandwich - it was alright, but not the best food of the day.
Torta de pavo - 35 MXN ($1.87) each

Taquería Los Cocuyos - And finally to end this Mexico City street food tour with 5 Mexican Guys, we headed to Taquería Los Cocuyos, a legendary taco stall in the heart of the center of the city. The tacos are amazing, and it was the perfect was to end this day of incredible Mexican food.
Tacos de cabeza - 17 MXN ($0.91) each

Again, thank you to Moises and 5 Mexican Guys for reaching out! Check them out here: https://goo.gl/ankJN3

Iraqi Surgeon Looks Back on 17 Years of Treating War-Wounded Patients,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) surgeon Dr. Rasheed Fakhri fled his country during the Iraq War. For the last 17 years, he has been working at MSF's reconstructive surgery project in Amman, Jordan, treating people from Iraq who have been impacted by the war.

“I lived through 17 years of stories,"" says Dr. Fakhri. ""Stories that range from children scarred by terrorism to innocent victims of bombings, and those who lost their ability to speak or lost their sight. But thankfully we’ve helped them on their path to recovery. This is a source of pride for us.”

Ukraine stops transit of Russian gas to EU | BBC News,"A decades-long arrangement allowing Russian gas to flow to EU states via Ukraine has ended after a five-year deal expired.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not allow Russia to ""earn additional billions on our blood"" and had given the EU a year to prepare.
 
Russia can still send gas to Hungary, Turkey and Serbia through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.
 
The European Commission said the continent's gas system was ""resilient and flexible"" and that it could cope with the change. Slovakia, however, could face disruption and Moldova, which is not in the EU, is already suffering shortages.

Thai Jungle Curry แกงป่า (Kaeng Pa),"Do you love Thai food? Get a copy of my Thai Food Guide by clicking here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/

Thailand has a countless amount of healthy and wonderfully tasty dishes, one of them being a famous Northern Thai jungle curry (Kaeng Pa แกงป่า). Nearly every flavor you could possibly dream of in a single bite is present within a spoonful of jungle curry. Originally a curry from Northern Thailand, kaneg pa แกงป่า is a medley of vegetables and herbs that can be grown and harvested from the forest. It was once normally cooked with wild boar, which was formerly common in the area, and while you can still order this version, other variations with chicken or pork are also widespread. To try something new, I decided to order this Thai jungle curry with frog - known as Kaeng Pa Kob (แกงป่ากบ). The soup curry included a vibrant mixture of bamboo shoots, eggplants, long beans, chillies, roots, herbs, basil, and not forgetting the meaty chunks of frog included in the soup. The great thing about Thai jungle curry is that it's very healthy and includes not coconut milk like many other Thai curries. The flavors will excited your mouth like crazy!

In order to get a taste of Thai jungle curry แกงป่า in Bangkok, there's no better place to go than a restaurant by the name of Ran Gaeng Pa Sriyan (ร้านแกงป่า ศรีย่าน). Located near the Sri Yang market in the Dusit district of Bangkok, Thailand, they serve some of the best jungle curry in the city. Everyday for both lunch and dinner, the restaurants attracts a crowd of local Thais all out to score some marvelous cuisine. Along with jungle curry, the menu also includes an extensive mix of other delicious Thai dishes, some of them northern Thai specialities. I ordered a plate of minced quail stir fried with chillies, garlic, and basil (Nok Sab Pad Kee Mao นกสับผัดขี้เมา) which was outstanding. Also, the stir fried bitter river snails with chillies and garlic (Hoy Comb Pad Cha หอยขมผัดฉ่า) was equally good. I have a raging addiction to eating and ordering stink beans, so there was no resisting a plate of stink beans stir fried with fermented shrimp paste known as Goong Pad Kapi Sataw (กุ้งผัดกะปิสะตอ). All dishes were unbelievably good and it was one of the most memorable feasts of the month.

To finish of a super tasty meal, I ended with a soothing bowl of durian ice cream over a small bed of sticky rice. It was good, but not as good as the durian ice cream down the street - that's why I didn't show it in this video. So when you come to Bangkok and want to sample the best Thai jungle curry แกงป่า, this is by far the best one I've ever had. And by the way, you don't need to order it with frog if you don't want to, there are many other options you can choose from!

Sam Tompkins - See Me ((Live) | Vevo DSCVR),"Sam Tompkins - See Me (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

“I hate myself/but I do it in private,” divulges Sam Tompkins in the chorus of “See Me.” On the surface, this line is a bit ironic. There’s nothing private about more than 500k Insta followers and 2 million monthly Spotify listeners. Especially when all those ears are tuning in for Sam’s totally raw self-investigations. But if you really think about it, this line is about a Past Sam; On Stage Sam is the triumphant version. It makes sense that the 26-year-old Brit is a devotee to Don McClean, a legendary songwriter who welded melancholy and pop together using an acoustic guitar as his blowtorch. In 2021, Tompkins’ cover of a Bruno Mars ballad was sampled by Jar Choi for “To the Moon,” a clip of which became so ubiquitous on TikTok in 2021 that listening to the song by itself feels kinda weird. The blueprint for how artists are supposed to capitalize on such newfangled internet clout remains a mystery; but impressively Sam did it. He’s trickled out a handful of singles of varying energy. “Lose It All” waxes plaintive about the “nightmare” regrets of not expressing feelings. Follow up track “Die For Someone” rides a kick-snare 80s beat that recalls Post Malone’s pop efforts. These DSCVR sessions really show off the power of his voice, which he molds after two Justins: Bieber and Timberlake. Get ready to get in your feels.

Drought conditions in northern Kenya, much of Somalia and southern Ethiopia are predicted to persist until at least mid-2022, putting lives at risk.

The situation is already so bad that wild animals are dying in their hundreds and herders are reporting losses of up to 70% of their livestock.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Kolkata Street Food - AMAZING Indian Vegetarian Meal on Decker's Lane!,"Check out my Indian street food guide to Kolkata street food on my blog: https://migrationology.com/kolkata-street-food-guide-calcutta/

When I visited India, I went with a main intention to eat, of course. And as soon as I flew into Kolkata, I knew that I was in Indian street food heaven. Kolkata is a giant city, India's third largest, and while it's chaotic and busy in every way imaginable, this makes for an environment where street food is everywhere to be seen.

After doing a little research, I decided to go to a street in Kolkata that's now known as James Hickey Sarani, but is better known by its former name of Deckers Lane. Mention Deckers Lane to most locals in Kolkata, and the most delicious selection of Indian street food will come to their minds. And that is exactly where I wanted to be, and where I found some truly wonderful Indian food in a very nice environment. The street is best during the lunchtime hour when many folks are out on their lunch breaks and hungry. Deckers Lane fills up with people devour plates of food, walking up and down, sipping on clay cups of chai, and motorcycles honking while passing by.

Having not a clue where to eat first, I settled upon a masala dosa stall and that's what I ate (video later). But that was just warm up. After the masala dosa I couldn't help myself from going to the stall that was receiving the most continual flow of customer - there was one stall where there was a huge crowd huddled around eating and waiting for their food and it looked the best. So that's exactly where I went. I got in line, a line that didn't really exist, and finally had the chance to talk to the guy taking order. I first got rice and then under his recommendation had the potato curry, some mixed vegetable curry, and a few pieces of tandoori roti to top things off. I was incredibly excited to start digging into my Kolkata street food feast. The meal was food influenced from north India, rather than local Bengali dishes. It was rich and creamy, and the curries were strong and absolutely flavorful. Using the rice and tandoori roti, I was able to scrape up everything and fully enjoyed every single bite of this meal along Deckers Lane in Kolkata.

The men eating at this street food stall along with me, were all pretty friendly too, particularly the man in the purple sweater who gave me some good tips and named the dishes I ate as he was eating too. You can just see the passion and intense love of the food he has on his face too! So anyway, this was one of my first meals in India, and it proved to be an absolutely delicious meal that I would eat over and over again if I lived in Kolkata. The entire Kolkata street food meal cost me 40 Indian Rupees, which is about $0.72, a pretty decent steal in my opinion!

Tasha Cobbs Leonard - Burdens Down (Live Performance) | Vevo,"Tasha Cobbs Leonard - Burdens Down. An exclusive live performance for Vevo. 

Music has power, right? It can lift you up, it can throw you down, it can heal wounds. And sometimes it can deliver a deep enough sense of hope to even do a little lifesaving. You'll feel that power front and center when Tasha Cobbs Leonard lets it rip on ""Burdens Down,"" one of two songs the gospel lightning rod performed in our Brooklyn studio. She and her squad of musicians – instrumentalists and choir – generated an intense blast of that power, raising the roof with “Burdens” and then revealing the depth of their grace with “The Church I Grew Up In.” The 41-year-old Georgia native is a virtuoso vocalist who delivers her prayers in song – one of faith-based music’s preeminent voices, an artist whose work has earned GRAMMYs, Billboard Music Awards, and Dove Awards. From her 2010 debut, ‘Smile’ to last year’s live album ‘Hymns,’ she shared her beliefs with an ever-growing audience, listeners who are swept away with the dignity and humility of her performances. This recent Vevo visit contains both of those elements. Jump in and watch Leonard put passion front and center, and check the new '10 Years of Tasha' compilation. It's a great place to catch up on her rather incredible career trajectory.

Hong Kong man guilty in first national security law trial - BBC News,"The first person to be charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law has been found guilty in a landmark ruling.

Tong Ying-kit was convicted of inciting secession and terrorism after riding a motorbike into police and flying a flag calling for Hong Kong's ""liberation"". 

More than 100 people have been arrested under the law since it came into force in 2019.

Beijing insists that the widely criticised law, which was introduced after a series of mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, is needed to bring stability to the city.

Inhaler - When It Breaks (VEVO DSCVR Live Session),"Pre-order Inhaler's new album 'Cuts And Bruises' now: https://inhaler.lnk.to/CutsandBruises

Inhaler - When It Breaks. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Look around, the early '90s are back. Baggy clothes. Heavy eyeliner. A new Bill and Ted flick. And a blast of solid alt-rock coming out of Ireland. Founded a few years ago by four Dublin mates, Inhaler has emerged from the crowded shamrock scene, and their tunes pack a heavyweight punch. Jabbing bass guitar, some vicious snare smacks and Eli Hewson's keening vocal drives “My Honest Face,"" and the anthemic gallop of “When It Breaks” will certainly find its way onto road trip playlists. Last year, Sir Elton John called them “f**king amazing.” That was around the time of a European tour that had new fans quickly addicted to their “sweaty” live shows. Jumpin’ at the opp to play again, the lads hit our DSCVR studio in London. They roared through “When It Breaks” and “It Won’t Always Be Like This,” channeling months worth of built-up energy into the set. Hit play and get blown away.

Artemis I Path to the Pad: The Spacecraft,"Named after one of the largest constellations in the night sky, Orion is the name given to the spacecraft that will carry the first woman and first person of color to the Moon. But before we fly astronauts aboard, the spacecraft, powered by our Space Launch System rocket, will travel tens of thousands of miles on a flight test around the Moon. Watch as teams at NASA's Kennedy Space Center prepare Orion for that journey, outfitting the spacecraft with its necessary components as it moves along its path to the pad.

Lauren Sanderson - Electric (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Lauren Sanderson - Electric - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

If the medium is the message then Lauren Sanderson decided her dispatches as a motivational speaker need a beat behind them. So the Indiana native put her personal revelations to song, and in 2016 released the independent EP, ‘Center of Expression.’ Her pivot from YouTube personality to pop singer was well received. Sanderson soon found her herself signed to Epic Records and relocating to Los Angeles. The former DIY act recharged and this year pushed out her six-song EP, ‘DON’T PANIC!’ With a smattering of influences ranging from ska to hip-hop, dance to pop, the set is an impressive re-introduction. Here, she brings her live-wire energy to DSCVR ATW with a blast of in-your-face music on “Electric” and “Shut Em Up.”

Julian Assange: Wikileaks founder extradition to US blocked by UK judge - BBC News,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled.

The judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US.

The 49-year-old is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011.

The US claims the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. Mr Assange has fought the extradition and says the case is politically motivated.

The US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. This means Mr Assange is not likely to be freed from London's Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - immediately.

"If You See This While Swimming, Get Out Of the Water Right Away!","How to Stay Safe While Swimming. Swimming is a great way to stay fit and healthy, plus it’s quite relaxing, no wonder so many people enjoy it. But most people would never dream that some encounters with ocean inhabitants can turn out to be fatal. You should know that even the prettiest and smallest creatures dwelling in the seas and oceans can seriously harm you. And while some of them leave you hurting from nasty bites, others can kill you outright. In this video, you'll get acquainted with the 10 deadliest water inhabitants.

Lionfish 3:16
Flower Urchin 4:08
Indonesian Needlefish 5:12
Electric Eel 6:05

SUMMARY
-Stingrays live in tropical and subtropical waters that are shallow and warm. There have been cases where people died after an unfortunate encounter with this fish.
-Lionfish can be spotted in both the South Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. They have numerous needle-sharp pelvic, dorsal, and anal fins - which all contain venom.
-Urchins have venom in their triangular-shaped arms. That venom causes convulsions, spasms of the smooth muscle, paralysis, shock, and death.
-Indonesian needlefish resemble daggers and swim near the surface of the water. Their long sharp jaws turn needlefish into 3-ft-long spears. There have been cases where people happened to be in the way of these creatures.
-Electric eels live in the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. These unusual fish can deliver a huge 600-volt electrical discharge. Such a voltage can easily result in heart failure in humans.
-Barracudas live in tropical waters, deep oceans, along continental shelves, or close to coral reefs. They aren't venomous, but the real danger is their scary sharp teeth.
-Blue-ringed octopuses live in coral reefs and tide pools in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The most dangerous thing about the bite of the blue-ringed octopus is that it’s practically painless. Victims start to suspect that something is wrong only when they start to suffocate and become paralyzed.
-Reef stonefish are the most venomous fish on our planet. It's super easy to step on this fish. Stonefish have a row of spines along their back. If they feel threatened, they extend these spines and use them to deliver their venom.
-The textile cone snail is at the top of the list of the most dangerous creatures in the world. One drop of the venom this snail produces can kill 20 people.
-Box jellyfish are hunters. They can easily latch onto people by wrapping their slender tentacles around a person's limb or body. Since 1954, there have been almost 5,600 recorded deaths from box jellyfish attacks.

Johnson sticks his foot on a table during a joke with the French president - BBC News,"A photo of Boris Johnson sticking his foot on a table during talks in Paris with the French president triggered unflattering comments on social media.

But users on both sides of the Channel who called the UK prime minister's actions insulting might have been jumping to conclusions.

A video appears to show Mr Johnson was responding to a joke by his host.

Emmanuel Macron seems to suggest the table could also be used as a footstool before Mr Johnson lifts his right boot.

Health System “about to fail” in Gaza,"With the siege of Gaza cutting off access to essential resources like medication, medical equipment, electricity, and fuel, it will soon become largely impossible to provide medical care. The needs are enormous and growing.
 
“Now we have more than 3,000 wounded patients,” said Dr. Nedal Abed, an orthopedic surgeon with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), at Al Shifa hospital, which has a 700-bed capacity. “We have very limited medical equipment. Of course, no electricity is available. It is unknown how much gasoline is left [to run the generators]. It’s a matter of time.”
 
The Israeli military has ordered an evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip, but patients being treated in hospitals have nowhere to go. This evacuation order is a death sentence for the gravely sick and injured.

28 EASY CLOTHING HACKS THAT WON'T COST YOU A PENNY,"UNBELIEVABLE CLOTHING HACKS AND DIY’s YOU SHOULD TRY ON YOUR CLOTHES

Today, I show you how to give yourself a new style and fashionable look without spending any money. The only thing you have to do is alter your old clothes a bit into something new. 
Jean jackets are gorgeous during the summer, and if you have a long one, you can cut it to a very short jacket and wear it out for coffee.
But I got another great jeans-hack. You can decorate your jacket using some fabric dye and a cut-out stencil of your favorite design. You add the stencil on your jacket and use a sponge, you tap it in. 
Patterned skirts are no longer in style, but patterned crop tops are. So, you can wear your skirt as a cute crop top, and you can cut a long stripe from the bottom of it to give your top some romantic sleeves. 
Another great way to decorate your clothes is with bleach. You can take an old pair of jeans and some Q-tips, dip the Q-tips in some bleach and after that, press them on your jeans – when they dry, they’ll look like lighter-colored dots.

Hong Kong's hospitals overwhelmed amid spike in Covid cases - BBC News,"Hong Kong's healthcare system has been overwhelmed by a huge surge in Covid-19 cases, with infected patients being treated outside crowded hospitals.

The government has admitted it is struggling to contain the fifth wave of infections, fuelled by Omicron. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the local leaders to take ""all necessary measures"", in a rare intervention.

The comments may signal tighter controls in China's special administrative region, which pursues a zero Covid policy - but without the strict mass testing and lockdowns seen in mainland China.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

US dog shelters struggle with returns after pandemic adoption boom - BBC News,"Shelters across the US are struggling to take in a growing number of dogs and cats. 

Some pets adopted early in the pandemic are being sent back as owners slowly return to normal life. 

The financial impact of Covid-19 as well as a puppy boom due to a pause in spaying and neutering during the pandemic are also adding to the strain.

""It is so hard for the animals,"" says an employee of Lucky Dog Rescue, a Virginia-based non-profit that matches shelter dogs with temporary homes.

"If You Eat an Avocado a Day For a Month, Here's What Will Happen to You","What Will Happen to Your Body If You Eat Avocado Every Day. The avocado is a unique fruit with multiple nutritional and health benefits. How would your body respond if you ate just one avocado a day? In fact, it would transform your life as you’d get amazing results: your breath will be fresh at all times, your kidneys and liver will work more efficiently, your blood pressure will become lower, just to name a few. 
There's a miraculous mineral to be found in avocados: potassium. It helps your system keep a healthy fluid balance through chemical channels for cells and organs. Avocados are also a great source of vitamins C and E. Vitamin C is known for its involvement in the creation of collagen and elastin, which help to maintain the skin's elasticity and firmness. Vitamin E takes it to a whole new level, reducing the damage of excessive sun exposure and counteracting aging.

SUMMARY
-Avocado has antibacterial and antioxidant flavonoids, which kill bacteria in your mouth and make your breath fresh.
-Potassium helps your system keep a healthy fluid balance through chemical channels for cells and organs. A good fluid balance allows your kidneys to function better.
-Eating avocados regularly lowers the “bad” LDL cholesterol and blood triglycerides by up to 22% and increases the “good” HDL cholesterol by up to 11%.
-This fruit is actually one of the best products for a liver-friendly diet, and that's all thanks to its ability to help your body produce glutathione! The liver desperately craves this antioxidant to filter out harmful substances and protect its cells from damage.
-Potassium in avocados helps regulate the fluid balance benefits your blood pressure too. In this case, potassium prevents osteoporosis and, most importantly, lowers your blood pressure.
-Avocados are high in antioxidants, especially carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin, which protect our eyes against harmful blue light.
-The ability of avocados to give that extra bit of protection from cancer comes from the carotenoids and monounsaturated fat they contain, both of which make their own contribution to the impressive reduction of cancer.
-Avocados are rich in fiber, which is essential for making those unwanted pounds disappear. Fiber is incredibly filling and digests slowly.
-Thanks to vitamins C and E avocados help to maintain the skin's elasticity and firmness. Avocados are also rich in omega-9 fatty acids, and they’re crucial for maintaining moisture in the epidermis and regenerating epidermal cells.

Japan's emperor abdicates the throne - BBC News,"Japan's Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign.
The 85-year-old was given permission to abdicate after saying he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health.
He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years.
Akihito will technically remain emperor until midnight.
His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will ascend the throne later on Wednesday. A new era - called Reiwa, meaning order and harmony - will begin in Japan's unique calendar.

Sal determines the domain of a function that models the height of a plant over time.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Lyrics:

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwViQxSJJQ

MSF is Responding to the Earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,"Following the powerful earthquakes that hit southern Turkey and northwestern Syria on February 6, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams working in northwestern Syria have mobilized with local partners to respond to the increasing needs in the area. The United Nations has confirmed that more than 9,000 people were wounded and 2,300 were killed, according to the first estimates from both countries.

Sadly, an MSF staff member was found dead under the rubble of his house in Idlib, and others lost members of their family.

MSF provided immediate support to 23 health facilities across Idlib and Aleppo governorates by donating emergency medical kits and supporting them with medical staff to reinforce their teams. MSF teams have donated blankets and essential life kits to displaced people in the region. The earthquakes destroyed hundreds of houses, leaving thousands homeless. People are staying outside despite the snow due to fear of aftershocks that have continued throughout the day.

Belarus unrest: Lukashenko steps up efforts to reassert control - BBC News,"After a three-hour video conference, EU Leaders agreed unanimously to take three actions over Belarus:

Firstly, to impose sanctions including asset freezes for an as yet undisclosed number of officials involved in alleged election-rigging, brutality and imprisonment of protesters. The exact sanctions are still being worked out
Secondly, leaders agreed to a joint form of words making clear that the EU stands with the people on the streets, and does not recognise the result. But it does not go as far as stating they do not recognise President Lukashenko's authority, as some EU officials wanted
Thirdly, leaders offered help in trying to mediate dialogue between the government and the opposition, to find a way for the president to stand down and peacefully transfer power.
In addition, €53m (£48m; $63m) of financial support from the EU to Belarus is being re-assigned away from the state to non-governmental organisations, with some money assigned to help the victims of violence, as well setting up alternatives to government-backed media organisations.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said election had been neither free nor fair.

SUMMARY:
- The world's fastest roller-coaster is in the Ferrari World theme park in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The thing takes just 5 seconds to reach its top speed of 150 mph. 
- Venezuela’s Jeison Orlando Rodríguez Hernández has the largest shoe size today. He wears an unimaginable U.S. size 26. 
- The world's tiniest house was built by nanorobotics researchers in France. The itsy-bitsy construction is so small that it wouldn't even fit a mite! 
- Porcelain Palace, the largest public restroom in the world, is in Chongqing, China. It's not a single bathroom, but a gigantic 4-story, 32,000-sq-ft complex with 1,000 toilets! 
- The fastest train in the world is Shanghai Maglev. It runs along a high-speed magnetic levitation line at a max speed of 268 mph! 
- The smallest living dog is Milly, a Chihuahua from Dorado, Puerto Rico. When the tiny thing was born, she didn't even weigh 1 ounce and could fit in a teaspoon!
- The Central-Mid-Levels escalator is 2,600 ft long and goes just one way at a time depending on rush hour. 
- The world's quietest place is a room in a Microsoft research lab in Redmond, Washington state. It’s so eerily quiet that nobody can stay there for more than 45 minutes at a time. 
- The ""world's littlest skyscraper"" is the Newby-McMahon Building in Wichita Falls, Texas. It’s just 40 ft tall.
- The tallest bridge in the world is the Millau Viaduct in Southern France. Its maximum point soars at 1,125 ft above the ground, which is  -- really high  for a bridge. 
- The biggest school in the world is in Lucknow, India. It's the City Montessori School, where you’ll find almost 40,000 students and well over 2,000 teachers!
- The largest plant in the world grows in The Sequoia National Park in California. It’s a tree nicknamed ""General Sherman,"" and the giant is 271 ft tall, almost as tall as Lady Liberty.
- The Earth's slowest animal is the three-toed sloth. Its maximum speed is 15 ft per hour! 
- Venezuelan-born stunt performer Ernesto Gainza Medina used the smallest parachute in the world for his 2014 jump in Dubai. His parachute's canopy was just 35 sq ft.
- The largest published book is ""The Little Prince."" This record-breaking edition is almost 7 ft tall and over 10 ft wide when open!

India Drought: A lack of water and wives - BBC News,"""Who would give their daughter to this village?"" That's the question posed by one man in an Indian village devastated by an ongoing drought in the country. The majority of young men in Gopipur, in the Chitrakoot district about 400 miles south of New Delhi, say that the shortage of water, and its crippling impact on the local economy, has made it harder for them to get married. It's one of the unexpected social consequences of a drought that the Indian government now says is affecting at least 330 million Indians. BBC Pop Up went to the community where nearly 5,000 people rely on a small naturally-fed well for drinking and bathing water.

BBC Pop Up went to India's Chitrakoot district, where nearly 5,000 people walk miles each day to a small naturally-fed well for drinking and bathing water. BBC Pop Up visited the village of Gopipur to learn more about the daily struggles of living away from water.

Nebu Kiniza - Pressure (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Nebu Kiniza - Pressure - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

Nebu Kiniza put the pedal to the metal with his 2016 breakout hit, “Gassed Up,” and the atmospheric track made a sizable dent, powering its way past 150 million streams on Spotify. The Queens-reared, Atlanta-residing rapper has been on the grind for years, with a number of notable mixtapes under his belt, including ‘The Honor Roller.’ Along the way he’s also nabbed collabs with Lil Yachty and opened up tour dates for Big Baby D.R.A.M. This year, however, saw him release his proper debut, ‘From Me 2 U’ - a refined take on his earlier work. Complete with billowy choruses and pensive rhymes, Nebu Kiniza is finally announcing his arrival. Get familiar with his DSCVR ATW performances, “All In” and “Pressure.”

FILM DESCRIPTION: 
Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. She's math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she's prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar® nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. But when she breaks her mom's #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award® winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There's one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school's beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt's Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most.

Ultimate PAKISTANI STREET FOOD Tour in Dubai!! 16 Hours Eating Biryani + Balloon-Sized Puris!!,"Best Pakistani food in Dubai! Go check out @thefoodranger  and @Alinhamdani!!
📺 Dubai Emirati food tour: https://youtu.be/W6W1vxdH9IE

DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - Welcome to Dubai, which is one of the most diverse cities in the world with an amazing array of delicious and authentic food. Today we’re going on an ultimate 16 hours Pakistani street food tour in Dubai and Sharjah!

Again be sure to follow Trevor and Ali on their youtube channels and social media.

Ok, let’s get started eating, here are all the places: 

1. Pakistan Sweets, Sharjah UAE (https://g.page/Paksweets?share) - We started off with Pakistani breakfast, and some of the biggest puri’s I’ve ever seen in my life. They were literally birthday balloon sized pieces of fried bread that completely puffed up as soon as they hit the oil. With the chickpea curry, they were delicious. Pakistani food breakfast of champions.

2. Mathaq Alzafran Pastry, Sharjah, UAE (https://goo.gl/maps/MdrehzcuxenEif2W9) - Immediately across the street you’ll find another Pakistani food breakfast favorites, payas, or goat feet stewed.

3. Al Ashiyah Cafeteria (https://goo.gl/maps/wEtfmdr1X9FFp1Mg7) - Al Ashiyah Cafeteria serves one of my favorite foods of all time - Pakistani chapli kebab. They are huge patty's of meat mixed with spices, and in this case an entire omelet, and fried in fat in a huge jacuzzi sized pan. Amazing you can get the real deal in Dubai!

4. Pak Liyari Al Nahda (https://g.page/pak-liyari-restaurant-al-nahda?share) -  Next up on this ultimate Dubai Pakistani food tour we headed to Pak Liyari Al Nahda, where they serve one of the best biryani in Dubai. Their biryani is so fluffy and fragrant with just the right amount of spice and oily meats. Absolutely delicious, and don’t miss their green chicken!

5. Mama Machi Restaurant (https://g.page/Mama-machi?share) - Next up, Pakistani fried fish, and it actually has a unique story in that the restaurant is fully run by Keralites, yet they still serve Pakistani style fried fish. Highly recommended, really tasty.

6. Bar.B.Q Tonight (https://goo.gl/maps/fMKNWhW8YKYKiT6s5) - Finally to complete this food tour, there was no way we could go on a Pakistani food tour without eating a karahi and bbq meats. We also met up with some great friends and fellow creators for a delicious celebration Pakistani meal!

YBN Cordae - Kung Fu (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"YBN Cordae - Kung Fu - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Think NWA meets GTA. YBN (Young Boss Niggas), a multi-member unit, formed after the country-wide collective met while freestyling as they played online video games. The crew began to make noise beyond the gaming community when YBN Nahmir’s “Rubbin Off The Paint” music video was released on WorldStar. The track served up Nahmir to be the face of YBN, with his “Rick and Morty” references and menacing, monotone flow. The Alabama native later returned with “Bounce Out With That,” a record that is just as inspired by the Bay Area as the young star’s best work. YBN Almighty Jay and YBN Cordae also quickly emerged, with standouts “Chopsticks” and “Kung Fu,” respectively. The pair, one from Texas and the other from the DMV, offer contrasting options when compared to Nahmir, with Almighty Jay’s drippy styling and Cordae’s backpack fare. Riding high with the release of the YBN mixtape, these three are prepping new music to arrive in 2019. For our DSCVR ATW performances, Nahmir and Almighty Jay teamed up for the bouncy “Nah For Real,” and Cordae helmed things for a solo flight through his flicky “Kung Fu.”

Israel and UAE in historic direct flight following peace deal - BBC News,"The first commercial flight from Israel to the UAE has landed, marking a major step in normalising relations after the announcement of a peace deal.
The El Al airliner made the three-hour trip, carrying a delegation of Israeli and US officials.
The flight was allowed to cross Saudi Arabian airspace, normally blocked to Israeli air traffic.
The UAE became only the third Arab country in the Middle East to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948.
On Saturday the UAE repealed a law boycotting Israel which had been in place since 1972, and earlier this month the two countries opened direct telephone services for the first time.

What If Pangaea Never Broke Apart,"If Pangaea never broke apart, life on Earth would look completely different. For starters, there’d be just one giant supercontinent, so no separate continents like we have now—imagine being able to drive from what’s now Africa to South America! The climate would be wild, too, with a huge dry desert in the middle because rain wouldn’t reach that far inland. Animals and plants would have evolved differently, since they wouldn’t be separated by oceans, meaning we might not even recognize some of today’s species. Humans might’ve developed in one giant community instead of spreading across the globe in different ways. It’s fun to imagine, but it’s safe to say the world would be a totally unrecognizable place!

"Placerville, CA to the Rubicon Trail and Coffee from a Helicopter - Ultimate Adventure 2016","Part 3 of Ultimate Adventure 2016. Sleep? We don’t need no stinkin’ sleep on Ultimate Adventure! What do you do when you spend most of the night making repairs in your hotel parking lot? That’s right – you get up bright and early before the sun is up, make more repairs, and then head out for the trail! In this case, that trail happens to be the most famous in the world: the Rubicon. Everybody with a 4x4 has dreamed of running it. Now, no matter where you live you can come along with the Ultimate Adventure as it locks the hubs and drops through the Gatekeeper at the beginning of the Rubicon Trail for the first time since UA hit this trail on the 2001 Ultimate Adventure. We shuffled ahead of a couple big groups airing down to get our foot in the door and earn a clean shot to our campsite half-way through at Buck Island Lake. And thanks to a pretty severe winter and the fact that we hit the trial rather early in the season before most of the big Jamborees rolled through, the Rubicon was all kinds of torn up and extra-challenging. We definitely put the Warn winches and Bubba Rope recovery product to the test on this one. And just when you think we’re done for the day and it’s siesta time, here comes the helicopter with our afternoon cups of coffee. Only on the UA! For more action, videos, pictures check out www.4wor-ua.com.

Catch the entire week of 2016 Ultimate Adventure on the Motor Trend Channel December 12th through December 16th with a new video premiering each day!

Climate change impacts in the Middle East & North Africa - Greenpeace MENA - Morocco,"A short documentary 🎞️ on the Moroccan 🇲🇦 Sahara, where oases and the Bedouin lifestyle are suffering from the impacts of climate change.

This documentary is part of a series produced by Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa (MENA) presenting the grave climate impacts on communities and the natural world in six countries around the region.

The documentaries were produced to coincide with the publication of a new report from Greenpeace Research Laboratories, entitled ‘Living on the Edge: The Implications of Climate Change for Six Countries in the Middle East North Africa Region’.

The report presents details of how ecosystems, inhabitants and livelihoods in Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates are all suffering from the impacts of rampant climate change.

"No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha, Ukraine - BBC News","At the base of a block of flats in Bucha, the sound of sawing echoes around the deserted communal garden.

In one of the doorways a blackened kettle boils on an open fire, blowing clouds of steam into the bitter air. This place should be buzzing with life and sound, with the chatter of children playing and clambering over the climbing frame that dominates the square.

But since the Russians came, everything has changed here. Most people fled, and they're yet to return. There's just one small, hardy group who are trying to pave the way for others to come back.

Lyrics:
It’s so good I almost can’t believe it 
Far beyond what hearts could ever dream
The God who set the galaxies in motion
Would descend to give His life for me

For what could make perfection bleed for sinners
What leads a King to pay so great a cost
All my life my heart will sing the answer
Only the love of God

Singing oh how great is the love of God
He paid our debt on that rugged cross
For all our days we will sing our Savior's praise
How great is the love of God

It’s so kind it leads us to repentance
It’s so bright the darkness has to flee
Hallelujah it cleared my guilty sentence
For I was bound but now I stand redeemed

For what could break the chains of any prison
What force could rob the power from the grave
What would trade my rags for heaven's riches
Only the love of God

Singing oh how great is the love of God
He paid our debt on that rugged cross
For all our days we will sing our Savior's praise
How great is the love of God

Though I try my mind can’t comprehend it
It’s so high too marvelous for words
I could sing a million songs about it
And barely scratch the surface of Your worth

This all my life the banner I’ll be waving
My anthem cry no matter what may come
And when I rise to walk the streets of heaven
I’ll still be singing this song
(oh, my song)
For everything that You’ve done
How great the love of God

(Hey)

Singing Oh how great is the love of God (how great is Your love)
He paid our debt on that rugged cross (He paid it all for me)
For all our days we will sing our Savior’s praise
How great is the love of God

Singing Oh how great is the love of God
He paid our debt on that rugged cross
For all our days we will sing our Savior's praise
How great is the love of God
How great is the love of God

(Thank you Jesus)

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Sports and Health: The State of Play in America | The Forum at HSPH,"The vast majority of children in America play sports. But while about three out of four adults played sports when they were younger, only one in four still plays sports today, and men are more than twice as likely as women to play. Why do we give up sports as we grow older? A new poll conducted by NPR, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health offers fresh insight into how and why adults and kids do — and don’t — play sports. What obstacles keep adults off the field? How can sports help keep kids and adults healthy, and how might programs and policies encourage more widespread participation, particularly among women and lower-income adults? What role do parents play in helping children get, and stay, active?

This Forum event was presented July 16, 2015, in Collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Though he is the most-brilliant supervillain the world has known, Megamind (Will Ferrell) is the least-successful. Thwarted time and again by heroic Metro Man (Brad Pitt), Megamind is more surprised than anyone when he actually manages to defeat his longtime enemy. But without Metro Man, Megamind has no purpose in life, so he creates a new opponent, who quickly decides that it's more fun to be a bad guy than a hero.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Lyrics: 

Can I talk to ya 
I know you got some questions 
What’s the hardest thing you’re going through 
Let’s talk about it 
 
Talkin bout mountains 
Talkin bout pain 
Talkin bout my life 
When will it change 
Talkin bout all things 
God can do all things 
 
Talkin bout nights I lose my way 
And my dreams 
That have been erased 
Talkin bout all things 
I said God can do all things 
 
I understand 
 
I know days it won’t always be easy (Yeah) 
So it’s good to know I’ll never let You down 
Talkin bout all things 
All the big and the small things (I’m so sure) 
God can do all things 
 
Talkin bout doubts that flood my mind 
I’m out of funds and I’m out of time 
I need a blessing 
I need You to do all things 
 
See, I understand that 
 
I know days it won’t always be easy (And just in case I fall) 
So it’s good to know I’ll never let You down (Yeah) 
Talkin bout all things (All things) 
All the big and the small things 
God can do all things 
 
Say it again 
 
Talkin bout all things 
All the big and the small things (Let’s go) 
God can do all things 
 
 
Just because He’s silent 
Doesn’t mean that He’s still 
He’s not only preparing it for you 
He’s preparing you for it 
Let’s go 
 
Talkin bout all things 
All the big and the small things (Hallelujah) 
Talkin bout doors you’ve never seen (Yeah) 
Blessings on blessings for you to receive 
 
Talkin bout all things 
All the big and the small things (He sees You) 
Talkin bout doors you’ve never seen (Yes) 
Blessings on blessings for you to receive 
 
Talkin bout all things (See the blessing’s coming) 
All the big and the small things (But He had to get you ready for it)  
Talkin bout doors you’ve never seen (Yessir) 
Blessings on blessings for you to receive (Haha, what we talkin bout) 
 
All things (Woo, haha what we talkin bout) 
All things (Come on say) 
All things (Say it again, uh) 
 
All things (And my people say) 
God can do it, He can do it (Woo) 
All things (Yeah) 
All things (Yessir) 
 
All things (Nothing is impossible) 
God can do it, He can do it (All things work together) 
All things (You can’t give up now, hey) 
All things (What we talkin bout) 
 
Talkin bout all things (Hallelujah)

Ayra Starr - Bloody Samaritan (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Ayra Starr - Bloody Samaritan - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

As if manifested by her twinkling surname, Ayra Starr seems destined for the spotlight. Growing up between Lagos and Cotonou, Benin (which are separated by country borders but only 125kms apart), young Ayra feasted on a musical diet of Rihanna, Shakira, gospel, and the first wave of Afrobeats. “I come from a very musical household. My uncle was very musical, my grandad played guitar, my mum used to do reggae when she was younger,” recalls the now 20-year-old, whose creative team mirrors another Artist To Watch alum: Billie Eilish. Like the “bad guy” singer, Starr’s brother is her writing and production partner, and her mother is her biggest champion. Both young women also share a penchant for being unfiltered. “F**k society/F**k you wannabes/F**k your hypocrisy,” Starr jabs on “Ase,” from her debut album ‘19 & Dangerous.’ It was released last August on Mavin Records, which has been home to Rema and Tiwa Savage. As the story goes, in 2019 Mavin head honcho Don Jazzy was in her DM’s an hour after she posted a song tribute to her late father. Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and NME have also fallen for her intoxicating blend of Afrosoul, R&B and West African pop. High fives were likely passed around when the Nigerian songbird’s fem-empowered “Rush” surpassed 20 million views less than a month after its release this fall; she directed it. That incisive voice of hers was right upfront during her ATW performance of the track, which is yet another addition to her bulging trophy case. Same too with a live whirl of her biggest track to date, “Bloody Samaritan.” What else is there to say: Ayra’s a star.

Lyrics:
What! Yeah. I came to break the rules.
It's about to get dangerous

I came to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs
Im here to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs

Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I’m hitting nay nay nay nay
I got the opps screaming mayday
Pockets looking like payday
I'm rich forever, this a different bracket
Yeah Im never lacking, gotta keep it ratchet
I'm mission minded and all you do is lacking
They gonna have to lay me down
Before I quit
Imma get it any minute
Yeah I caught them in they feeling
Take a village or country homie
I keep it up-beat homie
The devil my opp
I beat up his homies
Im tryna pack out the parties in heaven
Now here go the invite
I got hope
In my windpipe
You'll be out of breath
At these heights

It's about to get dangerous

Im here to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs
I came to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs
Im here to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs

I need my points , hit up mans
I don't want songs
Come with a dance
I love wife
I sound like chance
Stop saying Oui
I don't know french
Got them good genes
Im always tan
Always on go
Don't need to advance
Im bout to zoom
I don't feel bad if you wake up at noon
Its gotta be God when it comes out the blue
I came w the squad you know what it do
If i came to play
Y'all came to lose
Remember the times i played w no shoes
An Now i got so many pairs they coming in 2’s
I got the juice
I gotta juke
I gotta moves
I do what i want
You Don’t need to approve nothing

It's about to get dangerous

Im here to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs
I came to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls

I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs

Hello I’m in the field with my dawgs can’t talk right now plus I got alotta business to attend to 
Not too many that I rock with it’s awkward but I ain’t gonna fake or pretend too Fernie 
Lord carried me like weekend at Bernie’s 
You still doing dirt have a decent attorney cause mine never lost and I’m free as a birdie 
He paid the cost waved the fee when he heard me 
This not for the faint of heart 
this for the heroes who play their part 
we went from zero and raised the bar 
Praise the lord!
This for my babies this for my legacy this for my lady, I broke the rules did my time so I’m gravy
Social club misfits and shepherd the navy
No if ands or maybes make sure it’s for certain 
My spirit feel crazy I call that discernment 
The game in a hearse bro I call that internment 
Too many puppets like piggy and Kermit 
They hate when you quiet and say you a hermit 
But when you make noise they ask you for a permit
I’m under grace and I ain’t have to earn it
I’m one of them ones you don’t have to confirm it
Fernie 

It's about to get dangerous

I came to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs
I'm here to break the rules
Im here to tear down the walls
I’m here to answer the call
I’m in the field with my dawgs

Back in India!! 🇮🇳 INDIAN SEAFOOD HEAVEN + Ultimate Food Tour in Mangalore!,"🇹🇭 Huge Prawns in Thailand: https://youtu.be/gPNkOTYmD0E
👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ 

MANGALORE, INDIA - Mangalore, on the West Coast of India in the state of Karnataka is a seafood paradise. Today we’re going on a an ultimate Indian seafood tour! Get ready for some of the best fish fry and seafood masala in India! 

Dhakke Fish Market - It’s always good to know where you fresh seafood is coming from and so first thing we did was explore the central fish market. Mangalore is known for quite a large fishing industry. 

Hotel Narayana (https://maps.app.goo.gl/PzGqPqwgYESppMHX8) - Going to the fish market, you’ll be ready to eat seafood and Hotel Narayana is famous for their fish fry and only fish fry. They have a variety of fish, especially kingfish and pomfret which they coat in their magical masala, and fry in coconut oil. It’s something truly incredible, especially with the crispy fried masala. Meals here cost about 500 INR ($6 USD)

Machali Seafood (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wzo6xuT4GSKy71Nx7) - Next up on this Indian food tour, Machali Seafood is known to be one of the best and most popular seafood restaurants in Mangalore and they attract a huge crowd everyday. We tried about a dozen different incredible dishes including their famous shell less crab ghee roast, pomfret green masala, and crispy rava fish fry. 

Giri Manja’s (https://maps.app.goo.gl/HAfs3xNBezsDhv4CA) - Another legendary seafood restaurant in Mangalore is Giri Manja’s. We tried their famous fish fry, golden prawns, and probably my favorite, the extra spicy Indian mackerel. 

Mangalore is a friendly city in South India where you’ll find some mind blowing Indian seafood dishes. It’s an incredible place, highly recommended.

Coronavirus: 'Hundreds of thousands of UK tests within weeks' - BBC News,"Alok Sharma starts by confirming the latest infection figures and number of deaths, which were announced earlier.

He says 2,352 people who tested positive for the virus have died in UK hospitals, a rise of 563 on yesterday’s figure.

He adds that a total of 152,979 people have been tested for the virus, of whom 29,474 returned a positive result.

The number of people currently in hospital with the virus has risen to 10,767, the largest numbers in London and West Midlands.

He says “all our thoughts and prayers” are with those who have lost loved ones, adding that the death of a 13-year-old shows the virus is indiscriminate in who it targets.

12 Famous Logos With a Secret Meaning,"A logo is the face of a brand, and we often buy this or that item because its “face” is well-known to the world. Come on, don’t deny it! As for the best logos, they convey a hidden subtext that represents the company’s values, goals, or history. So, here are 12 world-famous logos with a secret hidden meaning!  

TIMESTAMPS: 
Airbnb 1:15
TripAdvisor 2:02
MasterCard 2:55 
Dell 3:53
National Geographic 4:26
Vodafone 5:08
Haribo 6:00

Preview photo credit: 
Firefox logo used since June 2013 (version 23.0 Beta), Previous version of logo, used since Firefox 3.5: By © The Mozilla Foundation, CC BY 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.es, https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Mozilla_Firefox_logo_2013.svg
Animation is created by Bright Side

Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

SUMMARY: 
- The logo contains 4 simple yet meaningful elements: the head of a person that represents a user of their site, the sign for a location on a map to show where the house or apartment is, a heart to represent love, and, finally, all of these symbols combine to make the letter “A” for Airbnb.
- TripAdvisor’s logo is an owl, which symbolizes wisdom and knowledge. As for its different-colored eyes, they show that each traveler has a choice to make: green means go, and red means no!
- The international payment system we all know these days as MasterCard was established in 1966 as Interbank. Red stands for bravery, passion, and for doing what makes you feel joy. The bright yellow symbolizes prosperity.
- Ever wonder why the “E” in Dell’s logo is all askew? Well, the founder of the company, Michael Dell, wanted to convey the meaning of the popular idiom “turn the world on its ear,” which means to change something in an exciting way.
- National Geographic, the popular magazine and channel that broadcasts documentaries in 171 countries, made its logo a yellow rectangle. The rectangle symbolizes a door that’s open to the world of knowledge about nature, science, and culture. Yellow and bright just like the Sun. 
- Vodafone is a British mobile provider that operates mostly in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The company chose a couple of mysterious things for its logo, which looks sort of like an earphone. The designers wanted to show that, with Vodafone, users can talk to each other any time they want.
- The Haribo’s founder combined the first 2 letters of his first and last name, Hans Riegel, and added the first 2 letters of his hometown of Bonn.
- The arrows on the first and last letters of the Subway logo are there for a reason: they actually stand for the entrance and exit to the subway. This way, the company demonstrates that, with Subway, you can eat on the go, like in the actual subway!
- Jim Lee revealed what the new logo of DC Comics actually means. The nooks and angles are meant to evoke the Superman “S” symbol, the Wonder Woman “WW” emblem, and the Bat-Signal. 
- “Firefox” is the English translation of the Chinese name for a red panda. This way, the company wanted to demonstrate how unique they are because this is a very rare kind of panda that’s actually endangered.
- The legend goes that the wife of Bacardi’s co-founder saw a bat in their liquor factory. But instead of getting scared and running for the exit, he took it as a sign and decided that this was exactly what should be on the logo.
- If you look closely at the Orbit's logo, you’ll notice that the capital “O” is split into 2 parts: one dark and one light. In the background you can see the image of an orbit. So, it’s clear that the “O” symbolizes day and night and a planet revolving around the Sun.

Why Some Foods Go Boom in the Microwave,"You use these things every day, and they seem plain and clear, but it turns out, a lot of them are hiding secrets you'd never guess about. Holes or ""eyes""  in cheese are made by bacteria used in the process of production. Glass breaks so easily because its atoms are arranged rather loosely and randomly. Tree rings can not only tell you how old a tree is but also how the weather has been changing during its lifetime. Chip bags have excess air inside to cushion chips during shipping and prevent them from getting crushed.

Fousheé - sing about love (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Fousheé - sing about love . An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Fousheé’s “Deep End” has almost certainly graced the eardrums of frequent TikTok visitors. But the story behind the song’s prevalence is a little more complicated than the alt-soul singer cashing in on viral fame. Initially, Brooklyn rapper Sleepy Hollow sampled her airy hook - “I’m about to go off the deep end” - without giving credit to this former contestant on 'The Voice.' Frustratingly for Fousheé, that version blew up. Undeterred, she fought to make the best of the situation, working with TikTok to eventually get her name on Sleepy Hollow’s song. The vid for “Deep End” embraces the track’s history. “It’s about fighting to get what’s due, because it isn’t always going to be handed to you,” she says of the vid in which she literally does battle with a creepy stalker. The carefree follow-up, “single af,” solidifies her artistic essence as a fierce advocate for Black female independence and empowerment. Needless to say, we’re big fans of that ethos, so it was a pleasure to welcome Team Fousheé into the DSCVR studio, where she delivered an exclusive performance of her new track, “sing about love.” “I want to be a shining example to Black women everywhere,” she says. With March being Women’s History Month, it’s that much more special to share an artist of this character with music fans.

Hundreds of kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls freed – BBC News,"A group of nearly 300 girls who were kidnapped from a school in north-western Nigeria last week have been released, a local official says.

The girls were abducted by gunmen from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday and taken to a forest, police said.

The state's governor said on Tuesday that the group had been freed and the girls were now safe.

The 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria, but a surge in recent attacks is suspected to be the work of criminal gangs.

Success and Preparation,"At 1:47 a.m. EST (6:47 UTC) on Nov. 16, 2022, NASA’s Orion spacecraft launched atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from historic Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on a path to the Moon, officially beginning the Artemis I mission. 

Over the course of 25.5 days, Orion performed two lunar flybys, coming within 80 miles (129 kilometers) of the lunar surface. At its farthest distance during the mission, Orion traveled nearly 270,000 miles (435,000 kilometers) from our home planet. NASA’s Orion spacecraft successfully completed a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 9:40 a.m. PST (12:40 p.m. EST) as the final major milestone of the Artemis I mission. 

Artemis I set new records of performance, exceeded efficiency expectations, and established new safety baselines for humans in deep space. This is a prelude to what comes next—following the success of Artemis I, human beings will fly around the Moon on Artemis II.

China issues warning over Hong Kong election - BBC News,"The Chinese government has responded to the landslide victory for pro-democracy candidates in the Hong Kong elections by emphasising that the city will always be ruled from Beijing - and has warned against further protests. Pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 per cent of seats in local elections. The result is being seen as an outright rejection of Carrie Lam's leadership and a huge show of support for the anti-Beijing protests that have been going on for months. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports from Hong Kong.

India-China clash: 20 Indian troops killed in Ladakh fighting - BBC News,"At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese forces in a disputed Himalayan border area, Indian officials say.

The incident follows rising tensions, and is the first deadly clash in the border area in at least 45 years.

The Indian army initially said three of its soldiers had been killed, adding that both sides suffered casualties.

But later on Tuesday, officials said a number of critically injured soldiers had died of their wounds.




China and India have accused each other of provoking fighting in which at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a disputed Himalayan border area.

Soldiers reportedly brawled with sticks, bats and bamboo sticks studded with nails in the late-night confrontation in the Ladakh region on Monday.

However, no shots were fired.

India's army said that both sides suffered casualties. China confirmed the incident but did not give details.

The Indian statement notes that injured soldiers were ""exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the high altitude terrain"".

McLaren 750s – Driven. Ultimate track-ready Road Car? | MotorTrend,"At MotorTrend’s 2024 Performance Vehicle of the Year, we were blessed to have McLaren’s almighty 750s Coupe, and even more blessed to have a race track at our disposal.  

Technically this thing sits between the 720S and the 765LT, though McLaren say it’s pretty much the equal of the long tail in terms of performance. The 750s is an animal, and despite being super light, crazy powerful and rear-wheel drive, it remains just as confidence inspiring and drivable as the 720s, but now with added punch!

What If Humans Were Cold-Blooded?,"If humans were cold-blooded, we’d rely on the environment to control our body temperature, just like reptiles do! On chilly days, we’d need to bask in the sun to warm up and be active, but on super-hot days, we’d have to find shade or cool off in water to avoid overheating. Our energy needs would drop because cold-blooded creatures don’t burn calories to stay warm, so maybe fewer snacks—but way more naps! Life would be slower and more tied to the weather, and extreme climates might be tough for survival. Fancy heated houses or cooling systems might not matter much anymore; we’d just adapt to our surroundings. On the bright side, no more sweating or shivering—just soaking up the vibes of the weather!

This Huge Volcano Is Due to Erupt - What If It Happened Today,"What would happen if Vesuvius Volcano erupted today? It’s erupted many times in the past. In fact, that's how it got its shape. It's made of multiple layers of hardened lava, pumice, and ash. Vesuvius last erupted in 1944. But a major blast happened there nearly 2,000 years ago. It buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and decimated the surrounding areas.

The tragic eruption have left a deep mark in modern history. Mount Vesuvius is regarded as one of the deadliest volcanos in the human history. But today, 3 million people live less than 20 milesfrom the volcano, and 600,000 live in the danger zone. Large eruptions happen every few thousand years, usually after long periods of calm. And the trouble is, Vesuvius is long overdue for its next one...

36 UNBELIEVABLE CRAFTS YOU CAN MAKE IN 5 MINUTES,"EASY CRAFT PROJECTS

This video is full of fun and colorful crafts that you can make with your family! You will learn how to decorate your t-shirt, shoes, cool cement crafts and more!
Cement is cool material and you can make a lot of crafts out of it! And it won’t require much effort. If you want to add something special to your garden or make an awesome planter for succulents, try to make concrete hands. Supplies you will need cement, disposable gloves, and a bowl. Mix cement with water according to the instruction on the package and carefully pour into disposable gloves. Push the cement through the rubber gloves and place them into the bowl. Place hands into the bowl and make a shape you like. Let’ the cement dry and disposable remove gloves. Now it’s time to plant your favorite succulents! Cement is one of the best materials for crafting because you can make also a piece of furniture out of it. Yes, it sounds surprising but we share an easy way to make a cement stool with wooden legs. Take a bucket and pour a concrete mix inside. Once the concrete has settled, place the legs in the bucket. Secure legs with sticky tape to prevent falling down. When the concrete has fully hardened take the stool out of a bucket. Ready!
One more cool idea is concrete letters. Cut cardboard and make a mold, wrap it in tape to avoid a leak. Pour concrete inside and let dry. Remove the mold and use these letters to decorate your home or any special event. Also, you can paint letters in any color you like. 
Also, you will find a collection of ideas on how to make cute candle holders. You can use lace to patter the candle holders. Or you can even make pillow-shaped candle holders using a zip-lock plastic bag.

Israel says bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza recovered | BBC News,"Israel says its forces have recovered the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
 
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies were located on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area.
 
The IDF named the hostages as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino.
 
Spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said an initial assessment was they were ""brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them"".
 
A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, insisted Israel was responsible for their deaths, as it has refused to sign a ceasefire deal.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not rest until those responsible for their killing are brought to justice.

Beat Asteroids Game Using a Neural Network - JavaScript Tutorial,"This complete JavaScript tutorial shows how to automate an asteroids game using a neural network.

This tutorial keeps the complex theory to a minimum and demonstrates how to use a neural network in a real-world situation.

The tutorial builds off of a previous JavaScript tutorial that shows how to build an astroids game from scratch. However, viewing that tutorial first is not required.

MUSCAT, OMAN - Today we’re going on an ultimate Omani street food tour in Muscat, Oman! This is an incredible city, with friendly people, ancient history, and delicious local food. We’ll have a huge breakfast, try Omani sweets, eat arsiya and madbhi with rice at a popular local restaurant, and finally eat the greatest of all Omani street foods - mishkak and the shuwa burger. 

Huge thank you to Ahmed, Oman Travel & Tourism for taking us around Oman. Follow Ahmed: https://www.instagram.com/officialomantravels/ 

Rozna Restaurant (https://maps.app.goo.gl/EGC6EZEPGanM9fqB9) - We’re starting this Omani food tour at one of the best restaurants in Muscat. We tried Omani bread, fried liver, and a bunch of other Omani dishes. We also happened to meet the manager Sulaiman Alkindi, who gave us a full tour of the restaurant, and also let us sample the lamb shuwa right out of the underground oven. Total price - 11 OMR ($28.53)

Al Diwaniya Omani Sweets (https://maps.app.goo.gl/agqaVasvpd1oGnbk7) - Next up Ahmed took me to try Omani halwa, a dessert that’s also an Omani traditional celebration!

Kabsa & Madbhi (https://maps.app.goo.gl/vUMyTVUpMFnHQsU26) - This was one of the highlights of the day, a Arabian Omani meal of rice with rock smoked madbhi, and arsiya - an Omani dish of rice and lamb beaten until it’s smooth like a porridge. Total price - 18 OMR ($46.68)

Sightseeing in Muscat - Muscat is a beautiful city and after spending some time in the new city of Muscat, we then headed to the old city of Mutrah Fort for some amazing views, and also we visited Mutrah Souq to walk around and try some street food.

Mohsin Burger (https://maps.app.goo.gl/i1ZefDjSRsV7W7qw7) - One of the best Omani street foods is mishkak - Omani grilled meat skewers which are often served with tart tamarind sauce. We also couldn’t miss the shuwa burger, a delicious Omani burger topped with shuwa. Total price - 13 OMR ($33.72) 

Oman is an incredible country - rich in history, friendly locals, and plenty of delicious food to taste!

Again, a huge thank you to Ahmed for taking us on this Muscat street food tour!

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

What If All Volcanoes on Earth Start Erupting at Once,"Approaching the shores of Sicily, you're enjoying the views. The wind brings pleasant coolness, and you anticipate your vacation. But suddenly, the boat shakes, and you lose balance. You look up and see a huge plume of black smoke rising above the Etna volcano...

And then … all volcanoes on Earth start erupting at once. Almost immediately they bring disaster to their surrounding areas with hot lava and rockfall. As soon as that stops, smoke rises into the atmosphere, and ash starts falling to the ground. It looks like snow, only black. What will happen next?

#volcanoes #whatif #brightside

SUMMARY:
-The active volcanoes, like Etna in Sicily, will start spitting fire and rocks. They haven't been slumbering to start with, so the magma at their core is hot and volatile.
-Other volcanoes will have been sleeping for too long, and their stock of lava wasn't that huge to begin with, so they won't really make a blast.
-Most volcanoes are underwater, so their eruptions will be very different. When a submerged volcano erupts, no one on the surface will even notice it if they're just a bit away.
-There are only four supervolcanoes on the planet, the most famous being the Yellowstone supervolcano.
-Almost immediately volcanoes bring disaster to their surrounding areas with hot lava and rockfall. As soon as that stops, smoke rises into the atmosphere, and ash starts falling to the ground. It blankets all surfaces, smothering grass, trees, and bushes, and they stop producing oxygen.
-CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and after a while its high concentration in the atmosphere will warm up the planet again. Soon, the temperatures will rise to unbearable values, and it’ll be scalding hot until CO2 goes away at least in part.
-About 95% of all living things are gone — it’s basically the same as what happened when a meteorite struck the planet in the era of dinosaurs.
-When carbon dioxide dissipates and the temperature returns to more or less normal, plants will start appearing.
-New and bigger species appear. They continue evolving and growing. At some point in the distant future, there appears the first species that learns to use tools.
-Scientists point out there has never been an eruption of this kind on Earth, and there’s no indication it might happen in the future.

Hong Kong's new security law - BBC News,"The UK, Australia, Canada and US have released a joint statement expressing 'deep concern' at a new security law for Hong Kong that has been introduced by China. 

The four countries say the law will 'curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous'. 

Ros Atkins has been looking at why China has brought in the law - and assessing its considerable consequences.

"26 Handy Gadgets You Need At Home || Kitchen, Cleaning And Beauty Gadgets","We tested unbelievable gadgets only a genius could think of

Sometimes, we don’t know what we need or what we like until we see someone using it. In this video, I show you some awesome and cool gadgets that will make your life easier in a heartbeat. 
There’s a rectangular tool where you attach multiple shoe covers inside. When you get into the house, you simply step on it, and then shoe cover will immediately cover your feet. 
There’s an awesome bin, where you can add your bag rolls at its bottom. This way you’ll always have an available bin bag at hand that comes straight up from the bottom. 
When it comes to cooking, I also show you a brilliant bowl cover you can use to avoid splatters in your kitchen when you’re using your electric whisk. 
There are some zip lock bags that are also vacuum sealed. You can use them for your food, close them, remove the oxygen, and you can keep your food fresh for months. 

Timestamps: 
0:18 – Cool shoe cover dispenser
2:06 – The pillow blanket
5:17 – The avocado cutter
7:50 – Awesome tweezers
9:27 – Bracelet/ring gadget

What would it mean if Finland and Sweden join Nato? - BBC News,"Finland and Sweden are said to be considering a joint bid to join Nato despite fears of retaliation from Russia.

Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers.

But, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said ""everything had changed"" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be ""prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead.

Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto has said it would be ""useful"" for Sweden and Finland to launch joint Nato membership bids, but added that no fixed date had been set for any potential application.

The BBC's Ros Atkins explains the latest developments.

Sudan: MSF Launches Measles Vaccination Campaign in Camps for Displaced People,"The conflict in Sudan has displaced millions of people. Many of them are taking refuge in camps in White Nile State. As more people arrive to the already overcrowded camps and surrounding areas, people who fled the fighting are struggling to access essential services like medical care.
 
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are helping provide primary health care in three camps in White Nile State. When an outbreak of suspected measles cases occurred in Alagaya camp, MSF launched a vaccination campaign for children under five years old, many of whom had not received any previous vaccinations. These vaccinations will help to curb outbreaks, but the medical and humanitarian needs in the camps are greater than what MSF can provide alone.

"Haiti: After a gruesome attack, MSF suspends activities","Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Head of Mission in Haiti Diana Arroyo told Al Jazeera on November 20 that MSF is suspending all medical activities in Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince until further notice. This follows an attack on an MSF ambulance that resulted in the execution of at least two patients and physical harm to our staff on November 11, and a series of threats by Haitian police forces against our staff.  

MSF has been working in Haiti for more than 30 years, and health care services have never been as limited for people in the country as they are right now, as the country faces unrelenting violence on top of a spiraling political and economic crisis. Though our services are urgently needed, MSF cannot resume admissions of new patients to our facilities in Port-au-Prince unless we are guaranteed unhindered security and respect for our medical and humanitarian mandate by armed groups, members of vigilante groups, and law enforcement officers.

LU KALA - Hotter Now (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2024,"LU KALA – Hotter Now | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024

“I don’t feel the pressure to change myself. I’m here because I am myself.” That kind of self-realization lies at the core of Lu Kala’s ethos; it was there from the very beginning with her first release, “DCMO (Don’t Count Me Out).” Over glossy snaps, claps, and trap hats, she delivered her first sermon about body positivity. “I know I’m big girl/And you are afraid to claim me… I’ll never be that picture baby/But I lie when I say that I don’t care what you think.” It’s that last line that really makes the difference, because it’s important to acknowledge that self-doubt and self-confidence aren’t mutually exclusive. Life ain’t always sunshine and roses. Lu simply wants to lead listeners towards more moments of inner peace. “Inspiring people keeps me motivated,” the Rihanna fan told us. “I just feel like I didn’t see a lot of Black pop stars growing up.” Thanks to the Lizzos and The Weeknds of the world, representation has improved in the past decade or two. But Lu’s ready to take it a step further. She talks dental insecurities on “Love Shit.” On her new single “Hotter Now,” she claims that what doesn’t kill you makes you, in fact, hotter. Basically, if you need a cheerleader in your life, this former songwriter for Jennifer Hudson awaits you with pom poms in hand. You just gotta press play. The funked out “Pretty Girl Era” has been a staple on pop playlists since it arrived last winter. Listen to it when you’re in front of the vanity. Lu promises it’ll help make you feel like the “baddest bitch” when you go out. By the way, if you like the groove of that one, you’ll love her “Lottery” collab with Latto - which shot into the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. These performances of “PGE” and “Hotter Now” are prime examples of what it looks like when a pop artist is totally in their bag.

"Michelin Guide Street Food Tour!! $0.64 THAI CURRY NOODLES in Chiang Mai, Thailand!","🎥 Village Thai Food in Sukhothai: https://youtu.be/76FPnL1gCPk
👍 100% Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z

Chiang Mai, Thailand - We decided to go on a Thai street food Michelin Guide tour of Chiang Mai! All three of these amazing food stalls / restaurants, were featured in the 2020 Michelin Guide in Thailand, and all three were outstanding. If you have a chance to visit Chiang Mai, don’t miss them, highly recommended! #ThaiFood #MichelinGuide #streetfood

Guay Tiew Pet Tun Saraphi (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเป็ดตุ๋นสารภี) - https://goo.gl/maps/ntFqdd1KcoocpiC36 - Located a little outside of Chiang Mai city, this braised duck restaurant is well worth making the effort to get to. Their braised duck, has an amazing herbal flavor, and is a step above many others I’ve had. We ordered Rice and duck (ข้าวหน้าเป็ด) and Duck noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเป็ด). Both were amazing, but the noodles were the highlight for me. Price - 50 THB ($1.60) per bowl

Khanom Jeen Sanpakoi (ขนมจีนสันป่าข่อย (ไฮโซล้านนา) - https://g.page/sanpakoi?share - Next up on this Thai street food tour of Chiang Mai, we headed to the market for an amazing stall that’s hugely popular for their Northern Thai style curry. You can either choose rice of khanom jeen rice noodles - which are most popular. Then you can choose from a variety of their different Thai curries. I got, Khanom jeen nam ngiaw (ขนมจีนน้ำเงี้ยว), Green curry (ขนมจีนเขียวหวาน), and Beef curry (แกงเผ็ดเนื้อ). Another amazing thing about this place is that the plate of curry I had was just 20 ($0.64) per plate!

Khao Tom Yong (ข้าวต้มย้ง) - https://goo.gl/maps/WgMJrbrDt8f2gC4U6 - Finally to finish off these amazing Thai street food Michelin Guide tour of Chiang Mai, we went to Khao Tom Yong (ข้าวต้มย้ง) for some Thai Chinese dishes. We ordered, Clams, chili jam (หอยลายผัดพริกเผา), Eggplant (ผัดมะเขือยาว), Tom yum fish (ต้มยำปลากะพง), Chayote leaves (ผัดยอดมะระ), Snakeskin gourami salad (ยำปลาสลิด), White chives (ผัดกุยช่ายขาว). Food was delicious, and a great way to wrap up this entire day of delicious street food. Total price - 420 THB ($13.44)

24 SIMPLE YET BRILLIANT ART IDEAS,"AMAZING ART TUTORIALS EVERY ARTIST SHOULD KNOW

Art is an amazing way to express ourselves. Even if you aren’t a professional artist creating something out of scratch allows you to unleash your creativity and maybe decorate your home. It’s a win-win.
An amazing way to paint an abstract flower for your living room is to take some acrylic paint and add it in little blobs in a circle on your canvas. Then, layer different colors inside each blob and finally squish them with a paper towel before they dry. Remove the paper towel and voila.
Another thing you can try for decorative painting is to layer various colors below each other and before they dry use a fork to give them a wavy shape.
The most creative part of the whole process is that you get to use everyday items to make your paintings. You can use bathroom sponges to give your painting some texture. The point is to have some fun. You can add some elastic bands on a pencil and then attach a CD on them. Then you add some runny paint on the disk and you swirl it around. It will create a beautiful paint splatter painting.

CRAZY DAY IN THE AMAZON! Our local guide took us out on a boat down the Amazon River in Peru, then we turned into the flooded forest where he used a machete to chop a trail from our boat. Once on foot, we explored the region that Otorongo Expeditions are working to turn into a Reserve. We drank jungle beer, ate armored catfish, hydrated with a vine, found fossils in a creek, and eventually crashed our drone…..

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

24 COOL DIY IDEAS FOR YOUR PRANKS,"CRAZY PRANKS AND IDEAS FOR UPCOMING HOLIDAYS

I love pranks because it’s a cool way to spend time and have lots of fun! Moreover, pranks make holidays and events more memorable. But it’s important to remember that pranks shouldn’t be dangerous or too scary. Moreover, humor and laughter are very beneficial for health. 
Let’s start with an avocado prank. Take an empty stick deodorant container and clean it properly. Place inside mashed avocados and place them in the fridge. Start eating deodorant in front of your friends and check out his reaction. The coolest experiment is coke and mentos trick.  All you need to do is to drop Mentos candies into a coke bottle. You will get a fountain. It’s a cool way to prank your friends. One more cool idea is to make edible worms. To make edible worms you will need flexible straws, milk, cocoa powder, and gelatin. Mix the ingredients and microwave. Fill up the glass with the straws, making sure the flexible part of the straw is closer to the bottom. 
As a bonus, you will find lots of spy hack that will change your life!

LYRICS:
You’ve been trying hard to bear
The weight of all your shame
And if there’s a God up there
You’re sure He forgot your name
When your steps are getting heavy
And hope looks all but lost
Just bring it all to the cross

Who told you grace can’t reach
The messed up ones like you
Has the devil made you believe
The lies he tells are true
When you’re sure that you’re the one
Who’s wandered too far off
It’s not too late
Just come home to the cross

Come and see a Savior’s love
That would die to make you new
Nothing you have ever done
Can change what mercy’s done for you
And if you ever wonder
If you’re worth so great a cost
Look up and see
The cross

Everybody’s got a list
At least a mile long
Of every scar and every sin
From everywhere that we’ve gone wrong
But there’s reason for rejoicing
And the reason is because
That list was nailed to the cross

He was wounded for your wounds
Pierced for all your sin
By His stripes you are healed
Died so you could rise again
He let the blood and water flow
And did it all to let you know
You’re the reason that He went
To the cross
Oh He’s calling you to run home to
The cross

What Happens If There’s a Hole in Your Microwave,"You fear it and try to avoid it, but let's say it happened, and your microwave got a hole or crack in it? Is it still safe to use it? The microwave oven – as the name suggests – works with microwaves that bounce back and forth off the walls of the oven. With a leak, the waves can escape. Microwaves emit radiation, but it's not the DNA-damaging kind. And what about other household appliances?

A dark nymph, a wild creature, a pitcher, a river, a magic mask, a holy moth, two strange twins, plants, beasts and fire.

A story where the border between victim and oppressor is evanescent, a story tapping into classical culture and breathing an exotic and tribal air at the same time, continuing the previous stories.

That's Mediterranean nature, which can be found both in their artistic personality and in their new single IX. What you love is where you have left it.

Joe Biden allows Ukraine to strike inside Russia with missiles | BBC News,"US President Joe Biden has given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles supplied by America to strike Russia, officials say.
 
The move marks a major change in policy for Washington which had refused for months to agree to Kyiv's requests for authorisation to use the ATACMS missiles outside its own borders.
 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reacted to the news - which came via briefings from US officials - saying ""such things are not announced, missiles speak for themselves"".
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously warned Western nations against such a move, saying it would represent the Nato military alliance's ""direct participation"" in the Ukraine war.
 
UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, is also due to address the issue at the G20 summit of world leaders in Brazil, where he said shoring up support for Ukraine will be his top agenda.

Put Rubber Bands Over Your Door Knob If You Don’t Trust Anyone,"Ever heard of putting rubber bands over your door knob? It’s not just a random hack—it’s actually a clever trick for some extra peace of mind. If you’re staying somewhere unfamiliar or don’t trust your surroundings, wrapping a rubber band tightly around the inside and outside knobs can help prevent anyone from turning the handle easily. It’s like a simple DIY safety measure for those moments when you want a little extra security. Plus, it’s super easy to set up and costs basically nothing. So next time you’re feeling unsure, grab a rubber band, and you’ve got yourself a quick security boost!

"Asteroid Redirect Mission Briefing on This Week @NASA – September 19, 2016","On Sept. 14, officials from the White House and NASA discussed the space agency’s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) during a televised event at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. On the mission, which is targeted for launch in Dec. 2021, NASA plans to send a robotic spacecraft to an asteroid tens of millions of miles from Earth, capture a multi-ton boulder, and bring it to an orbit near the moon for future exploration by astronauts on a following mission aboard NASA’s Orion spacecraft. During the live discussion, John Holdren, assistant to President Obama for Science and Technology, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and ARM Program Director Michele Gates highlighted the mission’s scientific and technological benefits, how the mission will support NASA’s goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s, and how it will demonstrate technology relevant to defending Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids.

WHO ARE KARA AND NATE?!  - We decided to take a year off to travel the world in January 2016. Daily vlogging was not the original plan, but we quickly fell in love with it and now post a video of what we do every day! About halfway through the year, we knew we weren’t going to be ready to stop traveling in December, so now we have a new goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019! On our channel you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit ;)

Merveille - Paqueta (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Merveille - Paqueta (Live). Une performance exclusive pour Vevo DSCVR, la chaîne dédiée au meilleur de la nouvelle musique.

The first thing about Merveille that grabs you is her voice. It’s filled with pristine pathos, like a calm sea that has an entire world bubbling underneath. That’s why it’s shocking that the Paris native is only 16 years old. Raised in the 18th arrondissement and armed with an innate passion for artistic expression, she began singing at an early age. Congolese music played in the house, molding her tastes. Soon enough, bedroom recording sessions on BandLab had this Tems fan carving out her own sounds. Debut EP ‘Peace&love’ are a trio of songs that she recorded mostly on her phone.  Released early last year, the project revealed a soft yet self-assured new voice in the French R&B scene. Her soundscape widens and adds a new color with each release, whether she’s sliding over distorted bass on “Citadelle,” being a voice for her neighborhood on “Ghetto,” or blending genres like French alt-pop hero Stromae on “Paqueta.” Listeners across the world are responding in a big way; all three previously mentioned tracks have more than 10 million Spotify streams. Most of her colorful and incisive music videos soar into seven digits. Merveille’s latest achievement is this summer’s ‘IDENTITÉ’ EP, her most exciting project yet and a great excuse to get her on the DSCVR stage. These high-energy performances of “Paqueta” and “Vie priveé” will be revelatory to fans, and the best thing is that she’s only getting started.

J’suis dans un sale bourbier
Et maman ne fait que de prier
J’ai oublié les années, les années où j’ai merdé
J’sais pas si je les appelle “amis”
Ils se comportent comme mes ennemis
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá
Et vu qu’ils ragent sur moi, ils disent que je n’aurais jamais le platine (platine)

Hum

J’sais pas si je les appelle “amis”
Ils se comportent comme mes ennemis
Je chante la mélodie pour me sauver 
Est ce qu'un jour papa je serai sauvée?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, eh
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas

À la base, ils étaient pas là
Même ceux en dessous des draps
Parler et reparler, même si ma tête n'est plus là
Nan, j'peux pas m'cher-lâ, nan, j'peux pas m'cher-lâ
Ils vont parler et reparler même si mon corps n'est plus là
Ils font semblant de pas me reconnaître mais quand je suis devant eux ça crie “Merveille et SOS ?”
Ils font semblant ils veulent me la mettre mais quand je suis devant eux ils font semblant de pas me reconnaître

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, eh
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá 
J'te fais danser comme Lucas 
J'te fais danser comme Paquetá

"Responding to Urgent Medical Needs in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo","In the last two years, the unrest in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has forced thousands of people to flee their homes. Many have found refuge on the other side of the border between North and South Kivu. “We heard that there was peace in Katasomwa, so we decided to come here,” says Justin, a displaced person now living in this remote area of Kalehe Territory, South Kivu. “Since we got here in July, we have not been eating well … And this rain will end up killing us, we are homeless.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sent an emergency team to respond to the most urgent needs. The team focused first on groups with the highest mortality rates, mostly children under 15 and pregnant women. Maternal mortality in the area is very high. MSF teams are also rehabilitating health centers in the area and organizing a vaccination campaign in collaboration with health authorities. Read more at http://bit.ly/3oNVDaH

The Serbian faces deportation after his visa was cancelled for a second time, with the government labelling the 34-year-old a threat to public health.

His lawyers are appealing against what they called an ""irrational"" decision, with the hearing set for Sunday.

Djokovic is still scheduled to play the Australian Open on Monday in Melbourne.

"Dubai's Luxury Islands Are Empty, Here's Why","The World Islands is an archipelago in the United Arab Emirates and only one of many other magnificent artificial islands created there. And although the idea of man-made islands sounds very modern, the process has a long history. Many thousands of years ago, prehistoric people used to pile hundreds of boulders on lakes or rivers bottoms to create small islands. We do know the purpose of the ""chinampas"" - Aztec artificial islands for cultivating crops. 

What about more modern man-made islands? Nowadays, islands are created for the need for extra space. Many Asian airports are built on artificial islands. However, not all islands are made with a purpose. Most of the New York Harbor islands are man-made, but not all were actually planned. Belmont Island is just a pile of rocks, disposed of while constructing the underwater metro tunnel. The position of the largest man-made island is taken by the Netherlands island Flevoland. But for some people, one island is just not enough, and whole archipelagos are created. Four enormous projects were completed in the United Arab Emirates. One of them is the aforementioned The World archipelago. Let's have a closer look, shall we?

Thai Kanom Jeen Noodles (ขนมจีน) and Curry in Khorat (ขนมจีนครูยอด),"Nakhon Ratchasima (นครราชสีมา), but more commonly known just as Khorat (โคราช), is a city in the Isan province of Thailand. Ying and I headed there for a few days of hanging out and eating and one of the restaurants we ate at was Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด). More details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/10/kanom-jeen-restaurant-korat-thailand/

Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด) is most famous for serving kanom jeen noodles (ขนมจีน) and curry. What is kanom jeen? Kanom jeen are Thai rice vermicelli noodles, that are made fresh (instead of being dried), but left to ferment for a day or so. They are soft and slightly sour, and have a wonderful milky texture to them. Kanom jeen noodles (ขนมจีน) are served across the country of Thailand, from the south to the north, and they are really a beloved Thai staple dish. Sometimes kanom jeen noodles are eaten with salads like som tam, but most commonly, they go together with rich curry.

At Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด), we first order two different types of curry with the noodles. Our first dish was kanom jeen nam ya kati (ขนมจีน น้ำยากะทิ), which is a curry made with coconut milk. I’m normally used to eating the southern Thai style version of this dish, but this Isan version in Khorat town (โคราช),, was a little different. The curry was a beautiful blend of spices and herbs, all blended into a rich coconut milk gravy. What I really liked about it, was that it had a wonderful krachai, or fingerroot taste to it. Another thing I love so much about eating kanom jeen in Thailand, is that it’s always served with a big pile of fresh raw vegetables to eat on the side - you can usually eat as much vegetables as you want, and I like to pile them on top of my noodles and curry.

We also tried the kanom jeen gaeng gai (ขนมจีน แกงไก่), rice noodles topped with chicken curry. It was similar to a green curry in taste, but they just called it chicken curry. The chicken was again, curried in a coconut milk broth, with spices and herbs. It was alright, but I much preferred the kanom jeen nam ya kati (ขนมจีน น้ำยากะทิ) for its more spicy and richer flavor. Overall, both plates were very delicious and I could immediately tell why Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด) was such a popular restaurant to eat at in Khorat.

Along with our noodles, Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด) is also extremely well known for their fried chicken (ไก่ทอด), which happened to just be the wings, so we didn’t want to miss an opportunity to try them as well. They turned out to be very tasty - the chicken was fried hot and fresh, and they were crispy on the outside and just the right saltiness. The fried chicken went quite well with the curry. Also, to get some more protein, I couldn’t resist ordering a grilled fish, known as pla pao (ปลาเผา). The fish was coated in salt, and grilled. It was extremely juicy, the meat of the fish was firm and milky. Just like the fried chicken, it went extremely well with the kanom jeen noodles and the tasty curries.

Overall, I would definitely say that Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd (ขนมจีนครูยอด) is an excellent restaurant, and if you ever visit Khorat town (โคราช), you should definitely have a meal here.

Trump criticises Zelensky for saying end of Ukraine war is ‘far away' | BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is ""very, very far away"". 

He claimed on Truth Social that Europe, in their meeting with Zelensky, ""stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US"".

""Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?"" Trump added.

The comments come after European leaders suggested after a summit on Sunday that they cannot guarantee peace in Ukraine without US help.

Zelensky's trip to the UK over the weekend was after a heated exchange with Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office on Friday.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Grade 6th on Khan Academy: By the 6th grade, you're becoming a sophisticated mathemagician. You'll be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any non-negative numbers (including decimals and fractions) that any grumpy ogre throws at you. Mind-blowing ideas like exponents (you saw these briefly in the 5th grade), ratios, percents, negative numbers, and variable expressions will start being in your comfort zone. Most importantly, the algebraic side of mathematics is a whole new kind of fun! And if that is not enough, we are going to continue with our understanding of ideas like the coordinate plane (from 5th grade) and area while beginning to derive meaning from data!

Coronavirus in Pakistan: stretched resources and conspiracy theories - BBC News,"In Pakistan, doctors are warning the already weak healthcare system could soon be overwhelmed by Coronavirus patients. So far, with less than 2,000 deaths the outbreak hasn’t been as bad as some had feared. But with shops and businesses reopen, the rate of new cases and new deaths is at its highest levels. Staff at a number of major hospitals have told the BBC they’re running out of critical care beds – though officials insist there is capacity elsewhere. Meanwhile, doctors efforts are being hampered by bizarre conspiracy theories that have led to relatives attacking healthcare workers.

Trump: British IS fighters taken into US custody - BBC News,"Two of the so-called ""IS Beatles"" have been taken out of Syria to ""a secure location controlled by the US"", President Donald Trump has said.

El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are accused of being part of an Islamic State group cell which kidnapped and murdered Western hostages in Syria.

The pair - who are from London - are in the custody of the American military, according to US media reports.

In a tweet, Mr Trump described them as ""the worst of the worst"".

He said the decision to remove them from Syria had been taken ""in case the Kurds or Turkey lose control"".

Turkish forces are stepping up air strikes and a ground offensive, as their incursion into Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria enters a second day.

Turkey's military said it had seized designated targets. There are reports of heavy fighting in the central border region, and seven civilian deaths.

Tens of thousands of people are reported to be leaving their homes.

The assault on Kurdish-led forces, key US allies, follows US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops.

Turkey says it wants to create a ""safe zone"" on the border for many of the Syrian refugees on its territory.

EXPLORING SEOUL'S GRAND PALACE + Korean Fried Chicken!,"Planning a trip to Seoul? We want to make sure you have an amazing time! So, we put together a travel guide with 9 things you must do on your first trip to Seoul - http://karaandnate.com/9-things-you-must-do-in-seoul/ 

This ended up being one of our favorite days in Seoul! We squeezed so much into one day. First we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's massive and you could get lost exploring all day. It's popular to rent traditional dresses and take pictures in front of the detailed buildings which makes it a really fun place to walk around. The changing of the guards is also a super entertaining show to watch! Next we visited the picturesque village of Bukchon Hanok! And finally ended the night eating traditional Korean Fried Chicken at the park where all the local teens pitch tents and hang out all night!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rG_qesIL6s

Asleep at the Wheel: Drowsy Driving and Public Health,"Driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol has long been established as a public safety hazard. But what about hitting the road while fatigued? An estimated average of 83,000 accidents involving drowsy driving occurred annually between 2005 and 2009, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and some estimates are even higher. These accidents cost lives, cause injuries, and damage property. This Forum event explored the risks, impacts and prevention of drowsy driving. Speakers included Arianna Huffington, author of the new book The Sleep Revolution; Mark Rosekind, Head of NHTSA; Charles Czeisler, renowned sleep medicine expert; and Jay Winsten, leader of a large-scale media initiative to draw attention to the perils of distracted driving.

Presented May 10, 2016, in Collaboration with The Huffington Post.

Sports Team - The Races (Live / Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020),"Sports Team - The Races - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

Don’t worry, Sports Team are charmingly aware of the fact that the cool kids don’t love the rock lingo anymore. “There’s no money in guitar music,” guitarist Rob Knaggs explained to Vice earlier this year. “The press aren’t really looking at it...so if you’re not having fun, why are you doing it?” In our estimation, the UK outfit is having an absolute blast while “doing it.” Sports Team’s trademark love-it-or-leave-it attitude epitomizes the group’s buzzy ascension into indie rock acclaim. While studying at Cambridge and “listening to Pavement all the time,” the brainy teens cooked up a genius recipe for packing clubs: be really, really fun to watch on stage. Stuck in a lackluster DIY music scene at the prestigious-but-stuffy university, the sextet embarked on a mission to attract crowds purely through captivating live spectacles. “So much of it is about self-confidence,” says Alex Rice, the band’s raucous frontman. “Because if you’re not prepared to get up there and try to make yourself look like an idiot for a little bit, who is gonna believe in it?” This March, hordes of ecstatic believers turned up at a rowdy sold-out show at Camden’s Electric Ballroom. In June, BBC tastemaker Annie Mac named the band’s 2018 single “Kutcher” Radio 1’s ‘Hottest Record in the World’ (yes, the song is indeed an extended metaphor for a relationship resembling that of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore). As of recently the band was living together in Kent, creating a WhatsApp group chat for their fans and joking about how they have more floor space on the road than at home. In October, a tour with indie rock heroes Two Door Cinema Club found Sports Team playing stadiums across the UK. That means more eyes, more ears and more bodies to respond to new music, like “The Races” and “Fishing,” which they tore up during their Artists To Watch performances. Try not to go too nuts when you blast ‘em at top volume.

Coronavirus: Why we touch our faces and how to stop it - BBC News,"Several medical officials across the world have warned people to avoid touching their face as a key way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Often when issuing the warning, they've gone on to - you guessed it - put their hands on their face.

But why do we touch our faces in the first place? And is it that easy to just stop doing it all of a sudden?

We spoke to psychologist Natasha Tiwari.

Venice Beach, which served as a US hippy hub of the 1960s, is now seeing dozens of locals cruising its boardwalk late at night with brightly glowing rides.
The bicycle enthusiasts say they fit right in with the hundreds of performers, artists and musicians that already call Venice Beach home. BBC Pop Up's Matt Danzico is off the road this month and exploring his new home in Southern California.

"Jihadist motivation in Munich attack, German prosecutors say | BBC News","An Afghan man arrested on suspicion of driving into a crowd of people in Munich has admitted carrying out the attack and appears to have had a religious motivation, German prosecutors say.
 
Munich public prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann told reporters that the suspect had said ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) in Arabic when he was detained and she described the attack as ""Islamist motivated"".
 
Police said 36 people were injured in the attack near Munich central station on Thursday, among them a two-year-old girl.

"In Southern Gaza, Patients and Displaced People Tell Their Stories","Since conflict resumed in Gaza on December 1, 2023, bombings and ground attacks have intensified in the south. Many people have taken refuge in and around Nasser Hospital, which MSF supports. Here, MSF patients tell their stories.

""I was injured in my leg, my back, and my left hand,"" one patient says. ""I had burns and flesh wounds. My mother had her hand amputated, and my little niece was killed. What have these young children done to deserve this?”

Displaced people taking refuge outside are occupied with trying to find food and water. ""We have a hard time finding bread for the kids, and if we get some we divide it to feed all the family,” one mother says. ""Other than that, [we face] difficulty in [finding] water, especially fresh water.”

There is little humanitarian aid trickling into Gaza and everything is in short supply—food, water, and medicines. MSF is calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire and the allowance of badly needed humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza.

KATSEYE - Introducing KATSEYE | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Introducing KATSEYE | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

In the year of the girl group comeback, KATSEYE stands out from the pack as the global crew. There’s Daniela, Lara, and Megan from the States. There’s Swiss singer Manon repping Europe, Sophia waving the flag for the Philippines and Yoonchae from the pop group Mecca of the past decade, South Korea. It’s a novel concept, developed via a tried and true method - a talent contest. The six gals were the finalists of The Debut: The Dream Academy. Afterwords, the real work started. “We were training 10 to 12 hours a day,” recalls Lara. They also moved in together. “We became sisters,” says Manon. Months of dance training and singing sessions culminated in the aptly titled “Debut.” A swaggering bassline matches the pop confection’s main announcement: KATSEYE is the result of detailed planning, but the energy is all natural. “We ain’t flexing, babe we do what we do.” Perhaps more impressive is second single, “Touch.” Having arrived in July, it boasts more than 170 million Spotify streams and 60 million-plus views for the whirlwind video. Those are phenomenal numbers. So much so that we had to jump in on the rapidly-ascending ground floor. That fans are going to go crazy for these performances might be the easiest prediction we'll make this year. Sitting together on the DSCVR stage, this constellation of six young stars giggled in anticipation about 2025 plans. A couple even got goosebumps, a sensation that many viewers will certainly share.

You're Gonna Need a Bigger Plenum...—Engine Masters Preview Ep. 51,"Watch the full episode on MotorTrend: https://bit.ly/35nahxe
Well, maybe. This time on Engine Masters, presented by AMSOIL, we dive into what effect changes to your intake manifold's plenum volume will have on your motor. We want to know if all of the Internet's theories about big boost, big cubes, and/or big rpm needing bigger plenum volume really hold water. Will all of that increased volume really turn into increased power production or are you just creating hood clearance headaches? Watch as we go from straight out-of-the-box to out-of-the-bounds-of-sanity with this plenum volume comparison. #EngineMasters",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tzdCWm-vwU
Covid rules ease in England as nightclubs reopen and bar service resumes - BBC News,"Most legal restrictions on social contact have been lifted in England.

Plan to strengthen gun control measure agreed by US senators - BBC News,"US campaigners have welcomed a potential cross-party deal on gun safety reforms but stressed the proposals do not go far enough.

The plans include tougher checks for buyers under the age of 21 and cracking down on illegal gun purchases.

They were announced by a cross-party group of US senators on Sunday. Crucially, the proposals are supported by 10 Republicans, meaning they have the numbers to be voted into law.

President Joe Biden also said the plans were ""steps in the right direction"" but they fell far short of what he and many Democrats have been calling for.

Caylee Hammack - Forged in the Fire (Live) | Vevo DSCVR at Home,"Caylee Hammack  - Forged in the Fire. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

Before Caylee Hammack was rockin’ stages with Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley, before she had a Top 30 country radio song with “Family Tree,” she was payin’ her dues and cuttin’ her teeth in all sorts of Nashville shows. That’s where she got her chops. But Ellaville, Georgia, with its population hovering around 2,000, is where her identity and perspectives were formed. Hammack wields the skills to make those portraits of America’s rural locales ultra-vivid - with all the ups and downs intact. “Small Town Hypocrite” is about fallin’ in love with a boy who’s a “stranger'' in a backwater burgh too, Eventually he cheats, has kids and moves in with someone else, and she ends up spiteful, and turning into someone she never wanted to be. That’s the kind of inspired songwriting that’s pushing the fiery performer to the forefront. We caught up with the rising star at Chez Hammack in Nashville, and she delivered tons of emotion with her live, at-home takes on “Small Town Hypocrite” and “Forged in the Fire.” They’re sure to transport you from your world to hers real quick.

Customize Your Shoes || 37 GENIUS SHOE HACKS EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW,"BRILLIANT SHOE IDEAS AND HACKS YOU SHOULD TRY

I’ve shown you a lot of amazing clothing that can help you upgrade your old clothes. So, in this video, I bring to you some amazing show hacks that will give some styling to your old shoes. 
If there’s a hole at the front of your old fabric/canvas shoes, you can fix it by cutting off parts of the shoe. First, cut some at the front, and then a section from the back (where your heels are) and voila. You’ve just turned them into amazing summer shoes. 
You can take an old pair of flip-flops remove the plastic part from them and replace it with some shoelaces to make a beautiful pair of lace-up sandals for the summer. 
To protect your shoes when going out, you can use a balloon. Inflate it and then press it with your shoes to deflate it. 
If you have white fabric shoes, I show you how to give them a beautiful pastel rainbow color using fabric dye and some sponges. 
Another great shoe hacks are with gems. You can take your plain old high heels and stick little jewelry gems to it to make them expensive.

Coronavirus: US unemployment claims hit 26.4 million amid virus - BBC News,"A further 4.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic continued to mount.

The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 26.4 million.

That amounts to more than 15% of the US workforce.

However, the most recent data marked the third week that the number of new claims has declined, raising hopes that the worst of the shock may be over.

""While this week's 4.4 million jobless claims are staggering, there are signs that the pace of layoffs has reached its peak,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at financial service firm Charles Schwab.

Chinese Street Food - $2 BELT NOODLES + Breakfast Dumplings in Xi’an!!,"🇨🇳 Chinese Street Food Tour in Xi'an: https://youtu.be/R4x9QJBfhXg

👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/   

Lixiangyang's Hulatang & Fried Dumpling (东新街李向阳糊辣汤) - We’re starting with a very popular Muslim breakfast stall that’s famous for dumpling buns - 4 RMB ($0.56) for 5, hulatang (hot and spicy soup) - 9 RMB ($1.26), and some of the best Chinese vegetable pockets - Price - 5 RMB ($0.70) that I’ve ever had. Breakfast was on another level! 

Three Brother's Vegetable Burger (玄风桥三兄弟菜夹馍) - Next up on this Chinese food tour today, Xi’an is famous for its Chinese burgers, often filled with meat, but this one is vegetarian and it’s so good. Price - 6 RMB ($0.86)

You can’t come to Xi’an without visiting the Xi'an City Wall. The wall has so much history and to this day the old part of the city is still surrounded by the wall.

Jing Gao - You’ll notice this unique sticky rice stick dessert all over Xi’an and it’s as tempting as it looks. The taste is actually quite nice as well, and very convenient to eat. Price - 3 RMB ($0.43) 

Shangzhai Big Bowl Noodle (南柳巷尚寨老碗面) - Easily one of the most famous of all Chinese noodles in Xi’an is Biang Biang Noodles (油泼扯面). This place is very popular, but I was a little disappointed that his place doesn’t actually hand pull their noodles, but instead slices them. That being said, they were incredibly delicious with the splashed hot chili oil on top. Price - 12 RMB ($1.71). Don’t worry, coming soon we’ll go to a place where they still hand pull their noodles. 

Wangkui's Burger (骡马市南口王魁肉夹馍) - Roujiamo (肉夹馍) is the famous Xi’an Chinese burger and this restaurant is legendary and one of the most famous. Price - 10 RMB ($1.43)

Chang'an Da Paidang (长安大排档上元灯会 葫芦鸡) - You can eat street food and noodles forever in Xi’an, but it’s also nice to sit down and eat some of the bigger main dishes of this region of Chinese food. Xi’an is famous for Gourd chicken (葫芦鸡), a whole fried chicken, and some other unique dishes. Price - 91 RMB ($12.98) total *I think they gave us a few complimentary dishes. 
 
Another outstanding day of delicious Chinese food in Xi’an, China!

Lyrics: 
A thousand generations 
Falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us 
And all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever

If you've been forgiven 
And if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom 
And if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We'll sing the song forever and amen

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever

Hear Your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all
Jesus
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all 
Above all thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever 

Hear Your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy 
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Lyrics:
I put it on God
'Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the challenges weh I face
I no deh shake, and I no deh fear
Many things deh sup, but I just put it on God
I will wait for you, do everything with you
It can be uncomfortable, so uncomfortable
When you we-be-de-cool-cool, stand attention like Popo
I go stay where you wan stay, I go go where you wan go
Them been say make I no talk
I can't be mute, I can't be silent
The pressure them turn me to diamonds
It goes sideways if its my way
I wanna go your way
Whether na money or na wahala, me I no fit to bother
I get holy father
I put it on God
'Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the challenges weh I face
I no deh shake, and I no deh fear
Many things deh sup, but I just put it on God
'Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the challenges weh I face
I no deh shake, and I no deh fear
Many things deh sup, but I just put it on God
Who else, who else can I call?
I'm in need of someone I can lean on
'Cause when everything else fails me
Mwari makandibata that I know
Ndanga ndichitsvaka an answer (ndanga ndichitsvaka)
Muri kupiko Mwari?
Ko Mwari ndoramba ndichichema (here?), ndichingochema?
Ndichitsutsumwa
I'm here to lay bare of it
I put it on God
'Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the challenges weh I face (weh I face)
I no deh shake, and I no deh fear
Many things deh sup, but I just put it on God (on God)
'Cause I know Oluwa is involved (yes, he's involved, yeah, yeah)
E no matter the challenges weh I face
I no deh shake, and I no deh fear
Many things deh sup, but I just put it on God

What If Your Fingers Were the Same Length,"Why are your fingers different lengths? And what would happen if all five fingers were of equal length? I was browsing the web the other day and took a personality test – something like “what your finger length reveals about you”. When I found out I can’t be a genius because of the way my fingers are, it made me wonder: why do your fingers have to be of different length anyway? 

It looks like evolutionary history still doesn’t have a 100% clear answer to this question. They recently found a skeleton of a guy with a lump at the base of his hand from 1.5 million years ago. It means humans possibly had hands just like we do now back then. Until then, millions of years before, their fingers were long and curved, their palms were extra broad, and their thumbs were small and weak. So, what made humans evolve and go from uniformly shaped fingers to what we have today?

Black girl 'forced out of Alabama school' - BBC News,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
The BBC is retracing one of the great civil rights journeys, the march 50 years ago from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Then the struggle was over the right to vote but many feel their struggles for equality still go on. Aleem Maqbool, who is walking the route, has been finding that one form of segregation can still be seen in modern-day Alabama. One black parent tells him about the struggles she faced when her daughter enrolled in an all-white, private school.

SUMMARY: 
- At a depth of 2.3 ft, you'll find numerous mole tunnels and rabbit warrens. By the way, a mole can dig a tunnel longer than 65 ft in just one day!  
- Deep-burrowing species of earthworms can be spotted at a depth of 10 ft. One of them, Drawida grandis, can grow up to 3.5 ft long.
- You can still find the roots of tropical forest plants if you dig 23 ft down. Tropical trees need such long roots to store water during dry periods. 
- When we arrive at a depth of 60 ft, we can see Beijing's Underground City. That's a subterranean bomb shelter consisting of a vast network of tunnels and underground rooms. It’s situated under the capital of China.
- In Cappadocia, Turkey, there's an underground complex that probably dates back to the 7th century. Its name is Derinkuyu Underground City, and it's situated almost 280 ft below Earth’s surface.
- The Channel Tunnel, connecting the UK with France, is situated at a depth of 377 ft. 
- The deepest railway tunnel is located at a depth of 787 ft. That's the maximum depth of the Seikan Tunnel in Japan that opened in 1988. 
- Even if we could get down to 1,001 ft, we’d still be in the danger zone for a B82 Earth-penetrating nuclear warhead. That's its maximum destructive depth. 
- At a depth of 3,800 ft, there's the deepest bat colony in the world. About 1,000 brown bats spend every winter in a zinc mine in New York. 
- About 5,920 ft down and we arrive at the deepest part of the 227-mile-long Grand Canyon. Its average depth is 5,282 ft. 
- The average depth of the oceanic crust is almost 20,000 ft. This is also the depth of the deepest known microbes. They were found in rocks below China's Songliao Basin. 
-The winner in the category of the deepest artificial hole on Earth is Z44-Chayvo Oil and Gas Well. This shaft is drilled down to a whopping 40,604 ft! That's 15 Burj Khalifas put on top of each other. The shaft is located in the Russian Far East.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Norwegian woman close to climbing world's 14 highest mountains in record time - BBC News,"Kristin Harila is on the verge of completing mountain climbing's most difficult challenge.

The Norwegian climber has reached the summit of 11 of the world's 14 tallest mountains - all over 8,000m (26,000ft). If Harila is able to climb the remaining three peaks by November, she will become the fastest person in the world to achieve this accomplishment.

Currently the record is held by Nepal-born British mountaineer Nirmal Purja, who climbed all 14 eight-thousanders in six months and six days.

Harila hopes to beat Purja's record to to show women's capability in the sport.

""Women are just as strong as the men are in the mountain, there's no difference between us,"" she said.

Coronavirus: Adults enjoy first outdoor exercise as Spain relaxes lockdown measures - BBC News,"Adults in Spain have crowded parks and pavements as they make the most of exercising outside for the first time in seven weeks.

Spain has some of Europe's strictest lockdown regulations, and until last week was the only country in Europe to ban children from leaving the house. There are now allocated time slots for when people are allowed to be outdoors, based on their age.

Since 14 March people in Spain have only been allowed to leave the house to buy food or medicine, to go to work if working from home was not possible, or to briefly walk the dog.

Trial to save lives of baby elephants from deadly herpes virus - BBC News,"Chester Zoo is embarking on a world-first trial of a vaccine that could save the lives of young elephants.

It’s designed to protect the animals from a common and very dangerous virus called elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus.

The disease is responsible for more than half of the deaths of Asian elephants in zoos and is a significant threat to elephants in the wild. 

It’s hoped that if the trial is successful the vaccine will be able to roll out around the world including in wild elephant populations.

Meanwhile 1990 was 30 years ago and fashion doesn't seem to have changed a lot since then. But technology is getting more and more advanced affecting different aspects of our lives, including fashion. Seamless dresses, backpacks incorporated in outfits, 3D-printed wearables.

Dutch family 'waiting for end of time' found in secret room - BBC News,"A family who spent nine years on a farm ""waiting for the end of time"" have been discovered by police in the Netherlands after one of them turned up at a local pub, reports say.

A man of 58 and six young adults aged 18 to 25 were living at a farm in the province of Drenthe.

The family were found after the eldest of the children ordered beer at a bar in the nearby village of Ruinerwold.

He then told staff he needed help, broadcaster RTV Drenthe reported.

""We found six people living in a small space in the house which could be locked but wasn't a basement,"" police said in a statement late on Tuesday.

The older man has been arrested. According to the family, he is the father of the six children, say police. It was not clear whether they had been there voluntarily, police added. The eldest son was not there at the time, police told the BBC.

Premature babies struggling for life in Ukrainian cities bombed by Russia - BBC News,"Doctors in some areas of Ukraine have begun seeing a sharp rise in the number of premature births as the conflict enters its second month.

Prenatal clinics in both Kharkiv and Lviv have told the BBC that the rate of preterm births has doubled or tripled in the past few weeks, as a result of stress and medical issues linked to the war.

Iryna Kondratova, the medical director Kharkiv's regional perinatal clinic, said premature births had jumped to three times their normal rate at her Kharkiv clinic, and now account for 50% of all deliveries.

"Tomas Kovacs, Terry Joiner - Bundle of Joy (From ""Inside Out"")","Watch Disney and Pixar’s Inside Out on Disney+ now

Don’t miss an all-new adventure with Joy, Sadness, and the rest of the Emotions when Inside Out 2 opens only in theaters this summer.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney and Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind.

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.

25 COOL DIYS AND CRAFTS TO MAKE UNDER 5 MINUTES,"GREAT WAYS TO PASS THE TIME AT HOME

In the first video section, I show you some science experiment tricks you can make that will help you understand some subjects better – such as physics and chemistry. 
On is to attach a magnet on your LEGO pieces and then place it in a bottle of water. – when you see it floating press the sides of the bottle and the Lego pieces will head right down and back up again. But if you do the same and add a few paper clips in the water. The magnet will attach to the paper clips and the piece will stay at the bottom. 
Some forms of ink are also magnetic. So, if you add some oil in your ink pigment powder and you place a few magnets on top of it, the ink will start to climb up. 
Another great trick to try is with quarts. Take a few eggshells and cover them in PVA glue, sprinkle some quarts on top of it and set it aside to dry. Then, fill a bowl with water, add food coloring, and some quartz. Place your eggshells in and see them grow crystals on them.
Watch until the end to see some awesome DIYs using a 3D pen, and how to use epoxy resin to fix all your problems and create new crafts.

"""We're suffering from thirst"": Sudanese refugees in Chad #sudanconflict","Let’s #TalkAboutSudan. At Al-Acha camp in #Chad, water is scarce. This camp in Chad is home to about 50,000 people, among more than 600,000 #refugees and returnees who have fled #Sudan since the war broke out nearly a year ago.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) water and sanitation technician, Sharaf Aldin, led us through the camp and shared the difficulties people face to secure #water. “They are waiting sometimes for two days and they are not getting water,” he said. “We are suffering from thirst.”

Our teams are working in several locations in eastern Chad, providing #maternalcare and surgical care, water and sanitation, and care for people with malnutrition, malaria, and other diseases. However, advanced efforts are needed to support this vulnerable community.

What if All People Lost Their Jobs?,"Okay - 6 A.M. Alarm. Shower. Coffee. Office. You answer emails, type a program, write, build, design, make calls. Finally – lunch!  Do you have time today? Nope, gonna have to skip again – tight deadline on that report. It's already dark outside when you head home and fall into bed, exhausted.

Work has become our existence – you’ll spend 1/3 of your life doing it. Though, that statistic is probably higher for many. But what if we take it all away? What if all the jobs just vanished one day?

SUMMARY:
-You wake up simply because you’re well rested! The weather is beautiful outside the window, you're not in a hurry, you don't need to do a single thing right now.
-You ride to the park, sit on the grass, and call your mom. You chat for hours. Then, you meet up with friends you haven’t seen for ages. 
-With nobody working at the power and water plants, you’ve lost social media, the Internet, running water, electricity and gas. 
-People are already tired of the extended vacation and don't know what to do! They’re looking for a job, any job for anybody!
-There's nobody inside now, but the place is ransacked. You can’t call the police because it doesn’t exist any more. 
-You walk out, dozens of people surround you. They offer you help in every form. Replacing wheels for apples, fixing bike chain for oil, and so on. 
-The stranger walks you to the last refuge for workaholics that pretend to be working out of habit. 
-People head to the countryside and live off the land, try to be self-sufficient. There is no more money. As for anything that resembles an economy, it’s based on trading goods and services. People start working for pleasure. 
-Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence replaces bank tellers, customer service representatives, IT specialists, even hotel receptionists – this becomes new reality.

Curbing Gun Violence: Strategies for Change,"Nearly 40,000 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S. in 2017 — the most in 20 years. And while mass shootings grab headlines, they account for a small part of gun-related murders in the country. Urban gun violence remains a tremendous —  and too often overlooked — burden on underserved communities. And suicides persist as accounting for the majority of U.S. gun deaths. As the seventh anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting approached, this Forum event examined contrasting facets of gun violence in America. Seeking to move the discussion past partisan debates, panelists grappled with ways to prevent gun violence in the most impacted communities and offer key, actionable steps that we can take now to reduce gun violence in the U.S.

This Forum event was presented jointly with HuffPost on December 11, 2019.

"The Ultimate ETHIOPIAN FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Restaurants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia!","►Go Addis Tours: http://goaddistours.com/
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Thank you to Go Addis Tours (http://goaddistours.com/) for taking me on this amazing ultimate food and market tour of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Ethiopia is one of my favorite countries in the world for food and travel, and this was my second time to visit, and I was eager to explore and eat as much as possible.

We started early, 5 am in the morning and Go Addis Tours picked me up to start at the wholesale market. Even though the city is still sleeping, Addis Mercato is buzzing from 3 am when trucks full of produce from all over Ethiopia, sell them at the market in Addis Ababa. You’ll find all the ingredients, and massive amounts, that you need to cooking Ethiopian food. It was a good warm up, to get to know some of the ingredients, before starting the day eating Ethiopian food.

We had coffee, and breakfast, both of which were excellent. Later after visiting another market, Dessie took me to his neighborhood to eat shiro wat, one of the greatest of all Ethiopian foods, a thick and rich chickpea stew. I’ve had shiro wat many times before, but never have I seen it fully prepared right in front of me. The shiro was incredibly good, piled onto a bed of injera, and we also ordered fir fir, a mashup of injera, simmered with tomato sauce and berbere.

Next we headed to a fish restaurant in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is landlocked, so all fish is freshwater. We ordered fried fish, and asa lebleb, a mixture of fish sauteed with spices and herbs. Both were excellent, but the asa lebleb was the highlight because it was so flavorful.

Next Ethiopian food meal we went to one of the longtime classic restaurants to eat one of the best platters of beyaynetu in Addis Ababa. Beyaynetu is a mix of vegetarian dishes. It was again, a delicious meal, I especially love the tomato salad there.

For our final meal of the day, and to finish off this extreme Ethiopian food tour, we went to one of the most well known and best quality meat restaurants in Addis Ababa to eat tere siga - raw meat. You are served a variety of chunks of raw beef, delicately sliced. Then you slice it into bite sized pieces on your own, wrap in injera, and dip into chili sauce before taking a bite. It’s awesome. The fried meat version is also very good.

This was an amazing day, and an amazing Ethiopian food tour in Addis Ababa. Thank you Go Addis Tours!

Rarely seen red jellyfish spotted in deep water - BBC News,"A rarely seen red jellyfish has been spotted in deep water off the coast of southern California.

Scientists from Exploration Vessel Nautilus used a remotely controlled vehicle to dive down and observe deep sea creatures.

When it doesn't have headlights shining on it, the Poralia rufescens jellyfish's red colour usually camouflages it in the water. Red light disappears as you go deeper.

On our last day with Jordan and Julianne in Quito, Ecuador, we visited a museum in the middle of the earth! We learned about the history of Ecuador and did lots of fun equator experiments that blew our mind! Including learning about how they used to create shrunken heads after people died. We ended the day with chocolate truffles at one of the world's best chocolate factories! :) 

***TRAVEL VLOG 338*** 

Music: 
First song - “Ergo” by Birocratic (http://birocratic.lnk.to/allYL)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Gabzy’s “Piano” might not be the first to tip the Italian amaretto, but his new track surely matches its taste. Every word from the Southeast Londoner goes down smooth, with just a hint of bite: “Girl, I see you/Don’t play games, I’ll read you/Follow me, I’ll lead you/Let me show you how we do.” One could be convinced that producer Lekaa Beats filtered the instruments through the amber-hued liquid. Raised by Nigerian parents, Gabzy reps a worldly vibe. For two years, he lived in the States and absorbed the country’s R&B on the radio. Mostly, the man who also goes by Mr. Malone - an “alter ego” - credits the “multicultural vibe” of Peckham, the London neighborhood where he resided the longest, with shaping his art. Music was always a first love; but his artistic career was sidetracked by his footballing talents. That was until some local rhymers caught wind of a freestyle and urged him back on course. The AyoJay fan often points to his 2019 EP, ‘Summers,’ as an artistic inflection point. It’s the project that solidified his creative partnership with American producer Melvitto. Recently Amaarae gave the duo a shoutout, joining Saweetie on the growing list of big names that have dapped up our man. Back to the Disaronno. We decided to do something a little special for the opening moments of his “Piano” performance, which opens tight on a rocks glass and decanter. Cheers to this cool glass of talent.

New York: Guardian Angels return to Central Park as crime rises - BBC News,"Back in the 1980s when New York was gripped by violent crime, the Guardian Angels were a familiar sight patrolling the city's streets and subway. For much of the last decade, however, with a police crackdown sending crime rates falling, there seemed little need for the self-styled ""citizen safety patrols"", which critics derided as vigilantes. That changed this summer as New York, along with many other US cities, saw a spike in crime rates - and especially murders - for the first time in years. Some, including the FBI Director James Comey, have talked about a ""Ferguson effect"", but the White House insists there is no evidence yet to suggest police officers are failing to fulfil their responsibilities for fear of having their actions second-guessed. Whatever the cause, the Guardian Angels' founder Curtis Sliwa says his volunteers are responding to calls from residents who no longer feel safe in parts of Central Park. The BBC joined them on patrol.

Lyrics:

Every time I tried to make it on my own
Every time I tried to stand and start to fall
All those lonely roads that I have travelled on
There was Jesus
When the life I built came crashing to the ground
When the friends I had were nowhere to be found
I couldn't see it then but I can see it now
There was Jesus

IN THE WAITING AND THE SEARCHING
IN THE HEALING AND THE HURTING
LIKE A BLESSING BURIED IN THE BROKEN PIECES
EVERY MINUTE EVERY MOMENT
OF WHERE I BEEN AND WHERE I'M GOIN
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IT
OR COULDN'T SEE IT
THERE WAS JESUS

For this man who needs amazing kind of grace
For forgiveness at a price I could not pay
I’m not perfect so I thank God every day that
There was Jesus

IN THE WAITING AND THE SEARCHING
IN THE HEALING AND THE HURTING
LIKE A BLESSING BURIED IN THE BROKEN PIECES
EVERY MINUTE EVERY MOMENT
OF WHERE I BEEN AND WHERE I'M GOIN
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IT
OR COULDN'T SEE IT
THERE WAS JESUS

On the mountain in the valleys (There was Jesus)
In the shadows of the alleys (There was Jesus)
In the fire in the flood (There was Jesus)
Always is and always was

Microbes From Smallest to Largest,"How many microbes are in the human body? Your body consists of innumerable cells, but not all of them are you, exactly. In fact, more than half of what is you are microorganisms that hitch a ride on and inside your body: the average human is home to about 40 trillion microbes against 30 trillion of their own cells. And outside your body, there are trillions of times more. 

The tiniest single-cell organism doesn’t even have a name yet. It’s 9 nanometers long — 150,000 of these critters fit on the tip of a hair. The largest single-cell organism in the world is a seaweed, and it can reach almost 10 feet in length! The world of microorganisms is amazing! Let’s take a look at what they are!

Arlo Parks - Super Sad Generation (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"Arlo Parks - Super Sad Generation - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

Arlo Parks considers herself a poet above all else. The London-based singer-songwriter spent her teenage years honing her lyrical touch at spoken-word performances. But it’s not only the likes of Rupi Kaur and Nayyirah Waheed (she professes love for both women’s poetry) that’s captured the 19-year-old’s imagination. Her erudite taste includes lots of contemporary literature and spans several musical genres. Check her nascent discography and you’ll find references to Mac Demarco’s cig preference and Gerard Way’s punk t-shirt aesthetic. Her old SoundCloud playlists are a melange of Earl Sweatshirt, EDM remixes and female Brits Little Simz and Biig Piig. As far as writing and making music, it was always just something she did in her bedroom - nothing crazy, just a hobby. But late last year she dropped “Cola,” her first single on the Beatnik label. A breakup song with crisp neo-soul production, its heartbreaking emotional tenor resonated with fans. Each release since - including last spring’s ‘Super Sad Generation’ EP - reflects an old-soul wittiness beyond the singer’s years. Openness about her bisexuality has also been an inspiration of sorts. “[Coming out] allowed me to talk about experiences and feelings I didn’t feel able to before,” she’s said. On Instagram, this King Princess fan posts collages of her own poems and pictures from her ever increasing pool of live shows. She definitely wants fans to have access to her thoughts. Check her Artists To Watch performances of “Angel’s Song” and “Super Sad Generation” and you’ll see intimacy is a priority.

Tear gas set off in Kosovo parliament - BBC News,"This is the moment when opposition politicians set off tear gas canisters in Kosovo's parliament, prompting its evacuation.
The stunt was a bid to disrupt voting on a bill to ratify a border agreement with Montenegro - paving the way to EU visa-free travel and, it is hoped, eventual EU membership.

Kosovo's MPs have ratified a 2015 border agreement with Montenegro, fulfilling a key condition for gaining visa-free travel in the European Union.
The vote went ahead despite attempts by opposition politicians to prevent it by throwing tear gas in the chamber.

Paris mayor swims in Seine to prove water clean enough for Olympics | BBC News,"Paris's mayor Anne Hidalgo has swam in the River Seine in a bid to show the water is clean enough for Olympic events.
 
Three Olympic and Paralympic events are set to be held in the Seine, including the triathlon, marathon swimming and Para-triathlon - though concerns were raised previously about the safety of the water. 
 
Swimming in the Seine has been banned for a century because of the filthy water, caused by upstream industrial sewage and sanitation demands. 
 
City swimming is set to be one of the major legacies of this summer's Olympic Games in France, with three open-air swimming areas set to be accessible from the quayside by 2025.

Ella Langley - hungover (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Ella Langley - hungover | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Excuse me, you look like you could use some Ella Langley in your life. With a voice like top-shelf whiskey splashed on an ex-lover’s shirt and set ablaze, the Alabama native has been hot on the country scene in 2024. The big spark came from her straight-out-the-saloon waltz “you look like you love me.” The flirty duet with Riley Green is country music at its best: sparkling piano and slide guitars, wry lyricism, and an imperfect romance. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 over the summer. The subsequent arrival of her ‘hungover’ album proved that where there’s smoke there’s fire. Tracks such as the simmering power ballad “nicotine” and rollicking “better be tough” recall the outlaw versatility of Miranda Lambert and pop capabilities of Kacey Musgraves. A couple years back, Ella moved from Hope Hull (pop. 4,000) to the Mecca of music, Nashville, where she paid dues at bars, honkytonks, and local festivals. Word spread about her ‘Excuse The Mess’ EP, and soon opening slot invites were rolling in from Jon Pardi, HARDY, Morgan Wallen and Luke Bryan. At the end of the day, however, Ella only needs Ella. “Hate to break your buckle, baby, you ain’t the only John Wayne here,” she warns on “cowboy friends.” “In the spur of the moment, some other boots could buy me a beer.” A little bit like the hair of the dog, Ella and her band cured all our nerves during her Artists To Watch shoot. “hungover” and “weren’t for the wind” came out sounding rich and fiery. Easy to knock back, with just the right amount of bite.

Man in Joker costume injures 17 in Tokyo attack - BBC News,"A 24-year-old man wearing a Joker costume attacked passengers on a Tokyo train line on Sunday evening.

As many as 17 people were injured as they headed for Halloween parties in the city.

Witnesses say the suspect was wearing a green shirt and purple suit.

He sprayed a clear liquid around the carriage and set it alight. Video footage showed passengers running through carriages away from the flames while others clambered through windows.

""I thought it was a Halloween stunt,"" one witness told the Yomiuri newspaper about the attack. ""Then, I saw a man walking this way, slowly waving a long knife.""

"Yes, You Can Mess Up Making Tea","Making tea seems straightforward, but there are common mistakes that can affect the flavor. One key blunder is using water that's too hot, which can make your tea bitter. You should also pay attention to the steeping time; oversteeping can result in a too-strong or bitter brew. Not using enough tea leaves or tea bags can lead to a weak, flavorless cup. And don't forget to cover your tea while it steeps to trap those aromatic compounds. Lastly, be mindful of the type of tea and its ideal brewing conditions, as different teas have different requirements. So, making a perfect cup of tea takes a little more attention to detail than we might have thought!

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

LYRICS:
Move through the room, fading too soon
Small talk is old
Do as you’re told, act like you’re listening
Where is the home, that I used to know?
Seems like we’ve changed, you’re watching me like there’s nothing different

Familiar faces in the same old places
Can you see I’m changing?
I’m feeling distant, I hate the feeling

Small towns never held me
I’m more than sidewalk routine
Take me to the city
Never bought suburbia dreams
Here I’ve got nothing to prove – Suburbia Blue
Nothing to win or to lose – I’m fine without you

Got on a plane, dreaming of fame
Listening to them, convincing me that I've got no limits
I rode the high, got drunk on a dream
Seems like I’ve changed, you’re watching me like I'm something different

Strangers faces, unfamiliar places
I’m no one to them, but I could be something - I love the feeling

Small towns never held me
I’m more than sidewalk routine
Take me to the city
Never bought suburbia dreams
Here I’ve got nothing to prove – Suburbia Blue
Nothing to win or to lose – I’m fine without you

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

NSG - Natural Disaster (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2020,"NSG - Natural Disaster - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Picture the vibe of NSG by thinking about your childhood squad of neighborhood friends who used to bounce around causing minor acts of mischief. In the case of the UK hip-hop crew, they *allegedly* pranked fans into thinking Drake might feature on an upcoming single. Naughty stuff, indeed. The song in question was “Options,” which earlier this year became NSG’s first track to break into the UK Top Ten. Turns out the six-member outfit didn’t need Aubrey’s help this time around. Hailing from London’s Hackney borough, most of the members - NSG is made up of Papii Abz, Dope, Kruddz, Mxjib, Mojo and OGD - met at school in nearby Islington. A bit of mystery surrounds the meaning of their acronym moniker, but popular theories include “Never Stop Grinding,” “Nonstop Goals,” and “Nigerian Slash Ghanaian.” The latter appellation refers to the group’s roots breakdown - each of the members hails from one of the two African countries. As for ambitions? “Stadiums around the world are the dream,” Kruddz told a journalist, and they've also said they'd love to take a shot at Coachella stage someday. For the record, don't label what goes down on their records as only Afroswing; NSG like to dodge genre associations and view themselves as a little bit of everything: Afro-basement, Afrobeat, Latin and dancehall rolled into an ever-changing mix. You can call ‘em global sound. “People say NSG look like a K-Pop band,” Kruddz has joked. “That’s so big at the moment, we can be the African version, A-Pop!” The guys certainly have the requisite dance moves for a viral bid - see: “Trust Issues,” which, along with last year’s “Natural Disaster,” they performed for Artists to Watch. With their cheeky social media game - where they consistently repost fans’ NSG-inspired choreography - and a consistent stream of new bangers, we fully agree that they’re closer to world domination than their newcomer status would have you believe. See you in Indio?

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Race and Policing: State and Local Perspectives,"Building on two previous Forums about race, criminal justice and health (from February 2015 and October 2015), this event examined specific approaches and models to address the complexities of race and policing. Experts in law enforcement, public health, community relations and the law spoke. Subjects included safeguarding law enforcement and communities, promoting more effective communication and de-escalation techniques, and narrowing the social, economic and health gaps that persist between underserved and middle-class America. The emphasis was on local and state approaches.

This event was presented jointly with PRI's The World & WGBH on March 27, 2017.

Kylie Morgan - Cuss A Little (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2021,"Kylie Morgan - Cuss A Little | An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2021, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

When we were discussing Kylie Morgan for inclusion in Artists To Watch 2021, someone said sure, her voice and songcraft were a great one-two punch, but more importantly her personality was irresistible. Quite correct. Long story short, Morgan is a charmer. You can tell by the way that personality strengthens her tunes. From “Boys Girl” to “Break Things,” there’s a big dose of charisma fueling the music. Her co-conspirator Shane McAnally - a veteran tunesmith with plenty of hits - has said he recognized a certain “sound” that Morgan exudes, and he’s not talkin’ about the way she tunes her guitar. He’s talkin’ personal essence. You can see it leaping from the “Break Things” video as she strolls down the sidewalk issuing a warning: she ain’t afraid to come on strong. Maybe this self-assurance springs from the focus that Morgan’s had since her Oklahoma childhood. At 12 she told her mom she wanted to be a country singer, and the family said sure, go for it. The process began: karaoke concerts, regional festivals, and at 15, the start of several forays into Music City. After-school writing sessions in her bedroom honed her way with words, one of her current strong suits. Recognition from E! TV’s ‘Opening Act,’ trickled into the CMA’s ‘Who New To Watch’ into CMT’s ‘Next Women of Country.’ When people hear her, they like her. That was proven on opening slots for Kip Moore and others. These days the 25-year-old is amped to have more of her music heard. Recent tracks remind that she has a way of catering to the renegade side of things. “I feel like a lot of girls haven’t been able to have those songs that they think ‘that’s me,’” she’s said.  Once a gymnast, Morgan is now a yoga instructor (check her yoga faves playlist on Spotify) leading a ‘Namaste at Home’ class during these pandemic months. Her ATW 2021 romp through “SHOULDA” and “Cuss a Little” has all that flair her fans love. Bet you hear what they hear.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Electromagnetic Spectrum,"What are the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice break down visible light, the different wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum, and the discoveries that uncovered it.

Neil explains a revelation he had about potatoes and how its sort of like the electromagnetic spectrum. Is everything light?

"Travellers to England could face £10,000 fines or prison for breaking quarantine rules - BBC News","The UK government has unveiled tough new quarantine measures  for anyone arriving in England from outside the UK, including fines and even prison terms for people who break the rules. 

The measures are designed to keep coronavirus variants out of the country. 

All travellers are required to have a negative covid test before they travel and isolate for ten days once they arrive while undergoing coronavirus tests. 

People arriving from  33 countries on the government's “red list” will be taken to hotels where they have to stay for 10 days at a cost of  £1,750.

If people violate the rules they could face £10,000 fines and potentially up to 10 years in prison.

Scores feared drowned in shipwreck off Libya - BBC News,"Up to 150 people may have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya, the UN refugee agency says.
A further 150 people were rescued by fishermen and returned to Libya by coastguards, the UNHCR said.
It is not clear if the migrants were on one or two boats that left the Libyan town of al Khoms, some 120km (74.5 miles) east of Tripoli.
If confirmed, it would be the deadliest shipwreck in the Mediterranean so far this year.

What Will Happen to Your Body If You Walk Every Day,"Walking is a totally free, easy exercise that requires little effort, and benefits not only your physical but also your mental well-being. If you’re looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. 
People who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that’s because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   
A daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. 
Muscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don’t break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn’t require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.
The Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.
A group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.
If you still don’t feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn’t mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.

SUMMARY
-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.
-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. 
-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.
-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. 
-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.
-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.
-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.
-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.
-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.
-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.
-Keep in mind the FIT formula. It stands for Frequency (how often), Intensity (how fast), and Time (for how long).

India heatwave leaves millions struggling to cope - BBC News,"Millions of Indians are experiencing a brutal heatwave that is throwing lives and livelihoods out of gear. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi told state chief ministers: ""Temperatures are rising rapidly in the country, and rising much earlier than usual.""

This week, the mercury in the capital, Delhi, is expected to cross 44C (111.2 F). 

The India Meteorological Department has forecast a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by 2-4C (35.6- 39.2F) over most parts of north-western and central India this week, with ""no large change thereafter"".

While heatwaves are common in India, summer began early this year in March, with the highest average temperatures in 122 years. Heatwaves also began setting in during the month.

Former Trump employee: 'I would not vote for him' - BBC News,"A woman who worked for Donald Trump as the chief engineer on Trump towers has said she ""certainly would not vote for him for President"". Barbara Res, who is often mentioned by Mr Trump in his stump speeches, said she found his policies ""abhorrent"". ""I don't think he has the temperament to be President, I think he's very impatient, I don't think that he takes advice from people,"" she added. Ms Res said in a World Service documentary, Donald Trump: The People's Billionaire, that she fell out with Mr Trump after writing a book about her time as his employee, but before that they had had ""a good relationship"" and he was ""a smart guy"".

One of the things the Trump candidacy has done is tear apart the Republican party - which some Republicans see as a very good thing.  Among them Carl Palliadino who is a former party candidate to be Governor of New York.  Mr Pallidino sees Donald Trump as a breath of fresh air

What If We Could See Infrared and Ultraviolet,"If we could see in both infrared and ultraviolet, our world would be a kaleidoscope of colors beyond imagination. Infrared vision would let us detect heat signatures, making it easier to spot hidden animals or even sense temperature variations. Ultraviolet vision would reveal patterns and markings on flowers that guide pollinators, unveiling a whole new layer of beauty. But these enhanced abilities might come with some drawbacks, like being overwhelmed by the additional visual information. Plus, it could potentially expose us to harmful radiation since both ultraviolet and infrared rays are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s 

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

33 GENIUS HACKS YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEEDED,"GENIUS HACKS 

Here are some pretty important hacks for those who are moving out or want to rearrange furniture a bit!

Moving and lifting straps (Shoulder Dolly, shown in this video, is one type). It takes the weight off your back by relying on leverage and large muscle groups. They also leave your hands free to maneuver awkward items. However, they can be tricky to use on stairs because the weight shifts completely to the downhill mover.
Let's find out how to make them!

Or you may wanna go for lifting straps that can be adjusted for different-length objects as well as for different-size movers. The Forearm Lifting and Moving Straps are great for moving on flat surfaces.

Severe flooding hits Spain's east coast after record rainfall - BBC News,"A massive clean-up operation is under way in the Spanish city of Valencia after record-breaking rainfall.

Dozens of cars were submerged as floodwater surged through neighbourhoods of the city, leaving homes and businesses waterlogged.

The severe weather forced authorities to close the city's metro system and several roads, and a team of ambulance workers had to be rescued from their vehicles.

The nearby regions of Alicante and Castellón were also badly affected.

Lyrics:
I shouldn’t be alive 
My future was six feet under 
One foot in the grave 
No hope to be saved 
I shouldn’t be alive 
But I’m a miracle child 
Defied every diagnosis 
And as close as it came 
I can stand here and say 
I’m a miracle child 

Death where is your sting 
My savior’s word is final 
I am resurrected 
Blood protected 
I am a miracle child 

If you’re facing the odds 
If you think you’re beyond His saving 
There’s no life He can’t raise 
No, your wounds aren’t too great 
He’s a miracle God 

‘Cause He shouldn’t be alive 
His body was six feet under 
Three days in the grave 
But that stone rolled away 
Yeah, our God is alive

Death where is your sting 
My savior’s word is final 
I am resurrected 
Blood protected 
I am a miracle child 

Oh, death where is your sting 
My savior’s word is final 
I am resurrected 
Blood protected 
I am a miracle child 


You’re the living breathing God of glory 
I’m a living breathing testimony 
You’re the one who turns a  
Dead end story  
To a living breathing testimony 

You’re the living breathing God of glory 
I’m a living breathing testimony 
You’re the one who turns a  
Dead end story  
To a living breathing testimony 


Death where is your sting 
‘Cause my savior’s word is final 
I am resurrected 
Blood protected 
I am a miracle child 

Oh, death where is your sting 
My savior’s word is final 
I am resurrected 
Blood protected 
I am a miracle child 

I’ve been crucified 
Raised with Christ 
I am a miracle child

 Lyrics:
 [Verse 1]
 Don't you think that it's boring, how people talk?
 Making smart with their words again, well, I'm bored
 Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
 Never not chasin' a million things I want
 And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
 Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
 But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)
 
 [Chorus]
 Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
 It's a new art form, showing people how little we care (Yeah)
 We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
 Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 
 [Verse 2]
 Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
 I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
 But my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
 How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?
 And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
 Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
 But I know it's not forever (Yeah)
 
 [Chorus]
 Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
 It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
 We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
 Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 
 [Bridge]
 It looked all right in the pictures (Yeah)
 Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it? (Yeah)
 I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)
 And you can watch from your window (Yeah)
 And you can watch from your window
 
 [Chorus]
 Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
 It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
 We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
 Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 
 [Outro]
 And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
 Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PdILZ_1P74

Being healthy is very important. And your ability to cure minor diseases at home at the early stages is equally important!

So let's start with the easy and yummy recipe for cough drops. You're gonna need some sugar, water, honey, lemon juice, ginger and cloves. Put these ingredients together into a pot, make it boil, then lay out in little circles on the baking sheet or tray. Let it cool down. When drops take needed shape, sprinkle it with the powdered sugar.

I'll also show you how to cure congestion, cold sore, sore throat, cough and common cold at the early stages.

Also find out how to apply band-aids and elastic bandages correctly. How to create an arm sling in case of arm injury, cure the minor cuts using vaseline and bruises as fast as possible, securely fix an open wound, make gauze bandage, get rid of migraine and whatnot!Stay safe and sound!

ACUPRESSURE POINTS

This time I'll show you how to treat different diseases through activating certain acupressure points!

The best thing about home cures is they're both easy to make and effective.
If you happen to burn your neck with a curling iron just put some toothpaste over it will soothe the burn.

If your ear blocked with ear wax, use ear candle it'll help.

If you need to prevent black eye appearence, do the following: pour half a cup of rubbing alcohol, add one cup of dish soap, put it in a plastic bad, let freeze. And when it's ready apply to bruised spot.
When you have a headache you can simply hold a pencil with your teeth. It helps to relax your jaw muscle and therefore reduces the pain!

In case you're struggling with mosquitoes: cut couple of lemons in halves and put cloves in them. Place them on your night stand and forget about the nasty mosquitoes.

Easy way to get rid of the toothache. Mix some salt, pepper and water in a bowl. Put this mixture on a cotton pad, apply to your tooth and wait 2 minutes.

Also find out how to apply band-aids and elastic bandages correctly. How to create an arm sling in case of arm injury, cure the minor cuts using vaseline and bruises as fast as possible, securely fix an open wound, make gauze bandage, get rid of migraine and whatnot!Stay safe and sound!

Shuai Gu relieves pain in the temporal region, relieves eye fatigue.

I highly recommend to try 'finger yoga', one of my favorite practices! Mudras can help you get rid of problems with memory and concentration. Deal with surplus of water and tears in the organism. Heal sickness of the ears and hearing. Get rid of throat pains, swallowing and voice problems. Help with weak immunity and loss of strenth. Deal with body polution.

Dear Silas - Under My Feet (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Dear Silas - “Under My Feet” Live Performance | Vevo

In Dear Silas' young career, the Jackson, Mississippi rapper already caught a wave or two as the beneficiary of an LOL moment going viral. Most recently, his “Skrr Skrr” soundtracked a 'Dexter Laboratory' meme. But Dear Silas is no joke, and neither is his music. With a smooth delivery and quick wit, Silas Stapleton's projects, ‘The Last Cherry Blossom’ and ‘The Day I Died,' have gained a devoted following. The former is expected to be re-packaged and re-released as a part of Dear Silas' new pact with RCA Records. Check him out on the Vevo set, where he was tapped as our latest DSCVR act and delivered moody takes on “Skrr Skrr” and “Under My Feet.”

Labour to back early general election - BBC News,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says his party will support an early general election as the government makes its pitch for a poll on 12 December.

Mr Corbyn said his condition of taking a no-deal Brexit off the table had ""now been met"" after the EU agreed to extend the deadline to 31 January 2020.

But he did not explicitly say if he would back the government's bill in Parliament later.

The SNP and Liberal Democrats are calling for an election on 9 December.

The two parties say it would prevent Boris Johnson from pushing his Brexit plan through Parliament before a poll.

The government bill published ahead of the Commons debate on an early election still states 12 December - but No 10 sources have told the BBC they would accept an election on 11 December to get opposition parties on-board.

35 CLEVER CAMPING HACKS,"CAMPING HACKS

Summer is the ultimate camping and traveling time. And I want to help you make this time most comfortable and fun possible with these hacks.

I often faced this problem on the beach. When you need to take off your swimming panties wet from the water but all dressing booths are occupied and you're in a hurry, no time to wait. I got you! Check out the way to take off your panties without taking your shorts or pants off.

Take your scissors and cut them on the both sides. Then sew 2 swimming bra locks on the cut edges of your bikini accordingly. Voila! Now all you need to do next time you're on the beach is unlock these locks and remove your panties with a mere flick of your wrist. ;)

Simple and genius way to deal with sweat - take off your bra and apply 1 hygienic pad to each bra cup.
Another handy hack is trash sorting. Here's how you do it. Take a trash bucket, then add 3 bags of different colors. Keep them together using 4 clothing pegs.

If you need to go out light, hands free but don't know where to put your keys at, I've got an idea. Make a shoelace key holder. It's very neat. You can run or jump or just walk fast and nothing will happen with the key.

If you like to make lunch breaks or brunches with your friends in the open air, here's an idea for a foil dinnerware. Take a piece of foil and wrap it round the bowl or can, any vessel of needed volume. Then take a foil of, it'll have the form of your bowl, now you can use it as usual.

Did you know that you can use a condom as a fire starter? Now you do! Check out the details in the video! ;)

Inside Bangkok's abandoned department store - BBC News,"Few cities can rival Bangkok’s chaotic and colourful mix of modernity and tradition. Largely unplanned, the Thai capital dazzles visitors with its fast and furious pace, and its dizzying variety of architectural styles.

But the city’s galloping development has left some ugly eyesores in the form of abandoned buildings, some of which are in prime locations.

One derelict department store, though, has attracted the interest of a group of artists and architects, who have turned it into an art and light exhibit.

Lyrics: 
There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
There’s honey in the rock
 
Praying for a miracle
Thirsty for the Living Well
Only You can satisfy
 
Sweetness at the mercy seat
Now I’ve tasted, it’s not hard to see
Only You can satisfy
 
There’s honey in the rock
 
Freedom where the Spirit is
Bounty in the wilderness
You will always satisfy
 
There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
 
There’s honey in the rock
Purpose in Your plan
Power in the blood
Healing in Your hands
Started flowing when You said it is done
Everything You did’s enough
 
I keep looking
I keep finding
You keep giving
Keep providing
I have all that I need
You are all that I need
 
I keep praying
You keep moving
I keep praising
You keep proving
I have all that I need
You are all that I need
 
There’s honey in the rock
Water in the stone
Manna on the ground
No matter where I go
I don’t need to worry
Now that I know
Everything I need You’ve got
 
There’s honey in the rock
Purpose in Your plan
Power in the blood
Healing in Your hands
Started flowing when You said it is done
Jesus, who You are is enough
There’s honey in the rock
 
Oh how sweet
How sweet it is
To trust in You Jesus

And why does it always start with Sputnik? David answers all those questions and more while explaining how everything came to be.

What Has Made the Earth So Hot,"Our lovely climate – from tropical to polar, arid to damp, and all that “just-right” temperate in between. It comes in all flavors, and it’s been constantly changing since the very birth of our planet Earth… So, guys, if you're brave enough, I wanna take you on a journey to the past to find out what was the Earth climate like before! 

So far, all I know is that everything was completely different in the old days. For example, 4.5 billion years ago it was super hot and molten all over. You could see the entire oceans of magma everywhere. And it took almost a billion years for our planet to take its solid form...

SUMMARY:
- It did just that 3.8 billion years ago! The rain came from those clouds over there, the first ones in the history of Earth. They form because the planet eventually began to cool down, allowing water to go from a gas to liquid state! 
- Around 2.5 billion years ago, the Huronian glaciation starts. As oxygen fills the atmosphere and replaces methane, it can’t trap heat as well.
- 2 billion years ago, the ozone layer starts to form. It not only protects the planet from the sun’s harmful radiation, it also warms this planet up a bit! 
- About 200 million years ago, dinosaurs appear, and they’ll rule the planet for the next 175 million years. 
- From 100 to 65 million years ago, the planet goes through so many changes. The single landmass is breaking apart into the continents we have today.
- 55 million years ago, something similar to today's global warming trend takes place. 
- For the next 2 million years, life on Earth is like a rollercoaster with temperatures going up into a hothouse and down into ice age.
- Ah, made it to the Ice Age that started 2.5 million years ago. The average temperature is about 12 degrees colder than it is today.
- Now, the Holocene is the name of the current geological epoch. It started 11,700 years ago. What’s that dripping on my head? Oh yeah, ice sheets in North America and Europe start melting at this time. 
- Between 7,500 and 3,500 BCE, the latest African Humid Period ends. What was recently a lush oasis in the Sahara now becomes the arid desert we know today. 
- I wonder what’s going on in America at this point? In 3,000 BCE, the western part of the present U.S. is going through some big changes.  
- It doesn’t get any warmer in the Iron Age Cold Epoch lasting from 900 to 300 BCE. Hey, they called it “cold” for a reason!
-  In the year 535, another volcanic eruption, this time in the tropics, causes another crazy temperature drop.
- The Little Ice Age starts somewhere around 1300 and goes on till 1850. It’s called “little” because it isn’t exactly as extreme as the previous ones. But, still, some intervals of it are pretty tough! 
- A lot of things happen in the world since 1850. But in climate history, it’s all been pretty stable so far. But I’m sure you’ve heard that it’s going on the warmer end.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UV3VHhAbgc

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.

A Trip to Pahurat (พาหุรัด) - Bangkok's Little India,"Visit my website for lots for travel and food, click here: 
http://migrationology.com/

Pahurat (พาหุรัด), located just a five minute walk from Yaowarat Chinatown in Bangkok, Thailand, is the Little India of Thailand. Though it's a small area, Pahurat is packed with all kinds of interesting Indian merchandise, textiles, cloth, and a few reputable Indian restaurants.

Though I haven't yet been to India (I would love to go soon), I sometimes go to Pahurat (พาหุรัด) to explore and of course dine of delicious Indian food.

In this video after doing a little walking around and checking out the area, I went over to one of my favorite street side Indian restaurants in Bangkok - a small eatery known as Toney Restaurant.

Indian food in Bangkok is not normally overly cheap, in fact it's been marketed as quite an expensive cuisine and often housed in nicer sit down restaurants. However, Pahurat (พาหุรัด), there is plenty of Indian food available and many things are quite a bit cheaper than other Indian restaurants in town.

So next time you visit Bangkok, be sure to stop by Pahurat for street food and exploration!

SUMMARY
- Here is the trick: try to cut a shape which resembles a “Christmas tree” on the match. When you light its head, the chips you got will go on fire. 
- All it takes is 1 pound of salt and 0.5 pounds of ammonia. Mix them with two liters of water. Throw this mixture into the fire. There you go! 
- Make two identical wedges on both sides of the tree. Pull the tree with a rope in the direction where you want it to fall.
- Put some potassium on the tip of the cigarette and touch it with a piece of ice. 
- You don’t need a fridge or a special container for this according to the cards. To keep the eggs fresh for a long time, dip them in salt and put them in a dry place.
- Fill a large container with water and put it somewhere above the plants. Take a woolen rope and put one end into the container, and the second one into the pot. 
- You can get the purest water from a zinc bucket with a hole at the bottom for draining. Put fine sand, coarse sand, clean and spent gravel and stones in layers on the bottom. 
- Cut a snowflake shape in a square sheet of paper. Bend off the petals you get, and place the container in there.
- Put on dry gloves or take any insulated object (a piece of cloth, clothing, etc.) and pull the poor victim by his or her clothes. 
- Tie one end of a solid rope to a tree. Make one scout swim across the river and attach the other end to the tree on the opposite side. Make a seat or something like that, attach it to a loop that can move freely along the rope. Using light cable scouts will safely take everyone who can’t swim to the other side of the river.
- Take a usual medium-sized plastic bag, put it on the table and put a brick on it. Place the open end of the bag in your mouth and start blowing into it. 
- Take a piece of wire and twist it around a pencil on one end. Sharpen the other end of the wire to use it as the point leg of a pair of compasses. You can bend the wire and adjust the pencil to get any circle size you want. 
- Take a piece of paper and a pencil and never take the pencil off that piece of paper. Keep drawing the infinity symbols as you see in the card. 
- In case you were unlucky and did run into that monster, you can use ""a scout's staff, a walking-stick, or even a handkerchief or hat” to protect yourself, as the card suggests. Put the selected item on one end of the stick, hold it between you and the dog. 
- To cook potatoes like a chef, add a pinch of sugar, not only salt when boiling. Once they are boiled, pour the water away and put the saucepan back on the stove for a short time. Shake the potatoes to make them equally dry.  
- Hold the jug straight and keep your thumb inside when carrying it. This will prevent the weight from pulling the jug down, the card said. 
- Put the knife in boiling water for 10-15 seconds, then take out and slowly slice the bread. 
- Say goodbye to annoying splinters. Fill a small bottle with hot water almost to the brim and press it firmly against the arm. The water will slowly cool down and suck up your skin. After a while, you will be able to remove the splinter easily.

22 COOL SAND IDEAS,"TRUE MAGIC OF SAND ART

Sand art is a very popular kind of art now and has different variations: you can create amazing patterns, using your hands and fine clean sand, create pictures from color sand with kids or use sticks to make pictures on a lightbox.
Today you will see the wonderful tutorial on how to make meditative patterns with swirls, flowers, petals. These patterns are also called mandalas. They are so easy to make; this process allows you to be creative and use your imagination as there are no strict rules like we have in classical drawing. You usually start from the central part and usually, it’s a point or circle and continues with any symmetrical patterns or images you like. The main idea here is true self-expression. The process of creating a mandala is a form of meditation, stress relieving practice and also helps to start thinking out of the box. Moreover, playing with sand is so relaxing and develops kinesthetic feelings. 
It’s a very inexpensive hobby that all your family will appreciate and you can spend evenings creating new patterns and boost your creativity.
Another cool idea is to make DIY colored kinetic sand at home. It’s really easy: boric acid, 4 tsp.; office glue, 2 tsp.; coloring 1 tsp, san, 100 g. Your kids can spend hours with fun playing with kinetic sand. They can create anything the like without the mess. 
Take semolina and coloring to create amazing pictures using a lightbox. Place lights inside the white plastic box and use it as a canvas. This technique is perfect for toddlers and absolutely safe. Now tour kids will be very busy creating masterpieces!

Olympics high jump gold medallist says why he shared podium - BBC News,"An incredible Olympic high jump final ended with both Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim and Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi taking gold medals.

After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37 metres.

The athletes were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off. But in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title, sparking huge celebrations.

Both had three failures as they attempted to match the Olympic record of 2.39m and, with error-free records on countback, could have fought for sole possession of the title.

Instead, they made history - it was the first joint Olympic podium in athletics since 1912.

Humpback whales enter crocodile river 'in Australian first' - BBC News,"Australian officials say they will try to guide a humpback whale out of a crocodile-infested river in the Northern Territory after it got lost and ended up 30km (18.5 miles) inland.

The whale and others were on an annual sea migration when some of them ""took a wrong turn"", experts believe.
Two whales were later able to swim out of the river, but at least one remains.

It's the first known instance of a whale being found in crocodile territory so far inland in Australia.

Given its estimated 16m (52 ft) length, the humpback is considered unlikely to be disturbed by crocodiles.
But that risk could escalate if the whale were to become stranded in the shallow waters, officials said on Monday.

What If You Woke Up During Surgery,"It's normal to feel nervous if you're about to undergo an operation. Unfortunately, numerous urban legends exist about how things can go wrong during surgery. Such myths don't have any grounds, but they can escalate your anxiety. One such fear makes people wonder what will happen if they wake up when an operation is in progress. 

People usually receive general anesthesia before major surgery. It relaxes muscles and puts patients to sleep. Therefore, nobody feels the pain of the operation. Waking up during surgery is called anesthesia awareness, and it is an extremely rare occurrence. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, only one person out of 10,000 wakes up from general anesthesia before an operation is finished. And if we speak about high-risk surgeries, this number drops to one in 40,000 patients.

#anesthesiaawareness #wakingupduringsurgery

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- People usually receive general anesthesia before major surgery. It relaxes muscles and puts patients to sleep. Therefore, nobody feels the pain of the operation.
- Waking up during surgery doesn't mean excruciating pain combined with paralysis. In a few reported cases of anesthesia awareness, patients could recognize that something was happening around them.
- The chances of waking up during surgery are minuscule. Your anesthesiologist is present throughout the whole procedure, and if something unusual happens, they will take care of this unexpected development.
- Particular types of surgeries may raise the risk of awareness. Such surgeries are mostly emergency operations after a serious injury, emergency C-sections, and some types of heart surgery. 
- Many people are worried that when they're receiving anesthesia, they will blurt out things they may regret later. This fear has no grounds. Patients do feel more relaxed under anesthetic, but they don't reveal anything unusual.
- Diethyl ether not only made patients aggressive but also evoked severe nausea and vomiting. That's why it was replaced with improved forms of anesthetics as soon as they were developed.  
- Most people describe being under anesthesia as a blackout. They report falling asleep and then waking up — seemingly a couple of minutes later. This means that even if they were dreaming, they don't remember anything at all. 
- Researchers from the University of Michigan figured out that some surgeons prescribe a greater allowance of medication than some patients end up using.
- Some people believe that they will be able to see the “afterworld” when they are under anesthesia, just like people who have experienced clinical death. But the notions of being under anesthesia and experiencing clinical death are as far from each other as they can be.

Letra de «De Qué Me Sirve la Vida»

Estoy a punto de emprender un viaje
Con rumbo hacia lo desconocido
No sé si algún día vuelva a verte
No es fácil aceptar haber perdido

Por más que suplique, no me abandones
Dijiste, no soy yo, es el destino
Entonces entendí que, aunque te amaba
Tenía que elegir otro camino

De qué me sirve la vida
Si eres lo que yo pido
Los recuerdos no me alcanzan
Pero me mantienen vivo

De qué me sirve la vida
Si no la vivo contigo
De que me sirve la esperanza
Si es lo último que muere
Y sin ti ya la he perdido

Escucha bien amor lo que te digo
Pues creo no habrá otra ocasión
Para decirte que no me arrepiento
De haberte entregado el corazón

http://www.coveralia.com/letras/de-que-me-sirve-la-vida-camila.php
Por más que suplique, no me abandones 
Dijiste, no soy yo, es el destino 
Y entonces entendí que, aunque te amaba 
Tenía que elegir otro camino. 

De que me sirve la vida 
Si eres lo que yo pido, 
Los recuerdos no me alcanzan 
Pero me mantienen vivo. 

De que me sirve la vida 
Si no la vivo contigo 
De que me sirve la esperanza 
Si es lo último que muere 
Y sin ti ya la he perdido. 

De que me sirve la vida 
Si eres lo que yo pido, 
Los recuerdos no me alcanzan 
Pero me mantienen vivo. 

De que me sirve la vida 
De que me sirve la esperanza 
Si es lo último que muere 
Y sin ti ya la he perdido.

Brexit: May statement on future votes and Article 50 extension - BBC News,"Theresa May has promised MPs a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU or ruling out a no-deal Brexit, if they reject her deal next month.

Mrs May is making a statement to MPs on Brexit, amid the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers.

The prime minister promised MPs a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of trying to ""string"" the Brexit process out.

Theresa May tells MPs she does not want to extend Article 50 but MPs will get to vote on a ""short, limited"" delay to Brexit if they reject her deal and a no-deal exit.

Addressing the Commons, the prime minister set out a new timetable with a second meaningful vote to be held by 12 March, and if that is defeated, MPs will be asked if they support leaving the EU without a deal.

She told MPs the UK will only leave the EU with no deal if ""there is explicit consent for that outcome.""",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z9fvSbcLgg

"Lolo Zouaï - ""High Highs to Low Lows"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Lolo Zouaï - High Highs To Low Lows (Vevo DSCVR) 

Make a playlist of Lolo Zouaï's music videos and you'll enjoy an extended mood that moves from poetic, reflective and chill to sensual, hurt and proud. Zouaï’s future-slanted R&B is addictive, flexing its way through a parade of vibes. The blend of the Paris-born singer’s French-Algerian roots and current Brooklyn POV gives her sultry tracks the kind of cosmopolitan feel that juiced her Blood Orange collab, “Jade,"" and fuels the steamy candor of ""Ride."" As a Bay-area teen, Lolo absorbed music and penned lyrics on Ocean Beach - skills that later earned her songwriting credits on H.E.R.'s Grammy-winning debut. Our newest DSCVR artist is one of those musicians whose essence is palpable in performance - you instantly feel like you're on her wavelength. The 24-year-old hit the Vevo studios and captivated everyone with the title track from her 'High Highs To Low Lows' debut.

-    You can curl your hair using a plastic bottle in case if you don’t have a curling iron. You will need a bottle and a hair dryer. WORKS!
-    Check out a cool trick with a lit candle in a bottle vase with water. You can amaze your friends with this trick
-    Graphite turns into a diamond in a microwave and we check this trick. DOESN’T WORK!

-    If you put a stone into a microwave, it will break. DOESN’T WORK!
-    Another lifehack that we have found says that hairspray can plump your lips. No, it’s not true!
-    If you place a boiled egg into a glass with coca cola, an egg will be dark inside after a day. Doesn’t work!
-    You can cut a watermelon using dental floss. WORKS!
-    We tried to erase the permanent marker from the wood with sanitizer and it WORKS!
-    We found OUT that you can use lemon juice to erase highlighter and checked this lifehack. So, you will need lemon juice and a cotton swab. We tested and it WORKS!

Tesla Opens its Superchargers and Weird MWC Gadgets?,"This week Tesla opened up a few of its chargers to non-Tesla EV's so, of course, Marques had to test it out.

Indonesia: How motorbikes aid Ramadan fast-breakers - BBC News,"Mobilising motorcycle taxis for food delivery is giving people In Indonesia more options to break their fast. Muslims around the world are halfway through the fasting month of Ramadan.
In the world's most populous Muslim country, Indonesia, it's a time of year that often sees a rise in both consumption and food prices. 
That's because it's quite common for people to break their fast with big groups, including family or colleagues. 
But this year, there's a new enterprise: mobilising motorcycle taxis for food delivery and it's giving people more options to break their fast.  The BBC's Alice Budisatrijo reports.

Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Australia lists Koalas as endangered species - BBC News,"Australia has listed the koala as an endangered species across most of its east coast, after a dramatic decline in numbers.

The once-thriving marsupial has been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.

Australia has been urged to do more to protect koalas from rapidly diminishing habitats and climate change.

The species was listed as ""vulnerable"" in those states and territory only in 2012. Despite the rapid deterioration, governments have been accused of dithering.

What if All the Earth’s Land Became Ocean,"More than seventy percent of the Earth is covered with water, and that massive amount of it is one of the main reasons life exists on this planet. But if water and land were to swap places, the Earth would become a completely different place. How would it affect the climate? Would humans as a species even exist in a world so radically different from our own?

Let's try to look at some of the more drastic changes that would happen if land was to become water and water was to replace land on mother Earth. For the sake of easy map drawing, let's say that it was a direct one to one flip. Everywhere there's land, there's water, and vice versa. The Atlantic Ocean? The continent of Atlantica. The Great Lakes? The Great Islands.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

Thomas Headon - How Do I Know (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Thomas Headon - How Do I Know (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Thomas Headon likes to show love to the two cities that shaped him. Melbourne is where he grew up, and the 21-year-old glowingly recalls its “insane scene of alternative bands” that influenced his own left-of-center music. Conversely, London is both his birthplace and current home, not to mention, “the music capital of the world,” according to the singer. As much as he might feel like a small fish in its big pond, he’s starting to make his own waves in the grey-skied city. Channeling influences like The 1975, Rex Orange County, and Coldplay, Headon’s “Grace” and “Clean Me Up” introduced him in 2019 as an earnest artist unafraid of using a cute piano melody. When the pandemic hit, ""I found an audience in lockdown,” says the man who took a shot at music because he “wasn’t good at anything else.” Fans flocked on TikTok and, to his surprise, Twitch - spaces where creativity was thriving. With things opening up lately, Headon is taking advantage. Audiences will get to see his special brand of lovesick tunes in person on a US/UK tour that starts in March. Don't worry, he'll play “How Do I Know?” and “Strawberry Kisses,” and if they're as hot as these studio performances, look out.

40 HACKS FOR ANY OCCASSION,"HACKS FOR ANY OCCASSION


Coca-Cola can be used for many cleaning tasks around the home, even removing gum from hair. This is a guide about using Coca-Cola for removing bubble gum in hair.

I have a 5 year old niece who keeps chewing bubble gum and last week it got stuck in her hair. First reaction, I have to cut the gum out of her hair. But my little girl didn't want to cut her hair, because she wanted to be Queen Elsa of Frozen. So here is what I did; simply take a Coca Cola soft drink and pour it on the portion hair with the bubble gum. Let it soak for 2 minutes. This removed the gum easily. Great work again Cola!


Here's how I get nice sharp collars - just the way I like them - without the fuss of ironing. In the morning when I'm getting ready for work, I don't always have time to iron my collars down. Instead, I grab a pair of hair straighteners and get them hot, then press the fold of the collar down for few seconds at a time, ironing the crease sharp.

The hair straightener as clothes iron is a smart little life hack that could definitely save time when you want to iron out a quick wrinkle or sharpen a crease for the event that you don't have time to pull out the ironing board!

Walking Tour of MSF's Ebola Treatment Center in DRC

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

UK safari park welcomes baby southern koala in European first - BBC News,"The first southern koala has been born at Longleat safari park in Wiltshire, England.

The joey was born six months ago and spent life safely inside mum Violet's pouch, until recently when they have started to venture out. It's the first of its kind to be born in Europe.

In addition to milk, joeys eat 'pap' - a liquefied form of the mother's faeces which provides the baby with the microbes it needs to digest eucalyptus leaves.

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 
⭐Qui est MSF?
MSF est une organisation humanitaire médicale internationale créée par des médecins et des journalistes en France en 1971. MSF fournit une aide dans près de 80 pays à des personnes dont la survie est menacée par la violence, la négligence ou la catastrophe, principalement en raison de conflits armés, d'épidémies, de malnutrition, d'exclusion de soins de santé ou catastrophes naturelles. MSF fournit une assistance indépendante et impartiale à ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. MSF a reçu le prix Nobel de la paix en 1999 et le prix King Hussein pour l'action humanitaire en 2004.

Quel est le travail de MSF?
Dans les situations d'urgence et leurs suites, MSF fournit des soins de santé, réhabilite et gère des hôpitaux et des cliniques, effectue des interventions chirurgicales, lutte contre les épidémies, mène des campagnes de vaccination, gère des centres d'alimentation pour les enfants souffrant de malnutrition et propose des soins de santé mentale. Au besoin, MSF construit également des puits et distribue de l'eau potable, et fournit des matériaux d'abri tels que des couvertures et des bâches en plastique.

MSF est-elle une agence des Nations Unies?
Non. MSF est une organisation indépendante qui fonctionne sans aucun programme politique, militaire ou religieux. Les activités de MSF ne sont liées à aucune des agences des Nations Unies. Cependant, MSF peut plaider auprès des Nations Unies sur les problèmes médicaux et humanitaires courants.

Où travaille MSF?
MSF travaille principalement dans les pays où elle a trouvé des services insuffisants pour répondre aux besoins médicaux d'une population. MSF est présent dans plus de 60 pays à travers le monde en Asie, en Afrique, en Europe et en Amérique latine.

Les services MSF sont-ils gratuits?
Oui. Tous les services MSF sont gratuits. MSF rejette l'idée que les pays pauvres méritent des soins médicaux de troisième ordre et s'efforce de fournir des soins de haute qualité aux patients et recherche du personnel hautement professionnel (médical et non médical). Par exemple, dans la mission MSF qui soigne les blessés de guerre irakiens, MSF couvre toutes les dépenses liées au traitement, y compris les frais de voyage, d'hébergement, etc.

D'où vient l'argent de MSF?
La clé de la capacité de MSF à agir de manière indépendante en réponse à une crise est son financement privé et indépendant. En 2015, 92% des revenus de MSF provenaient de sources privées. Plus de 5,7 millions de donateurs individuels et de fondations privées dans le monde ont rendu cela possible.

La présence de MSF est-elle toujours basée sur une base temporaire ou d'urgence?
MSF ne représente pas une alternative pour les formations sanitaires des pays où elle intervient. MSF essaie de combler le vide des besoins médicaux et humanitaires. Lorsque ces besoins sont satisfaits, MSF cède la place aux établissements de santé locaux et apporte son soutien aux autres populations dans le besoin.

"If You Kept a Plastic Bottle in Your Car, Don't Drink from It","Your car seems like a good place to keep some items you don't want to carry around, but even the most seemingly harmless things can lead to trouble. Number one is aerosol cans: hairspray, deodorant, spray paint, household cleaner, and sorts. When you leave sunscreen in your car, it gets exposed to high temperatures, and it can ultimately shorten its shelf life. A plastic water bottle can act as a lens, magnifying the sun's rays and starting a fire. Batteries can lose their capacity to work at full power when they are left abandoned in the car.

What If You Time Traveled but Can't Choose Where or When?,"Watch more videos in our new App: https://bit.ly/3g9KM8j 

Hey guys! Do you like time travel stories? An incredible one happened to me recently. I was sorting boxes in my grandpa's garage and came across an old calculator. I wanted to check if it was still working, so I gave it new batteries, pressed ON… and everything disappeared. It was so dark that I couldn't see anything around me. I had a slight feeling of being pushed somewhere. A moment later, I could see again. I wasn't in the garage anymore but standing in the middle of a narrow street.

Walking around me were people dressed in kilt-like skirts and sandals. I looked around and, far away, I spotted a pyramid. Was it a Pyramid of Giza? Did that mean I was in Egypt? It seemed like the calculator was some sort of teleportation machine. But then another thought struck me: what if there was only one pyramid? There should have been three. This meant that the calculator didn't just teleport me through space, but through time, too. It was a time machine, and I was somewhere around 2550 B.C. when only one of Giza's great pyramids had been built!

Verse 1 
(Frankee)

You said you wanna ride with me  
You wanna feel alive with me,
But you love so casually  
I heard it once, I don't wanna hear it twice.  
You said you could provide for me 
You know you can confide in me, 
You never have to lie to me 
I said it once & I ain't gonna say it twice 

Pre Chorus - 
(Nadine)

I don't know what you want me to be but I want you to be happy 
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality.
I don’t know what you want me to be but i want you to be happy,
I can see but don’t want to believe my own reality.

Chorus -
(All)

So come on preach 
All your misery that ain't what I need 
So come on preach 
That's what you gotta do to keep my company 
So come on Preach 
Say you’re gonna leave then maybe you should go 
Or you can preach 
And hope that I believe it.

I don't feel your touch don't feel your love 
Your love  
I don't feel your touch don't feel your love 
Your love  


Verse 2 -
(Annie)

A beautiful catastrophe 
Drama to a tragedy, 
Happened so casually 
I told you once I ain't gonna tell you twice.
You say you wanna rock for me 
But you don't know geology 
You’re drying up the treasury 
I said it once and I ain't gonna say it twice 


Pre - 
(Nadine)

I don't know what you want me to be but I want you to be happy 
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality.
I don’t know what you want me to be but i want you to be happy,
I can see but don’t want to believe my own reality.


Chorus 
(All) - 

So come on preach 
All your misery that ain't what I need 
So come on preach 
That's what you gotta do to keep my company 
So come on Preach 
Say you’re gonna leave then maybe you should go 
Or you can preach 
And hope that I believe it.

I don't feel your touch don't feel your love

I don't feel your touch don't feel your love 
Your love

Polynomial division introduction | Algebra 2 | Khan Academy,"Keep going! Check out the next lesson and practice what you’re learning:

When we divide the polynomial p(x) by q(x) we are basically asking ""what should we multiply by q(x) to get p(x)?"" If this sounds familiar, it's because it's very similar to dividing numbers! In this introduction we see how some quotients end up as a polynomial, while other times we have a remainder and cannot express the quotient as a polynomial. This is very similar to quotients of integers!

Britney Spears speaks out against 'abusive' conservatorship at hearing - BBC News,"Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the ""abusive"" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years.

Speaking in open court for the first time in the case, she accused her father of controlling her ""100,000%"", adding ""I just want my life back"".

She said she had been denied the right to have more children, and put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes.

Jamie Spears was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008.

The order was granted after the star was put in hospital after concerns over her mental health.

Elley Duhé - COUNTERFEIT (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Elley Duhé - COUNTERFEIT - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

A year ago Elley Duhé was an impressive talent standing in the shadows. But after a wild summer riding her Zedd collabo “Happy Now,” and making a dent on her own with “Way Down Low,” the Alabama native is enjoying the spotlight a bit. Deservedly so. You can hear Duhé’s pop skills from a mile away, so it seems right that she’s hitting a stride as we move toward 2019. Actually, indications of her gifts have been bubbling for a minute or two. Last year’s “immortal” made a big impression on those looking for feisty young alt acts, and when Snakehips dropped their remix, it only reminded how strong the track originally was. “Millennium,” which Duhé made with Tarro, was dreamy and irresistible; Gryffin’s ""Tie Me Down” boasted a plaintive yet powerful vocal that gave the song some extra shimmer. Both revealed the singer’s mix of soul and swag, making the emotions of both performances all the more fierce. So things are def happening for the 26-year-old who was raised on the Gulf Coast get-away of Dauphin Island, where her dad ran a surf shop and music was constantly in the air. The six tracks of her recent 'DRAGON MENTALITY' EP bolster her music's impact, from the heartfelt punch of ""LOST MY MIND"" to the ride-or-die camaraderie of ""WAY DOWN LOW"" to the big boom of ""STARZ."" That’s one way to define artistic reach. Our Vevo Artists To Watch performances of “Savior” and “Counterfeit” are the real deal. Just like Elley herself.

Being Seriously Ill In the U.S.: Financial and Healthcare Impacts,"What is it like to be seriously ill in America today? From heavy financial burdens — despite insurance —  to varied hospital experiences, to impacts on caregivers, people with serious illnesses shared their experiences through a recent poll by the New York Times, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Harvard Chan School. The findings carry significant implications for national debates on basic health insurance requirements and on the reach of programs such as Medicare. In this Forum, a panel of experts unpacked the poll findings, as well as explored practical ways in which health systems can change to help the most ill Americans.

This Harvard event was presented in collaboration with The Commonwealth Fund on December 5, 2018.

Wisp - Your face (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Wisp - Your face | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Wisp moves softly around our DSCVR stage, whispering haunting lyrics about a lovelorn character, reminiscing over past relationships and unrequited love. Shrouded in strands of auburn hair, her mysterious demeanor belies her reputation as one of Gen Z’s most prominent shoegaze acts. Her breakthrough single, “Your face,” sticks to the sound of the genre’s early ‘90s roots – fuzzy guitars, analog synths, and hazed out vocals – but recontextualizes it for the digital age, breathing new life into a scene often characterized by its unchanging sound. 
In her breakthrough EP, ‘Pandora’, Wisp’s music isn’t exactly lo-fi, but it does have an underwater quality that becomes hypnotic as the project moves from song to song. Her moody, sometimes brutal, sound has transcended audiences, as rock and rap fans alike have rallied to support the California native’s rise. There’s even an edge in the way she talks about her past life as a college student majoring in comp-sci, “It was probably the thing that I hated the most at the time.” This My Bloody Valentine fan is a rare gem in our DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025 roster: a mysterious, poetic singer with heater after heater in a genre often thought dead. Having admitted to us that performing in front of crowds is “the best feeling,” Wisp took “I remember how your hands felt on mine” and “Your face” to new heights. Here we could conclude with her plans for an upcoming album, but in the spirit of Wisp, let’s keep things mysterious.

Libianca - People (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024,"Libianca – People | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024

Start with 2019’s “LEVEL” and work your way towards this year’s “Tonight,” and you see how Libianca’s early promise has morphed into her current maturity, the kind that makes its mark with emotional candor, musical vision, and augmented stature. We appreciated Complex positing that the Cameroonian-American singer/songwriter behind last year’s rather incredible “People” “defied the algorithmic odds.” Meaning that the singer who also brought a gentle passion to her cover of Billie Eilish’s “Everything I Wanted” started hot, but instead of flaming out, made a deeper impact with each new move. Impact that has secured her ubiquity. Happily so, because the 22-year-old fan of Keyshia Cole and Shakira has been working on this pop dream for almost a decade. Critical huzzahs, a Viewer’s Choice win in the International Act category at this year’s BET Awards, and an opening slot on Alicia Keys’ recent world tour are the results of childhood choir practice, a decade’s-worth of studies, plenty of teen performances, learning how to engineer her own recordings, and a 2021 stint on ‘The Voice.’ “People” is approaching a half-billion Spotify streams and its vid has surpassed 200 million views in nine months. Like Ayra Starr, Tiwa Savage, and Tems, the Minneapolis native blends R&B, Afrobeats, soul - calling the intersection of all three “my sweet spot.” Its introspective vibe comes from an honest recollection of a down evening when the singer, who lives with the mood disorder Cyclothymia, had imbibed a bit and dipped out of a social gathering to her studio. There she drove around the Web, found a gorgeous instrumental by Mage The Producer, and let her lyrical talends flow. “I closed my eyes and it just came out really,” she said. “I didn’t necessarily write it. It was exactly how I was feeling.” Check her performances of her hit and the new “angeldemon.” All that poetic sincerity is right up front.

WHO ARE KARA AND NATE?!  - We decided to take a year off to travel the world in January 2016. Daily vlogging was not the original plan, but we quickly fell in love with it and now post a video every day! About halfway through the year, we knew we weren’t going to be ready to stop traveling in December, so now we have a new goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019! On our channel you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit ;)

28 GENIUS IDEAS THAT WILL HELP TO SOLVE ANY PROBLEM || DIY HOME REPAIR AND DESIGN,"AMAZING HOME REPAIR TRICKS YOU’LL LOVE

We’re getting crafty today and I’m showing you some brilliant ways to fix everything around you. You don’t need many tools, sometimes you just need things from your kitchen cupboard.
If there’s a hole in your wall, you can fill it with a plastic bag, and then add some silicone on top. Using a palette knife even it out so that it looks flat on the wall. And finally, paint it the same color as your wall. 
To avoid ruining your paint tray, cover it with a plastic bag or some cling film use it, and then discard it. This way it will always be good as new.
You can also fix breaks in your bathroom ceramics using noodles and some glue. Then, let it soak flatten it out and make it smooth, paint on top of it with some spray paint and voila. 
You can also fix some breaks in wooden furniture using rice and glue. Get rid of the excess and buff it out with a sanding block. 
Watch until the end to see how to fix a burn on a wooden floor.

How Does AI Actually Work?,"This week, we have a special episode for you! There has been so much talk about AI over the last year or two, but not a lot of explanations. What is AI?

This talk switches between a general overview of AI and an in-depth discussion about the meaning of intelligence. Danu has years of experience in this field so we hope you learn as much as we did!

From war hero to parliament bomb plot suspect - BBC News,"Former Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko caught the world's attention as a prisoner of Russia. Feted back home as a Ukrainian war hero, she was made an MP.

The story of what has happened to her since - including being accused of plotting to blow up Kiev's parliament -  is as strange as the recent course of Ukrainian politics.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Leonard Susskind is a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University, and founding director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. He is widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory and in general as one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a researcher and an educator.

SUMMARY:
- There are a lot of ways you can do it. Close your eyes, and visualize your dreams. Try to pay attention to every little detail. 
- Start writing your thoughts and ideas into a diary. It’d be really awesome if you try to do it the old-fashioned way. Ya know, with a pen and paper. 
- Read all kinds of books, watch movies and documentaries, get out and see the world or even your home town.
- You also have to be ready to change some details of your plans or to compromise if it’s really necessary.
- Try to think about it like, “What job would I choose if I didn’t need a job at all?” It must be something that helps you accomplish your goals and unlock your potential. 
- Find your own, even better way of doing things! Creating new approaches will give you a new perspective on old problems and help you find more effective solutions. 
- You must always remember why you’re working toward something. Here’s a hint: you’re doing it for yourself! Don’t wait until other people start noticing you or showering you with praise.
- If you’re constantly being criticized for an idea, then don’t take it personally but also don’t ignore it entirely! If it’s constructive criticism (that is, it has some kind of logical backing), then think of it as free advice! 
- Don’t even bother trying to avoid mistakes. They’re inevitable because you’re human. Think of it as a necessary part of the learning process. Turn your failure into wisdom. 
-  “Will I succeed or not? Am I the right person for this? Maybe I should just give up?” That’s why you have to just turn off your brain, and silence these thoughts. All they do is put you under a bunch of pressure and stress you out.

#Victory #GloryHour #IDontHaveToPretend

Hold me in the air
I know
That you heal me
My eyes crying tears
My heart
In humility
Please
My gaze upon my complaints
Here at the altar
Why should I carry this weight
Why should I suffer
When I have a savior who intimately cares
For my sake
Yes I have a savior
Who came to bare this grief in my place
I don't have to pretend like everythings ok
That's not what Jesus meant
When he said to have faith
If you see me crying
I’m being true
Instead of lying about what I am going through
I’m trusting God to heal my every wound
And I know he will
He makes all things new
All things new
Breathe life in death
I need you to resurrect
This heart from the dead
One touch from you is all I request
Plead my case upon my complaints
Here at the altar
Why should I carry this weight
Why should I suffer
When I have a savior
Who intimately cares
For my sake
Yes I have a savior who came to bear this grief
In my place
I don't have to pretend
Like everythings ok
That's not what jesus meant when he said to
have faith
If you see me crying
I’m being true
Instead of lying about what I am going through
I’m trusting God to heal my every wound
And I know he will
He makes all things
new
I don't have to
‘Cause he makes all things new
All things new
All things new
I don't have to
‘Cause he makes all things new
All things new
All things new
I don't have to
‘Cause he makes all things new
New
I don’t have to
‘Cause he makes all things new

"Apollo 11 yesterday, Next Giant Leap tomorrow on This Week @NASA","NASA is celebrating the 45th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, with crewmate Michael Collins manning the command service module from lunar orbit, became the first humans on the moon -- with Armstrong's historic first step onto the lunar surface becoming a symbolic giant leap for humanity. Today, with Apollo 11 as inspiration, NASA is taking the steps needed for America's next giant leap, to send astronauts to Mars. The path to Mars will use a stepping stone approach consisting of key elements, including human health and technology research aboard the International Space Station; development and evolution of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion deep space capsule and development of other game-changing technologies to enable tomorrow's missions.

Lyrics:
I'm a heavyweight
I'm a left turn
I'm the top floor
Of a bad burn

Tell you my lips
Don't meet
Heavy breath
Sharp teeth

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Take a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone  
In a cab on a weeknight
I'm coming undone I'm coming undone I'm coming un…

I don't wanna hurt nobody

I'm broke
So strange
Coz you bathe
In loose change

When my face
Hits yours
The crowd
Applauds

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Take a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone  
In a cab on a weeknight
I'm coming undone I'm coming undone I'm coming un…

I don't wanna hurt nobody

I woke heart thumping
Coz I wanted to be something
When I followed reason then it turned out to be nothing x 2

At the park in the streetlight
Coming undone
Take a hit in a fistfight
Coming undone  
In a cab on a weeknight
I'm coming undone I'm coming undone I'm coming un…

I don't wanna hurt nobody

Here it is
The end
Goodbye
My friend

14 Mental Traps That Keep Controlling Your Life,"How to stop people from taking advantage of you? How to finally become a confident person? Sometimes we fall into our own mind’s trap, and we make decisions that can go completely wrong. 

It’s easy to fall victim to different clichés and stereotypes pounded into our head by society. Our minds constantly play games with us, setting traps and imaginary obstacles. 

TIMESTAMPS
Double standards 0:36
Arguing just for the sake of winning 1:23
Comparing apples to oranges 2:16
Trusting only “your” people 3:00
Overgeneralization 3:51
Blindly jumping on the bandwagon 4:42
We remember only our best traits and actions 5:28
Our brain thinks we’re someone else in the future 6:17
The Peltzman Effect 7:19
Positive expectations 7:59
Catchy jingles and rhymes 8:50
There's always more bad news 9:31
The IKEA Effect 10:12
The “superiority over others” trap 10:52

SUMMARY
- We hold different standards for different people. We often excuse some people’s behavior but not others’ by arguing they that they have certain life troubles and issues. 
- Scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber proposed a theory that people have learned how to argue just for the opportunity to influence each other. 
- We often compare things that are totally incomparable, which causes us to make incorrect decisions and conclusions at the end. 
- Since ancient times, we wittingly or unwittingly divide people into groups: “us” versus “them”. And we trust the people in “our” group more: family, friends, colleagues and loved ones. 
- If something unpleasant has ever happened to you in the past, it seems to leave a bad taste in your mouth forever. 
- Human beings are social creatures by nature, and just like other animals that live in groups, we interact and depend on each other. That's why people are inclined to do or believe something if they know that the majority does or believes this too. 
- For better or worse, people are people, and we’re all a bit egoistic. We like to acknowledge only our best features. 
- Different studies show that when we start imagining ourselves in the future, it activates the parts of our brain that work when we think about different people. 
- The gist of this phenomenon is that an abundance of different protective devices and safety equipment lead a person to think they’re invincible, so the risk of an accident increases. 
- Having positive expectations is a trap common among addicted gamblers: they’re sure that after a series of losses, their good luck will appear, and the next game will definitely bring a jackpot! 
- When people hear catchy jingles or see rhyming slogans, they subconsciously treat them as more trustworthy. 
- It's no secret, people are pessimists at heart! But scientists propose another theory. They say that we subconsciously treat bad news as more important. When something good happens, it gives us less food for thought, yet bad news leaves a lot of room for contemplation. 
- IKEA effect: seemingly ordinary gloves knitted by your dear little Granny bring a smile to your face, but you wouldn’t even notice a similar pair at the store. 
- In most cases, people have a high opinion of their own skills. They overestimate their abilities, which is why they can’t rate themselves objectively.

"Best Portuguese Food - GIANT TIGER PRAWNS and Seafood at Cervejaria Ramiro in Lisbon, Portugal!","►Check out my Lisbon Travel Guide [PDF eBook]: https://goo.gl/L7cF7X
►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Camera I use: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hv

On Day 25 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance we were in Lisbon, Portugal. Along with visiting some famous attractions in Lisbon, nothing compared to having one of the best seafood meals of my life at the legendary Cervejaria Ramiro.

1:48 Elevador de Santa Justa - Located just a short walk from Praça de D. Pedro IV (Rossio Square), the Elevador de Santa Justa or the Santa Justa lift is a historical elevator that you can ride to the top for a great view of Lisbon. Since I was in the area and it wasn’t busy I decided to go for it. Price - 5 EUR

4:31 Castelo de São Jorge - From Praça da Figueira we took the bus up the hill to Castelo de São Jorge, which is one of the top things to do in Lisbon. After paying the entrance fee, we walked around the castle, which is situated on the top of one of Lisbon’s hills as a citadel. The views of the surrounding area and the castle itself were spectacular. This is a must visit attraction in Lisbon. Price - 8.50 EUR per person

8:01 Epic seafood at Cervejaria Ramiro - If you ask anyone where to eat the best Portuguese seafood meal in Lisbon, undoubtedly the number one response you’ll hear is Cervejaria Ramiro. It’s a seafood palace of a restaurant that’s popular with both locals and tourists alike, everyone comes for the abundance of incredibly fresh seafood. It actually almost feels like a Chinese restaurant when you’re eating at Cervejaria Ramiro from the liveliness and the fresh seafood tanks. We started off with some prawns in garlic sauce and then ate clams in garlic and then had crab. The crab roe was intensely amazing, and I’ve never seen a crab with so much roe in my life. Next we had some of the greatest shrimp / prawns I’ve ever seen. I ordered 2 tiger prawns which were the size of lobsters, and then 2 scarlet prawns, a type I had never eaten before. Both were incredibly delicious, some of the best prawns and seafood I’ve ever tried. Finally, my last seafood dish at Cervejaria Ramiro was a plate of goose barnacles and some oysters. For steak at Cervejaria Ramiro one of the popular things you have to eat is called a prego, which is steak sandwich. After eating all that seafood, somehow the steak sandwich hits the spot. Our total price - 108 EUR for everything we ate and ordered.

26:23 Lisbon Cathedral - The Lisbon Cathedral is one of the first cathedrals and earliest buildings in Lisbon, and it’s a fantastic sight to see. 

27:31 Rua Augusta Arch - After walking around the Lisbon Cathedral we then headed to the main plaza of Lisbon and walked around the Rua Augusta Arch and got a nice view of the Tagus river.

29:10 Piri piri chicken at Frangasqueira Nacional - Finally to end this amazing day of Portuguese food and attractions in Lisbon, we headed to Frangasqueira Nacional to try their piri piri chicken. It’s just a small takeaway restaurant, but the passion of the owners is evident. The piri piri chicken was awesome. Total price - 14 EUR

This was probably my favorite day of our trip to Lisbon, with a perfect mix of incredible Portuguese food, especially seafood at Cervejaria Ramiro and visiting attractions in Lisbon.

Disclaimer and Thank You: 
Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-the-world) for sponsoring my business class flights.

"Aung San Suu Kyi being treated well, Myanmar army insists - BBC News","Myanmar's military has told the BBC that authorities are not mistreating ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

The 76-year-old former leader has not been seen in public since a February military coup removed her from office.

The BBC's interview with military spokesman Major General Zaw Min Tun comes after the release of US journalist Danny Fenster who had been sentenced to 11 years in prison.

Dozens of journalists and thousands of people have been held since the coup.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

"8 Popular Foods We Don't Eat Anymore, Here's Why","What foods do you buy daily? How about SunnyD? Or maybe congealed salad is the thing you can't live without? Yup, these foods are so unpopular now! However, just 20–40 years ago they were flying off the grocery store shelves!

SUMMARY:
- TV dinners first stepped onto the scene in the 1950s when Swanson was looking for a way to sell their Thanksgiving food leftovers. They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.
- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma’s house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.
- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast — and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. 
- One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day — and these were intended for kids! 
- Back in the late ’80s and ‘90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn’t as desirable anymore.
- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. 
- Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‘90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.
- It wasn’t until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It’s very mild in flavor and isn’t super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‘50s into the ‘70s.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

SURABAYA, INDONESIA - Today we’re going to eat some of the best food in Surabaya from the island of Madura! 

Huge thank you to Budi Tarjo: https://www.instagram.com/IndonesiaDiscoverer/ (He offers incredible tours in Indonesia), for taking me around Surabaya! 

Madura is an island located right across a small channel of water from the main Java island of Indonesia and from Surabaya. So within the major city of Surabaya you’ll find many people from Madura and a huge selection of Madura food. Food in Madura is famous around Indonesia - for example one of the most common versions of satay (sate) is Madura Sate. Today we’re going to eat five unique Madura foods, that you don’t want to miss.

Soto Madura Imam Bonjol (https://maps.app.goo.gl/7xWi7YgrAGxCMWKb6) - Soto Madura is a beef soup, commonly eaten for breakfast, and it’s one of the best soups I’ve had. So good and so flavorful. 

Warung Kongde Mbak May (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ss6T6zWADj1Sbby18) - Welcome to probably the funniest food stall in all of Surabaya, maybe in all of Indonesia!? Warung Kongde Mbak May serves Madura style rice and mixed dishes and the flavors are spicy and intensely flavorful. 

Bubur Madura - Typically you think of rice porridge as savory, but this rare Madura style of rice porridge is sweet, with a variety of jellys and palm sugars. It’s quite a complex and delicious dessert. 

Sate Ayam Madura Pak Mat (https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ACpuUikkH3k4VCF6) - You can’t go on a Madura street food tour without eating Madura sate (satay), a type of sate preparation that’s commonly found all over Indonesia. 

Nasi Bebek Pak Sayeki (https://maps.app.goo.gl/EnnK4amRYQafo3P38) - Next up we’re on our way to a Indonesia food truck that specializes in another Madura delicacy; Bebek Hitam - Fried duck with fried blackened spices.

Surabaya is a food haven, and they are well represented by Madura Indonesian food!

Taliban appeals for international support after Afghanistan earthquake – BBC News,"The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid after the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades.

The earthquake struck early on Wednesday about 44km (27 miles) from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India.

The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in the worst-hit Paktika province.

Afghanistan's health system was facing near collapse even before the disaster.

"Boris Johnson accused of ""treating public with contempt"" after backing Dominic Cummings - BBC News","Boris Johnson has publicly backed his most senior and influential adviser, Dominic Cummings, in the face of calls for him to be sacked for breaching the coronavirus lockdown rules.   

The Prime Minister said Mr Cummings had followed “the instincts of every father” and had acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity”. 

His adviser drove more than 250 miles from his London home to his parents' house in County Durham, along with his wife who had symptoms of coronavirus.  There are also claims that the couple left the Durham address to visit local beauty spots. 

The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Boris Johnson should have sacked his aide and was “treating the British public with contempt”.  Some Conservative MPs have also called for Mr Cummings to resign or be sacked.

Using Grindr to connect LGBTQI+ people with health care,"As part of MSF’s work to get more people from the LGBTQI+ community in northern Honduras to come in for health care, our health promotion teams started reaching out to users through ads on Grindr this year. This is the first time MSF has used the dating app, which is used by members of the LGBTQI+ community, in order to engage people who might not otherwise come to a clinic to get care—and the initiative was a big success. It was one part of a campaign that also included face-to-face activities, health fairs, and outreach to other organizations.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Smallness of Molecules,"How small is a molecule? In this StarTalk explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are here to help you visualize a molecule’s actual size. 

To start, Neil gives his favorite thought experiment to help us understand the size of molecules. You’ll learn why this leads Chuck to say he’s never drinking water again. Discover more about “quantum construction” and building things on a molecular level. You’ll learn about Avogadro's number and measuring things in mole.

We explore why it’s remarkable that we were even able to discover molecules at all. Neil explains how our five senses held us back from discovering things until we invented ways outside our senses to discover them. All that, plus, we discuss why there’s a philosophical issue in our own physiology when it comes to communicating things of extraordinary size in the universe.

Brexit: MPs block Prime Minister’s bid for early election – BBC News,"The UK Prime Minister's demand for an early General Election looks set to be rejected by Members of Parliament after opposition parties agreed it shouldn't take place until after the European Union Summit in mid-October. 

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru the party of Wales say they won't back the government's bid for an election. They declared they wanted an extension to the Brexit date of October 31st to guarantee that the UK won't leave the EU without a deal. 

On a visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson accused them of making an ""extraordinary political mistake"". It came as the House of Lords approved a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It will get royal assent and become law on Monday.

Syria: Turkish military operation against Kurds – BBC News,"The long-planned Turkish military operation in north-east Syria has been launched. Kurdish forces, which control the area, reported heavy airstrikes and widespread panic. 
Turkey’s decision was prompted by President Trump’s announcement that US troops would withdraw from the region where thousands of captured Islamic State fighters are being held by Kurdish forces. 
President Erdogan of Turkey says his aim is to create a so-called 'safe zone', cleared of Kurdish fighters. 
The Kurds were key allies of America in defeating the Islamic State group and they say they've been betrayed by President Trump. 
The BBC’s Middle East Correspondent Orla Guerin reports from the Turkish-Syrian border; Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen analyses the implications for the region; Jon Sopel reports from the White House.
