Chxrry22 - Wasteland (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Chxrry22 - Wasteland (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Inking a major label contract is cool, but when it's with the one formed by your hometown hero? That’s the cherry on top. Terrible puns and geographic heritage aside, the new marriage between The Weeknd’s XO imprint and Toronto native Chxrry22 is looking like a perfect match. The sultry singer’s brand of alternative R&B is exquisitely moody, sinfully dreamy, and keen to divulge all the dirty details. Hmm, sounds familiar. Remember the dusky percussion that consumed Abel's early ‘Trilogy’ projects? You’ll find them stalking listeners of Chxrry’s 2022 EP ‘The Other Side.’ “I’m inspired by my city, my culture, and other powerful women,” she told us while citing her sound as a blend between Lana Del Rey and Rihanna. Earlier this year, the starlet-to-be performed songs from the EP at a sold out Toronto show - yet another feather in her cap. It also meant she was totally locked in for our DSCVR sesh. Dim the lights down low and dive into these luxurious takes of “Wasteland” and “The Other Side.”

"Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Difference Between Mass, Weight, and Density","If you’re trying to get in shape you need to lose weight, right? Neil deGrasse Tyson says wrong. On this StarTalk explainer, Neil and comic co-host Chuck Nice are breaking down the differences between mass, weight, and density. 

To start, Neil tells us why when you want to get in shape, you need to lose mass. You’ll learn why a weight-loss book written by a physicist would just be one sentence. We explore the difference between mass and weight and why weight is all about forces. 

Then, we move on to density. Find out why heavy cream is lighter than skim milk. We explore how the hull of a ship keeps the ship buoyant. All that, plus, Neil explains why, if you want to lose weight quickly, just head to the Moon and hop on a scale.

About the prints that flank Neil in this video:

The disabled Ukrainians facing a lifetime of mistreatment and abuse – BBC News,"Warning: Viewers may find some images in this report distressing.

BBC News has gained access to institutions in Ukraine where widespread abuse and mistreatment of disabled people has been uncovered.

Around 100,000 children and young people live in these institutions, which pre-date the war with Russia.

Human rights investigators say Ukraine should not join the European Union until it closes these institutions.

The Ukrainian government has promised a series of reforms over the past few years, acknowledging that its system of institutionalisation needs to change.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Scientist Found a Plant That Could Change the World,"In the Mexican mountains, there's an ancient corn with huge cobs and crazy aerial roots that drip slime, which could revolutionize agriculture by reducing the need for toxic chemicals. Locals have been growing this unique corn for over 2,000 years. Another amazing plant is bamboo, which is a food staple in countries like China, Japan, and the Philippines, and even used in traditional dishes in Bangladesh. Then there's the Cinchona tree, whose bark is used to make quinine, a cure for malaria. The Quechua people of Peru were the ones who taught newcomers how to use Cinchona bark effectively.

Did you know, for example, that warming Choco Pies in a microwave makes it twice as big and three times as tasty?

Today, Bright Side offers you a selection of tips on how to say goodbye to many of your tricky chores!

TIMESTAMPS:
Using a mixer 0:24
Eating Choco Pies 0:42
Preserving vegetables 1:03
Opening a coconut 1:22
Cleaning mushrooms 1:51
Storing bananas 2:12
Preparing dry breakfasts 2:36

Opening a bag of chips 4:45
Opening pesky pistachios 5:06
Making chocolate chips 5:31
Drinking coke 5:52
Eating ice cream 6:12
Using toothpaste 6:37

SUMMARY:
- To use a mixer like a pro, put a paper plate on its beaters. It will serve as a temporary cover that’ll eliminate unwanted spray.
- If you want to double longevity of salad leaves and keep them fresh, rinse them and then store them sandwiched in a container between paper napkins. 
- This is easy to remember: never wash mushrooms under running water! It’s best to clean them using a wet towel and brush as this helps preserve its aroma.
- Cornflakes and other types of cereal quickly cease to be crispy if you leave the box open even for a few minutes. You can solve this problem by placing them in a hot oven for 5-10 minutes.
- Want to clean dirty pots and pans easily? Simply place them in boiling water and add a small amount of vinegar. This hack saves time and effort!
- To make a real cheeseburger, wait until the meat is ready, place a slice of cheese on top, add a little water, and cover the frying pan with a lid. The cheese will melt within 3-5 seconds.
- You can easily rescue your overdone cookies by removing the burned bits with a grater. No one will even suspect that something went wrong!
- A study shows that the top of all beverage cans is full of germs and bacteria. You will do your health a favor drinking coke from a can with a straw. Thus you’ll avoid contamination.
- Instead of scooping ice cream from a pack, you can cut it into portions right with the package and even make ice cream sandwiches!
- Studies show that toothpaste isn’t healthy for our teeth if we abuse it. Do you think that the more toothpaste you squeeze the better? You’re wrong!

spill tab - calvaire (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"spill tab - calvaire. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Claire Chicha has been exposed to various world cultures in a way unique to most her age. Perhaps that explains the diverse musical repertoire of spill tab, her indie project that’s been active in various iterations since 2018. Dive into spill tab’s music and you'll find everything from alt-pop to house to singer-songwriter ballads. Raised by French and Korean parents, Chicha lived in Bangkok, Thailand for a year as a young teen, where she discovered EDM via the city’s vibrant party scene. Then she moved to Paris, where getting a grip on the language allowed her to form a sort of French-singing alter ego. “Santé"" and “calvaire” are a pair of pithy electro hor d’oeuvres sung in French. Aside from her breathy vocals, they sound a bit different - a little sultrier in feel and more EDM-adjacent - from the other two tracks on the lactose-intolerant singer’s 'Oatmilk' EP. And check “PISTOLWHIP,” her latest release, where her vocals are pitch-manipulated over badass bursts of distortion. She performed that song and “calvaire” here at DSCVR HQ, covering the entire spill tab spectrum while providing a perfect intro to a talent who gets a kick out of mixing all the colors of her sonic palette.

Tye Tribbett - New (Live Performance) | Vevo,"Tye Tribbett - New (Live Performance) 

Bam! From the moment Tye Tribbett opens his mouth on ""New,"" a gloriously fresh approach to gospel is being delivered. If a commitment to a more spiritual life rests upon renouncing previous paths and dedicating time to a different perspective, then Tribbett, who has been turning heads with his innovative R&B approach for almost two decades, has summarized it well with his powerhouse anthem. It's no surprise that he's got the skills to explain his point of view. The Grammy-winning artist and his wife Shante are the pasters of an Orlando church that spreads its charismatic Christian message 24/7/365. Jump into their performances of ""New"" and ""We Need You,"" and you'll see just how fervent their approach to spreading the holy word truly is.

1933 Ford Pickup vs. 1979 Dodge Express - Generation Gap: Trucks,"Cast your vote here: http://www.hagerty.com/Articles-Videos/Articles/2014/07/14/Generation-Gap-Trucks

Matt and Davin have very different ideas as to what makes a good pickup. For this episode, Matt chose a 1979 Dodge Lil' Red Express - big Mopar V-8, extreme styling and very limited production. Davin, on the other hand, went with a 1933 Ford Pickup. Boasting the iconic Flathead V-8, this vehicle was born out of necessity and eventually evolved into Ford's incredibly popular F-Series pickups.

Generation Gap appears every other Tuesday on the Motor Trend youtube channel. http://www.youtube.com/motortrend

35 FUNNY RELATIONSHIP FACTS EVERY COUPLE CAN RELATE TO,"TRUTH ABOUT BEING IN RELATIONSHIP

Being in a relationship is not an easy job but also it’s a great source of happiness. Relationships has more benefits like confidance, you have shared interests and love to spend time together, you have a person with whom you can share your secrets and who is ready to help you. Besides, relationships may cause funny and awkward moments because living together have a lot of surprises. You may think that all the humans have only slight differences but when you start living together you understand that boys and girls are from different planets. Check out a very funny compilation of differences between girls and boys. To tell the truth, there are huge differences like morning routine, the number of clothes, attitude to life, how we react to different situations. How many clothes usually boys have? Guys usually have two pairs of pants and several t-shirts. And what about girls? Girls usually spend at least an hour for beauty routine in the morning and boys only clean their teeth.

 Relationships tend to differ through time and we prepared a video with hilarious scenes that describe the difference between the first year of living together and forty years after. First-year is full of drama and! Scandals and jealousy! After years and years of hard work, everything changes. In the beginning of relationships you spend a lot of time going out. Few years later you will prefer to spend time at home watching your favorite show. Remember that even after years of marriage, you can be perfectly happy with your partner and still be attracted to others.

"Hillsborough: The Thirty-year Search for Justice - BBC News","On a spring afternoon in 1989, a crush developed at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield resulting in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans attending the club's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.


After a long and emotional legal journey, Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield was found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans.

Due to the law at the time, there can be no prosecution over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland.

The BBC’s North of England Correspondent Judith Moritz speaks to the families, friends and survivors of the Hillsborough tragedy and reflects on their 30 years of heartbreak.

Pregnant and in danger in Haiti,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) doctor Lisa Searle describes the obstacles to receiving sexual and reproductive health care in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Every month, MSF reaches hundreds of people in need of this care through its mobile clinics, but the city’s health sector is at a breaking point, and more support is needed. 

TRANSCRIPT:
Haiti is in crisis at the moment, particularly since the assassination of the president in July 2021. 

That has forced the country into a downward spiral of violence. So, for Haitians living particularly in the capital city, Port-au-Prince, to access health care services is incredibly challenging. 

We're talking about a situation where the city is segregated into different areas that are under the control of different armed groups.

We hear stories that people have left their neighborhood to seek health care in a different neighborhood, but when they try to come back into their neighborhood, they can be terrorized. 

They're even being shot. 

For a pregnant woman to access care throughout her pregnancy and to deliver in a health facility is almost impossible because of the access issues I mentioned.

Also because there is no free health care. 

We think around 60 to 80 percent of deliveries are happening at home without a skilled birth attendant present, which is an alarming figure. 

We are seeing huge numbers of cases of sexual and gender-based violence, and if care is available, then there are many things that we can prevent.
We can prevent HIV infection, we can prevent unwanted pregnancies, we can prevent infections. 

But so many of these survivors never make it to care.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Fridayy - When It Comes To You (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2024,"Fridayy – When It Comes To You | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024

Earlier this year the Vevo team hosted Fridayy at the Brooklyn location of our ctrl series. To get there requires a quick drive up interstate 95 from the Philly dude’s home city, and we could tell he was really comfortable on the mic that day. Not just comfortable. Totally in his bag. This was right around the release of his self-titled debut, which is less of a conventional R&B tape and something more like a 40 minute seminar in spirituality, resilience, and community. Almost at 2 million views as of now, those ctrl takes of “Stand By Me” and “Done For Me” are an undeniable metric of the crooner’s gravity and growing cache in pop and R&B. DJ Khaled obviously saw the potential when he tapped the son of Haitian immigrants for the title track on ‘GOD DID.’ And check the way he brings a little gospel to Lil Baby’s “Forever.” That one got him a spot on SNL and another chance to woo audiences with his live skills. Fridayy - born Francis LeBlanc - is also a multi-instrumentalist. So it wasn’t a surprised that when we invited him to come to our studios, this time for Artists To Watch 2024, he had drums, bass, and guitar in tow. Backup singers too. “Lost My Way” tiptoes through a dembow riddim. “When It Comes To You” is an R&B love song that leaves ego at the door (spend some time with its nuptial video). We truly can’t wait to see where he goes from here.

US approves first new Alzheimer's drug in 20 years - BBC News,"The first new treatment for Alzheimer's disease for nearly 20 years has been approved by regulators in the United States, paving the way for its use in the UK.

Aducanumab targets the underlying cause of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, rather than its symptoms.

Charities have welcomed the news of a new therapy for the condition.

But scientists are divided over its potential impact because of uncertainty over the trial results.

"The mental health of doctors in Gaza: ""Survival is not a choice""","""Doctors and medical staff in general are trained to see blood, to see things that would be hard to see for most people,” says Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) psychologist Audrey McMahon. ""But what they've been seeing [in Gaza] is extremely distressing and disturbing for any human being.”  

After more than six months of relentless war, Gaza’s healthcare workers have faced unprecedented challenges in providing medical care every day while trying to survive and manage the toll the conflict has taken on them personally. The impact of working in such conditions could leave scars that last for years to come.  

""We've been hearing [how] medical staff in Gaza are heroes,” McMahon says, ""and I think they surely are for what they are doing. And yet it's not a choice. They are all in survival. What else can they do? They have absolutely no time to process what is happening to them. Survival is not a choice.”

"Can You Eat Green Potatoes? Yes, But With a Caveat","If some of those potatoes you left in your pantry turn green, will they still be safe to eat? When these vegetables come in contact with direct sunlight, they turn green because of a little thing called chlorophyll. To prevent potatoes from turning green, you'll need to store them in a dark and well-ventilated area. There are some other food secrets that will help you always eat safely and stay healthy. The way you organize your food in the fridge also matters, so let's learn more about that.

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Dozens killed and hundreds injured in Bangladesh depot explosion – BBC News,"A fire and a huge explosion have killed at least 49 people and injured hundreds more at a storage depot near the city of Chittagong, Bangladesh.

Hundreds of people had arrived to tackle the fire when a number of shipping containers exploded at the site in Sitakunda.

It is thought that chemicals were stored in some of the containers.

Industrial fires are common in Bangladesh, and are often blamed on poor safety regulations.

Many of the injured are said to be in a critical condition and the number of people killed is expected to rise.

OSAKA, JAPAN - Welcome to Osaka, one of the food capitals of Japan and known for their amazing Japanese street food. Today I’ll be taking you to eat at 5 places that serve legendary Japanese street food! 

Nonkiya (のんきや https://maps.app.goo.gl/CaZtvFyirdokWYBJ7) - We’re beginning this tour today with a standing bar that specializes in both oden as well as skewers of tendon simmered in miso sauce. It was delicious and a great heritage restaurant. Price - 1,420 JPY ($8.83)

Matsuya (立ち食いうどんそば 松屋 https://maps.app.goo.gl/TRW3RrB5Xe8eYEbZ7) - Right next to Nonkiya, you’ll find Matsuya, a standing noodle bar that serves signature Osaka style udon noodles with sweet bean curd. There’s no seating, so you jump in, order, and stand to eat. This is real deal Japanese fast food. Price - 250 JPY ($1.55) per bowl

Tengu (てんぐ https://maps.app.goo.gl/hABpfCBmBck7VkpLA ) - One of the quintessential Japanese foods of Osaka is called kushikatsu, an assortment of ingredients on skewered, breaded and deep fried. With some beer, things couldn’t be better. Price - 8,420 JPY ($52.35) for 5 people

Hanadako (はなだこ https://maps.app.goo.gl/3czHzjZBe3G7rtNb6) - When it comes to Osaka street food, nothing is more famous or more popular than takoyaki, octopus batter balls. And ask locals where to eat the best takoyaki in Osaka, and many will point you to Hanadako. Price - 860 JPY ($5.35) for my plate

Izakaya Toyo (居酒屋とよ https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdmsmYdk57amq8B39) - Finally, there was no where else I was more excited to visit on this Japanese food tour in Osaka than Izakaya Toyo, where Mr. Toyo is legendary for his blow torched tuna cheek that he cooks with his bare hands! Price - 8,500 JPY ($52.85) for everything 

When you’re in Osaka, you have a lot of delicious food to try, but don’t miss these 5 classic foods!

Brandon Lay - Miss & Tell (Live) | Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019,"Brandon Lay - Miss & Tell - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2019, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music.

Brandon Lay’s first hit, “Speakers, Bleachers and Preachers,” did a great job of summarizing his West Tennessee upbringing. The catchy portrait cleverly distills the country newcomer’s influences: an ear for music since childhood, a big dose of camaraderie playing high school sports, and life’s values learned from his dad, a Southern Baptist pastor. The 31-year-old’s song has made an impact because it teems with poetic particulars, like the girl who has a “broke-heart necklace and post-game smile.” It’s clocked almost 45M Spotify streams while reminding listeners how emotionally formative school days are. From childhood afternoons where his mom would play Elvis non-stop to hours spent watching country videos on CMT, Lay’s love of music has been in place from the start. He began trying his hand at Georgia Satellites songs at open-mic nights on the outskirts of his hometown of Jackson. Before long he left college and headed to Nashville where he continued to pursue songwriting and performing. Recognition from Music City’s pros bolstered his efforts, and he earned himself opening slots for everyone from Dierks Bentley to Brantley Gilbert. Now with tracks such as “Yada Yada Yada” and “Break Down On Me” behind him, we’re thinking Lay has plenty of miles to go. He’s gotten great response touring with Kenny Chesney and Old Dominion, and his performance chops continue to grow. He crushed his Vevo Artists To Watch session, where “Miss and Tell” and “For My Money” really come to life.

I ran with hyenas 
They told me to beat it

9 Months in the Bronx - BBC News,"Felicia is 22, she's from the Bronx and she's pregnant. She knows that as soon as she gives birth, Children’s Services may come to the hospital and take her baby away. And she’s determined to stop that happening. The film follows Felicia’s 9 months and through the lens of this one pregnancy, it touches on a number of wider issues, from reproductive rights, government intervention including drug testing of mothers at hospital, and the claims of critics that there are disparities in how the welfare system treats low-income and minority mothers.

"Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, assassinated near Tehran - BBC News","Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed.

Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county.

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"".

Western intelligence agencies view Fakhrizadeh as being behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme.

""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014.

News of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that Iran is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons.

Mom in #Gaza shares her challenges in managing health of her young daughter,"Rasha is Ibtissam’s mom. Inside Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, she shares that her little girl has Tay-Sachs disease, a rare genetic condition. “She has special treatments, she also has special food, and special milk.” 

In the pediatric ward, our teams face an overwhelming number of patients. Dr. Mohammad Abu Tayyem, an MSF pediatrician working at Nasser, explains that the war has taken its toll on children who are still growing. “We are treating infants who have infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, and skin diseases.” Families are living in crowded tents or under plastic sheeting and mixed fabrics, without clean water, sanitation services, hygiene items including soap, and other basic needs. MSF teams are providing critical care, but the overwhelming need for resources and support are urgent.

What If the World's Most Massive Dams Break,"A wall of water falling on land and flowing forwards in a quick and powerful mass of streams, eroding the ground and demolishing all structures it meets on its way, leaving nothing behind. It could’ve been a depiction of a tsunami, but it’s a human-made cataclysm: a dam failure. The earliest known disaster of this kind happened almost 1,500 years ago in the Arabian Peninsula, in the ancient kingdom of Saba. Today, a new dam stands in place of the historical one, built in 1980 and functioning well.

A dam can be natural too, though, and when such a thing bursts, nothing good comes of it either. In Sweden, there once was a meltwater lake formed because of glacial debris blocking the course of a river. In 1794, locals received permission to dig a bypass canal to change the course of the river and safely transport logs through it. The work was finished despite many troubles, and the water began to flow... So what happens when dams fail? And what are the biggest dam failures of all time?

Vienna shooting: Austria hunts suspects after 'Islamist terror' attack - BBC News,"Austrian police are searching for at least one suspect after a multiple gun attack in the capital, Vienna, that killed four people.

Seventeen other people have been wounded - some seriously - after gunmen opened fire at six different locations in the city centre on Monday evening.

One attacker was shot dead by police, officials said.

Interior Minister Karl Nehammer described the assailant killed by police as an ""Islamist terrorist"".

Two of those who died in the random shooting were women and two were men. One of the women was reportedly a waitress. The second woman died of her wounds in hospital overnight, reports said.

The victims were in a city centre area busy with people in bars and restaurants, near Vienna's central synagogue, but it is not yet clear if that was the target.

15 Facts About Earth Sound Too Bizarre to Be True,"When it comes to our planet, we consider everything about it to be well-known and usual. Surprisingly, we know much more about space than we do about our common planet. For example, we call Earth the blue planet, though scientists believe that it was not always blue. Inside it’s solid gold, but its surface is covered in viruses. 

Throughout history, humanity hasn’t been able to learn everything about our planet. But the facts that we keep learning are so amazing that they motivate us to keep studying the world we live in. Did you know that our planet is gradually rotating slower and slower? And how birds can create clouds? Or that Earth's toughest living thing is so small you can't see it? Interested?

Street Food in Luang Prabang - WILD GRILLED BEE HONEY COMB! | Morning Market Lao Food Tour!,"►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Luang Prabang is an amazing historical city in Laos, and it also happens to be an amazing city for food. You’ll find an array of incredible Lao food to experience.

Morning Market - One of the best places to get started eating Lao street food in Luang Prabang is the morning market. It’s low-key, relaxing, the vendors are incredibly friendly, and there’s so much delicious food to try. From wild grilled beehive to khao piak sen noodles, the food is so good, it’s hard to ever go anywhere else when you’re in Luang Prabang. The food highlight for me was the grilled honey comb, since it was so rare and unique. Additionally, you’ll have a blast checking out all the ingredient at the market. Here’s what I ate:

Grilled beehive - 5,000 LAK ($0.60)
Mung bean cake - 5,000 LAK ($0.60) for 2
Naem
Khao gee - 5,000 LAK ($0.60) for 3
Noodle rolls - 10,000 LAK ($1.20
Khao piak sen - 15,000 LAK ($1.80) per bowl

Phosi Market - One of the biggest  markets in Luang Prabang is Phosi Market. Unfortunately there wasn’t much pre-cooked food when we went there in the middle of the day, but luckily we found some amazing food.

Sai oua - Sai oua is the northern Laos version of sausage, and it’s a life-changer. This stall served some of the best sausage, not only that I’ve had in Laos, but in the world. You’ll find sai oua all over Luang Prabang. Price - 10,000 LAK ($1.20) each

Sticky rice feast - I desperately wanted a Luang Prabang sticky rice meal for lunch, so eventually after walking around a little we found the perfect spot. She had a variety of different Lao food stews to choose from and they all look great. All the dishes were  delicious, but the best Lao food of the meal for me was the bowl of aw bon (or bon) - made from taro leaves.
Total price - 40,000 LAK ($4.79)

Finally, for dinner to finish off this Luang Prabang street food tour, we headed to the evening market, located perpendicular to the night market walking street. We ordered a Mekong fish and then some very interesting Lao dishes from the curry stall. The algae salad was particularly interesting and delicious.
Fish - 80,000 LAK ($9.58), farmed fish were considerably cheaper
Dinner total - 60,000 LAK ($7.18)

It was an amazing day exploring Lao street food in Luang Prabang. Luang Prabang is a food paradise.

Lockdown could be eased early says UK scientific adviser- BBC News,"The success of the vaccination programme has made it possible to consider lifting the Covid restrictions at an earlier stage, according to one of the government's scientific advisors. 

Professor Mark Woolhouse told a parliamentary committee at Westminster that there were reasons to be more optimistic because there was more confidence in the scientific data compared to last year. 

But other government advisers sounded a far more cautious note. And the prime minister Boris Johnson said he was taking a “data not dates’ approach which would “go in stages”. 

Meanwhile In the first trial of its kind in the world  dozens of young and healthy volunteers between 18 and 30 years of age will be exposed to the coronavirus in a safe, controlled environment. 

The study will begin in the UK following approval from the clinical trials ethics body. Scientists hope it will give them a deeper understanding of the virus.

Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by health editor Hugh Pym, medical editor Fergus Walsh and deputy political editor Vicki Young.

Duckwrth - Fall Back (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"LA rapper Jared Lee doesn't care for overly specific genre designations or stylistic approaches. So even though newcomers might hear him as an MC, this dread-laden whirlwind, who dropped his first album 'I'm Uugly' in 2016, swerves around enough to be deemed a crazed black rocker or a postmodern R&B envelope-pusher or, simply put, an imaginative producer who can equally impress you with a guitar riff or synth line. True, he came up in South Central when Snoop, DJ Quick, Pac and others ruled the local radio, and their subject matter was gang banging. But thanks to his mom's heavy hand at child-rearing, Duckwrth stayed out of trouble and was more into X-Man and comic fantasy characters. He fell for music before too long, though. Wielding the kind of try-anything vibe you find in OutKast's best work, Duckwrth moves with the kind of experimental vibe you hear in Jaden Smith's work. That's what made his collab with The Kickdrums so unique. Spend an hour absorbing everything from the burb beats of ""Bernal Heights"" to  digi-groove of ""TAMAGOTCHI"" and you'll know why we were excited when he came in to roar through the new ""Fall Back."" Crank up our exclusive performance - Duckwrth gives it his all on this one.

“It was either Europe or death ”  One refugee family’s desperate search for safety,"Please  Subscribe: MSF International Channel For Updates  and (SOS).
WE  Will Really Appreciate Your Feedback . 
'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

“It was either Europe or death ”  One refugee family’s desperate search for safety

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

"'We wanted to achieve for those to follow', say black nurses who worked in 1960s NHS - BBC News","""You're caring for somebody and the abuse that you get - you don't let it affect you.""

When the NHS began, its survival relied on staff from immigrant backgrounds.

As the NHS celebrated its 75th birthday this week, the BBC's Amanda Kirton spoke to a group of black nurses who came to the UK from the Caribbean in the 1960s to work for the NHS.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47EEVgoY1VU

China orders closure of US consulate in Chengdu - BBC News,"China has ordered the closure of the US consulate in the south-western city of Chengdu, in a tit-for-tat escalation between the two countries.

China said the move was in response to the US closing its consulate in Houston, and accused staff in Chengdu of meddling in its internal affairs.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property.

Tensions have been rising between the US and China over several key issues.

President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong.

On Friday, Washington urged China to ""cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation"".

LYRICS:
Search me oh God, You know me
All of my thoughts and anxieties
You’re familiar with all my ways  
 
Where could I go from Your spirit
Nowhere to hide from Your presence 
I wouldn’t want to anyway
 
Let my life 
Be a sacrifice
I’ll hold back nothing
You can have the whole thing
With my arms stretched wide
I’ll lay down my pride
I’ll hold back nothing
You can have the whole thing
You can have the whole thing
 
You know the days set before me
All of the cracks in my story
And you still stick around
 
You picked up every fragment 
You gave me beauty for ashes
There is no separation now 
 
You can have it all
(Every part of me)
(Yes You can, yes You can)
(I lay it down at Your feet)

Sometimes the problems begin with our clothes, so I show you how to fix them using simple sewing tricks. For example, you can easily a teat o your jeans with a needle and a thread and you can also come up with your own cover-up if your clothes are too revealing. 
If you've accidentally lost your jeans' button in public, I show you how to make your own using a coin. 
But then again, we also have those annoying situations that we have no control over. Such as when you forget to lock the door in the bathroom, and someone just walks in without knocking. 
Or when you try to get a sip from your drink and the straw keeps dancing around, so you look funny trying to catch it with your tongue. And what about the times that you’ve made toast with jam on it and it always falls with the jam facing down! We all know how it feels.

Three stabbed to death in France 'terror attack' - BBC News,"Three people have been killed in a knife attack at a church in the French city of Nice, police say.

Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said there had been a ""terrorist attack at the heart of the Notre-Dame basilica"".

One elderly victim who had come to pray was ""virtually beheaded"". A suspect was shot and detained shortly afterwards.

Mr Estrosi spoke of ""Islamo-fascism"" and said the suspect had ""repeated endlessly 'Allahu Akbar' (God is greatest).""

President Emmanuel Macron is on his way to the scene. Anti-terror prosecutors have opened a murder inquiry and France raised its national security alert system to its highest level.

Mr Estrosi compared the attack to the recent murder of teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded close to his school outside Paris earlier this month.

Smart Emergency Hacks and Camping Tips For Parents,"Useful camping hacks and first aid tips for smart parents

Hey crafty moms and dads! If you decide to go camping with your family, take a look at these useful hacks and valuable gadgets to make your trip perfect. If you saw a splinter under your kid's skin, you can easily remove it with a syringe. When you are on the road and your kids are bored, they will undoubtedly ask you to grab their toys and gadgets from the trunk. If you don’t want to spend too much time opening the trunk when your kids want toys, then we will show you a clever way to store all the toys and devices in a car (right next to the back seat). When getting ready for a car trip, don’t forget about getting a small portable toilet for your children. It will make traveling for your kids way more comfortable and less stressful. 
In addition, you will see some random emergency hacks for parents. For example, if your kids get a slight injury while playing at the playground, you can use a tampon to stop the blood. If it happens at home, you can freeze a pack of marshmallows or other snacks and use it to reduce the bruise.

If there's one thing I know
My God won't let me go
I'm safe and so secure
And my soul will boast
Cos who else can part up the ocean?
Who else can mend up the broken?
Nobody but you, nobody but you, God
Who spoke the world into order?
Silenced the cries of the orphan?
Nobody but you, nobody but you, oh

Good God o

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 
⭐Qui est MSF?
MSF est une organisation humanitaire médicale internationale créée par des médecins et des journalistes en France en 1971. MSF fournit une aide dans près de 80 pays à des personnes dont la survie est menacée par la violence, la négligence ou la catastrophe, principalement en raison de conflits armés, d'épidémies, de malnutrition, d'exclusion de soins de santé ou catastrophes naturelles. MSF fournit une assistance indépendante et impartiale à ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. MSF a reçu le prix Nobel de la paix en 1999 et le prix King Hussein pour l'action humanitaire en 2004.

Quel est le travail de MSF?
Dans les situations d'urgence et leurs suites, MSF fournit des soins de santé, réhabilite et gère des hôpitaux et des cliniques, effectue des interventions chirurgicales, lutte contre les épidémies, mène des campagnes de vaccination, gère des centres d'alimentation pour les enfants souffrant de malnutrition et propose des soins de santé mentale. Au besoin, MSF construit également des puits et distribue de l'eau potable, et fournit des matériaux d'abri tels que des couvertures et des bâches en plastique.

MSF est-elle une agence des Nations Unies?
Non. MSF est une organisation indépendante qui fonctionne sans aucun programme politique, militaire ou religieux. Les activités de MSF ne sont liées à aucune des agences des Nations Unies. Cependant, MSF peut plaider auprès des Nations Unies sur les problèmes médicaux et humanitaires courants.

Où travaille MSF?
MSF travaille principalement dans les pays où elle a trouvé des services insuffisants pour répondre aux besoins médicaux d'une population. MSF est présent dans plus de 60 pays à travers le monde en Asie, en Afrique, en Europe et en Amérique latine.

Les services MSF sont-ils gratuits?
Oui. Tous les services MSF sont gratuits. MSF rejette l'idée que les pays pauvres méritent des soins médicaux de troisième ordre et s'efforce de fournir des soins de haute qualité aux patients et recherche du personnel hautement professionnel (médical et non médical). Par exemple, dans la mission MSF qui soigne les blessés de guerre irakiens, MSF couvre toutes les dépenses liées au traitement, y compris les frais de voyage, d'hébergement, etc.

D'où vient l'argent de MSF?
La clé de la capacité de MSF à agir de manière indépendante en réponse à une crise est son financement privé et indépendant. En 2015, 92% des revenus de MSF provenaient de sources privées. Plus de 5,7 millions de donateurs individuels et de fondations privées dans le monde ont rendu cela possible.

La présence de MSF est-elle toujours basée sur une base temporaire ou d'urgence?
MSF ne représente pas une alternative pour les formations sanitaires des pays où elle intervient. MSF essaie de combler le vide des besoins médicaux et humanitaires. Lorsque ces besoins sont satisfaits, MSF cède la place aux établissements de santé locaux et apporte son soutien aux autres populations dans le besoin.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground.

Algebra II on Khan Academy: Your studies in algebra 1 have built a solid foundation from which you can explore linear equations, inequalities, and functions. In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe. We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices. Don't let these big words intimidate you. We're on this journey with you!

'My husband cut off my hands with an axe' - BBC News,"Russia domestic abuse: In December 2017, Margarita Gracheva's husband took her into a forest and cut her hands off with an axe.

Her case has highlighted activists' fears that the softening of Russia's laws applying to domestic violence may be emboldening abusers.

First offences where the victim is not hospitalised are no longer treated as criminal offences and penalties have been reduced, under legal changes brought in in February 2017.

Her now ex-husband Dmitry Grachev has been convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Syria: Helping Displaced People Prepare for Another Brutal Winter,"More than two million displaced people living in northwestern Syria are bracing themselves for an impending winter that will exacerbate their already unbearable living conditions. Every winter, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees the season's alarming health impacts. “My son is constantly suffering from stomach aches and colds,” said Ahmad Mahmoud Merhi. “My other child’s temperature reached 40 degrees [104 degrees Fahrenheit]. A rash spread in his mouth, hands, and legs due to the fever. But we couldn’t afford to take him to the doctor.” 

MSF teams are currently undertaking a range of activities to mitigate the impact of winter weather on displaced people in the region, including distributing kits of clothes and blankets to approximately 3,000 families and installing tent flooring, roof isolation, and thermal insulation for 3,900 families, to prevent flooding and help protect them from freezing temperatures. While humanitarian needs are increasing in Syria, funding to address them is drastically decreasing. More funding and additional support from other organizations are urgently needed for winterization activities, before winter arrives. Read more at https://bit.ly/31nbQ0T

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

LYRICS: MI Amore

Intro
Lock me up, take my pride away
Shake my hand, pour the chardonnay

Verse 1
To the left of July, I finally caved to the careless
Got a bad idea for two, but rolled the dice
(Rolled the dice)
You got me running, pinching pennies, like I’m a fool
(Just a getaway, long shot getaway)
You got me running, trying to sell me Hollywood
(Just a getaway, long shot getaway)

Pre-Chorus
So can you please help me man
I didn’t think that they would tie my hands, there’s a
High price to pay for fame
Put the shame on you for your hollow ways

Chorus
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
It’s killin’ me
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
She’s the best of me

Verse 2
As I walk alone oh I hope I get justice
I carry one-dollar bills like it’s a choice
You got me running, pinching pennies, like I’m a fool
(Just a getaway, long shot getaway)
You got me running, running all over Hollywood
(Just a getaway, long shot getaway)

Pre-Chorus
So can you please help me man
I didn’t think that they would tie my hands, there’s a
High price to pay for fame
Put the shame on you for your hollow ways

Chorus
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
It’s killin’ me
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
She’s the best of me

Post-Chorus
Can’t put up a fight
Til I’m away from you
Can’t put up a fight
Til I’m away from you
(Away from you)
(Away from you)

Bridge
Lock me up, take my pride away
Shake my hand, pour the chardonnay
(3x)

Chorus
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
It’s killin’ me
Been nice to know ya
But don’t come between,
Mi amore
She’s the best of me

Post-Chorus
Can’t put up a fight
Til I’m away from you
Can’t put up a fight
Til I’m away from you",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F8SWmYeRbQ

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it’s no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her Father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley’s main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FLTNUYAgGg

Lyrics: 

If you curse me then I will bless you
If you hurt me I will forgive
And if you hate me then I will love you
I choose the Jesus way

If you’re helpless I will defend you
And if you’re burdened I’ll share the weight
And if you’re hopeless then let me show you
There’s hope in the Jesus way

I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I’ll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure 
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way

If you strike me I will embrace you
And if you chain me I’ll sing His praise
And if you kill me my home is heaven
For I choose the Jesus way 

I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I’ll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure 
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way

I choose surrender
I choose to love
Oh God my Savior
You’ll always be enough
I choose forgiveness
I choose grace
I choose to worship
No matter what I face

I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way

I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I’ll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure 
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way

I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I’ll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure 
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way
Oh I choose the Jesus way

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Colombia decriminalises abortions in first 24 weeks of pregnancy - BBC News,"Abortions have been allowed in Colombia in cases of rape, when the woman's life is at risk, or if the pregnancy is not viable since 2006

But new laws mean that no one will be prosecuted for having an abortion in the first 24 weeks.

Reaction to the decision has been mixed in the mostly Catholic country. Pro-choice activists are celebrating the change in law but the Catholic Church has spoken out against the decision.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

David Ferrucci led the team that built Watson, the IBM question-answering system that beat the top humans in the world at the game of Jeopardy. He is also the Founder, CEO, and Chief Scientist of Elemental Cognition, a company working engineer AI systems that understand the world the way people do.

"Coronavirus: Spain death toll tops 2,000 - BBC News","The death toll in Spain has reached 2,182, the government has announced, after 462 people passed away in the past 24 hours.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Sunday a ban on all gatherings of more than two people who aren't family. It came just days after police in the state of Bavaria shut down a number of public ""corona parties"", organised by young people on social media. Premier Markus Söder called the gatherings ""a real threat"".

15 LIFE HACKS WITH CRAYONS,"CRAYON IDEAS

Check out these amazing crayon ideas to boost your creativity and imagination! This time I'll show you some pretty awesome ways to recycle old broken crayons into something truly beautiful. You can make super cute colorful candles, paintings, animal-shaped or Lego-shaped chalks, wonderful pendants and cool prints for your T-shirts using parchment!

And here's what we need to make beautiful crayon candles!

Old candles (if you want to color your candles a light color, I suggest you use your old white candles)
Candle Wicks
Recycled Jars
Crayons (The Crayola brand works the best)
Candle scents. Optional (please don’t use perfume since it is highly flammable)
A container to melt wax
Pencil
Paper towels
 
1. Choose a glass or metal container you want to place your candle in and make sure it is clean and dry.

2. Place the wick in your container. You can wrap the top of the wick around a pencil and place it on the rim, and this will keep your wick centered.

3. Next cut up your recycled old candle wax and place in the candle making pot. Try and isolate your wick and leave it out of the melting process. 

4. Place your melting pot on the stove and turn the heat to low. Make sure to constantly watch your wax since it tends to melt quickly and burn. 

5. Add one or two crayons depending on the amount of wax you use. 

6. Melt your mixture and pour into your prepared candle containers. 

7. Let cool and trim the wick.

Human trials for UK coronavirus vaccine this week - BBC News,"The government is ""throwing everything"" at developing a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.

He told the daily Downing Street briefing that human trials for a vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, would begin on Thursday.

He also addressed the shortage of protective gear for the NHS, saying the government was talking to thousands of suppliers, but not all could deliver.

Labour said there was a ""gap"" between government words and reality.

Meanwhile the UK has recorded another 823 coronavirus hospital deaths - taking the total number to 17,337.

'Animal plus technology equals human' - BBC News,"No other country in the world has more robots or is putting more money in to robotic research than Japan. Japanese companies already employ more than a quarter of a million industrial robots, the most in the world. But it is Japan's rapidly ageing population, and shrinking workforce that is driving the development of new robotic technology - to care for the elderly and keep older people going when their own bodies give out.

What Would It Be Like to Meet Your First Ancestors?,"Meeting your first ancestors who were apes would be like hanging out with the ultimate primal crew. Picture swinging through the trees, grooming each other's fur, and communicating with grunts and gestures. They'd be the OG squad of the animal kingdom, showing you the ropes of survival in the wild. You might even share some surprising similarities, like a love for bananas or a knack for mischief. It'd be like reconnecting with your wild side and getting a glimpse into where you came from.

What If You Could Swim on the Moon,"If there was a swimming pool on the Moon, could a person swim in it? Think about it! We’ve sent satellites beyond our solar system. We’ve walked on the moon, and we’ll soon do the same on Mars. But we’ve missed one more important task, and it’ll take a bright mind like yours to make it happen: what if we swam on the moon?

So, you decide to build the first-ever pool on the moon! Could it work? How different would lunar swimming be? You need oxygen inside, but you still want lunar gravity. Otherwise, your new idea of moon swimming will just turn into Earth swimming, and that’s not fun or fresh. And the walls must be transparent, like a giant bubble!

TIMESTAMPS:
The plan 2:01
What would it be like? 3:15
Will you leap from the water like a dolphin? 4:33

"DEATH LEVEL RAMEN in Tokyo!! 🌶️ 💀 w/ Ramen Beast (He's Eaten 4,000 Bowls of Ramen!!)","🇯🇵 Japanese Street Food in Osaka: https://youtu.be/3zLvByt52go?si=DOjWs1-7VCsTtN5k

TOKYO, JAPAN - Today I’m in Tokyo along with my friend Abram, Ramen Beast (follow him: https://www.instagram.com/ramen_beast/). He’s eaten over 4,000 bowls of ramen across Japan and he’s taking us to 3 of his favorites in Tokyo. We’re in for some top level Japanese ramen today, and a nice variety of different styles and flavors. 

Ramen is one of the ultimate Japanese foods to eat and something I love about it is there’s so much freedom and every ramen restaurant has its own unique character, personality, and style.

Places we went: 
00:00 Intro
01:24 E-chan - Japanese Ramen 
14:07 Aidaya - Japanese Tsukemen, Dipping Ramen 
27:42 Shibuya Crossing 
28:38 Lashowhan - Extreme Spicy Chinese Ramen

E-chan (えーちゃん食堂 https://maps.app.goo.gl/D7v3aPTPJGYqc3uTA) - Our first bowl of ramen was a class, good clean flavor broth with hand-made noodles. This spot only opens for breakfast and sells out in 2 - 3 hours. Price - 1,000 JPY ($6.22) per bowl 

Aidaya (あいだや https://maps.app.goo.gl/GA9Urh7UXRMyDn4R6 ) - Next up on this ramen tour in Tokyo we’re eat tsukemen, the dipping style of ramen, and this place does it extraordinarily well. The sukiyaki wagyu was a bonus! Price - 2,300 JPY ($14.30) per set 

Lashowhan (担々麺 ラーメン 辣椒漢 https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y4v9mwjt6Sx3aTSW7) - Finally, Beast takes me to eat an extremely spicy Chinese style dry ramen. Price - 1,100 JPY ($6.84) per bowl

'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Nurses Around the World Sent Us Videos

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

AWESOME HACKS AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES IDEAS || 5-Minute Tips For Smart Students,"Back to School ideas and hacks to help you pass the time and solve all of your problems.
Let’s face it, we all disliked school at one point in life, and most of us didn’t know all those fantastic hacks that will help make our life more comfortable and save time. In this video, I show you some brilliant tips and tricks every student must try in school. 
If you’ve accidentally written something on a whiteboard with a permanent marker, you can easily remove it by scribbling on top with a regular whiteboard marker. After you’re done, you just gotta use the eraser to wipe it clean, and voila. 
Sometimes in school, they give us more books than we anticipated that day – and that leaves us with no way to carry them home with us. If you’ve been in that situation, I show you a simple way to turn your hoodie into a useful backpack. 
Watch the entire video to find out smart ways to cheat on a test and many more useful hacks for everyday life.

What Will Happen If You Eat Nothing for 7 Days,"How to Fast. What if you decided to quit eating for an entire week? Would it be dangerous for your body? Nowadays, many people prefer to stick to periodical water fasting, so they don't consume any food and drink apart from water. 
Water fasting should last for no more than a couple of days, and you should consult with a doctor beforehand. Among its benefits are lower blood pressure, improved insulin and leptin sensitivity, lower cholesterol levels, and weight loss. The first and most important thing is not to jump into a long session of water fasting right away. Your first experience with it should last for about 2 days. As you plan your 7-day water fasting, try to pick a low-stress time in your life. Doing this during exam season or when you're moving house isn't the best time.

SUMMARY
-For the first 6 hours of your “no food” period, everything's going to be just fine.
-After 6 hours, your body begins to starve since there's not enough glucose in your blood.
-After 3 “no food” days, your brain goes to another extreme and starts to break down your body's protein. This happens because proteins release amino acids, which can be converted into the glucose your body so desperately needs.
-After one “no food” week, your immune system becomes extremely weak because it isn’t receiving any vitamins or minerals.
-Starvation may lead to death after almost a month or up to 70 days.
-There's one rule when it comes to water fasting: you don't consume any food and drink apart from water. According to specialists, water fasting should last for no more than a couple of days, and a consultation with a doctor beforehand is obligatory.
-If you want to water fast because of the weight loss factor, you have another option: intermittent fasting. This means eating nothing (or just a few calories) for a certain period of time and then eating as usual for another period.
-The first and most important thing is not to jump into a long session of water fasting right away. Your first experience with it should last for about 2 days. Listen to your body carefully during your first water fasting.
-When you're done with your fasting, you should break it slowly. Easily digested foods like soups, juices, pureed fruit, white rice, and mashed potatoes are the best products for your first 2 days.

The Most Absurd Beauty Trends from Times Gone By,"Back in the Victorian era, beauty trends were like stepping into a dark and eerie fairy tale. Pale, almost ghostly complexions were all the rage, with ladies going to extreme lengths using lead-based powders that probably did more harm than good. Then there were those creepy, doll-like porcelain masks that some women wore to achieve an unnaturally flawless face – it's like living in a real-life haunted porcelain doll collection. The obsession with tight-lacing corsets gave off major Tim Burton vibes, reshaping bodies into these unnatural, almost caricature-like silhouettes. And let's not forget the allure of arsenic-laced beauty potions; apparently, a toxic glow was considered fashionable. In hindsight, it's a good thing we've moved on from those hauntingly bizarre beauty rituals! 👻💄

Thai court dissolves reformist party that won election | BBC News,"A Thai court has ordered the dissolution of the reformist party which won the most seats and votes in last year’s election - but was blocked from forming a government.

The ruling also banned Move Forward's charismatic young former leader Pita Limjaroenrat and 10 other senior figures from politics for 10 years.

The verdict from the Constitutional Court was expected, after its ruling in January that Move Forward's campaign promise to change royal defamation laws was unconstitutional.

The court had said changes to the notoriously harsh lese majeste law was tantamount to calling for the destruction of the constitutional monarchy.

"IF YOU THINK YOU'RE UNLUCKY, WATCH THIS","KITCHEN FAILS EVERYBODY CAN RELATE TO

Check out a collection of various fails that could happen to you literally everywhere. Let’s start with cooking fails! Real kitchen disasters happen rarely but cause a lot of troubles! Have you ever spent hours cleaning your kitchen after using the mixer without splash guard? Usually, it ends up with splashed cake batter around your kitchen, your hair, and t-shirt.  Do not shake a bottle of soda before opening to avoid getting splashed. One fail is when baby spinach significantly reduces its size on its own when cooking. Is it a joke? Another problem is when you want to enjoy pizza and try to bite it but the topping slides out of it. 
Check out a compilation of funny food moment and recognize yourself! Sometimes you are not ready to share your favorite cake with anyone. We have a perfect trick - cut a small piece for your friend and eat the rest by yourself. If you want to borrow a chocolate bar from your friend, leave the note “Sorry! Hunger made me do it!’’. This will be a funny way to excuse but don’t forget to return the chocolate bar next time. Have you ever noticed that when you are hungry and want to warm up your lunch in the microwave it takes too much time? In fact, it’s only 1 minute, but when you are hungry it’s too long.
As a bonus, you will find a collection of awkward moments every girl can relate to. Have you ever used a car window as a mirror in the street? What an embarrassing moment when a window suddenly opens. It’s a real fail to find anything in your bag and there is always one bobby pin that you forgot in your hair. Ugh!

UK Election 2019: Brexit and the NHS dominate election campaign debate- BBC News,"The Conservatives and Labour have been outlining their main pitch to voters. The Prime Minister Boris Johson in his first major speech of the campaign said a Conservative government would unite the country and ""level up"" the prospects for people with massive investment in health, better infrastructure, more police, and a green revolution. But he said the key issue to solve was Brexit. Meanwhile Labour vowed to outspend the Tories on the NHS in England. 

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also faced questions over his position on allowing a second referendum on Scottish independence. Today at the start of a two-day tour of Scotland, he said wouldn't allow one in the first term of a Labour government but later rowed back saying it wouldn't be a priority in the early years. 

Sophie Raworth presents tonight's BBC News at Ten and unravels the day's events with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, health editor Hugh Pym and Scotland editor Sarah Smith.

PHOTO HACKS FOR BEGINNERS || 25 WAYS TO CREATE A PERFECT SHOT,"PHOTOGRAPHY TRICKS EVERY INSTAGRAMER USES

It’s no secret that the influencer culture revolves around taking stunning photos. So, in this video, I show you some brilliant ideas to try on your social media and make your posts go viral using some of these hacks. 
Take the camera lens, and draw a perfect circle using its dimensions, then cut out a couple of hearts and stars and you can take brilliant pictures with those stencils. 
For better outdoor lighting, you can add some kitchen foil close to your skin to reflect the sun. Though, if the camera flash is blinding, then you can use a plastic bag to help absorb some of the bright light. 
Another viral photo idea is to take an ordinary picture frame, add a few heart-shaped stickers on it and then ask someone to place it in front of their camera while they’re taking photos of you. Little blurred out hearts will appear and it’ll be like a real-life filter. 
You can also apply some lip-balm all around the camera lens to blur out the edges of the camera while taking pics and have the center solely focused on your face. 
Stay tuned until the end to get inspiration for your social media posts. You can try my slow-motion secret ideas or the confusing perspective photography tricks you can try with your smartphone.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R3qGXXNjfI
Jacob Blake: Father says man shot in Wisconsin is 'paralysed - BBC News,"The lawyers for the family of a black man shot in the back by police in the US state of Wisconsin say he will need a ""miracle"" to walk again.

Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times opening the door of his car in Kenosha. At least one of the bullets went through his spinal cord, lawyers said.

Several people were reportedly shot on Tuesday night amid continuing unrest following the police shooting.

The governor of Wisconsin is sending more National Guard troops to Kenosha.

As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs.

Money is a currency we use to exchange value for goods or services in our modern-day society. For most of us, it’s a number written in our bank apps. But it wasn’t always like that, of course.

Pressure to delay primary school return after London U-turn - BBC News,"Most primary schools in London are to remain closed at the start of the January term after the government bowed to protests and pressure from local authorities.

The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson dropped plans to keep them open after councils warned it could lead to disaster and threatened legal action.

Rivian's Max Koff | Season 5 Episode 8 | The InEVitable,"On this episode, Jonny and Ed chat with Rivian director of vehicle dynamics Max Koff. Despite his youthful appearance, Max is one of the first team members at Rivian and has been a part of their EV journey for 10+ years. He was hired right out of engineering school by Rivian founder RJ Scaringe, back when the goal was *not* an EV truck. In his time with Rivian, he has leveraged his engineering expertise to lead the coordination and integration of several vehicle subsystems within the Rivian R1T and R1S, so they work in concert to deliver the electric trucks impressive on- and off-road performance.  Max was instrumental in developing the R1 platform and getting the R1T and R1S to market. It's an entertaining episode, as we cover how Max arrived at Rivian, some of the key decisions made around both the R1T and R1S, the state of the EV space (including cold weather and towing performance of electric trucks) and of course, what Max does (and drives) in his spare time. Tune in and tell your friends! ➡️https://bit.ly/3wguMdF

#googletranslate #workfromhome #itried  
So I found this idea floating around on YouTube that claims you can make about $30 every 10 minutes on Google Translate. Which is supposed to make you up to $900 a day working only 4 hours per day.
They promise it's FREE to start, all you need is a PayPal account to receive the money, so it works Worldwide. One of the videos got over 4 million views in a year. Here's another video with almost 2 Million views, so I guess a lot of people liked this method, let's try it out today!

Okay, let's jump right in and go to translate.google.com. This platform is indeed totally free to use. Here, you can easily translate between different languages. Just pick your language and type in what you want to translate. Then, in another box, it'll show you the translation. You can choose from lots of different languages too.",Education,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TrL4ZWkMKQ

Venezuela crisis:'There is simply no water' - BBC News,"Water shortages caused by a six-day power cut in Venezuelan cities hit the headlines earlier this month, but for many in the country, dry taps are nothing new.
The electrical outage affected pumps that deliver water to homes around the capital, Caracas. Some homes had no water for days.
Families gathered up plastic bottles to fill them with hosepipes at public parks, and visited a mountain on the outskirts of the city to collect water.
Caracas resident Margarita told the BBC's Will Grant that the recent shortages are part of a wider problem.

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

GAYLE - luv starved (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Gayle - luv starved. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Gayle is putting the punk back into pop. Her acidic “abcdefu,” which weaponized the alphabet against exes everywhere, exploded on alt radio, Hits 1, TikTok - anyplace fierce emotions are appreciated, actually. But the Texas native turned Nashville resident is no one-trick pony. Her debut EP, ‘a study of the human experience,’ also delivers angsty lyricism, the kind only a 17-year-old who’s actually going through the pains of growing up could pull off. It makes sense that worries about sex, love and heartbreak resonate with her peers. But her tunes are also impressing members of the previous generation, those who grew up with Paramore on the radio. With Olivia Rodrigo in her DMs and dates supporting emo royalty My Chemical Romance, Gayle is reminding us that guitars, eyeliner, and thrashing breakdowns are back in the mainstream. “I talk about what I’m passionate about,” she proclaims. “And if that pisses people off, then OK.” We love that energy, which she brought to our DSCVR performances of “luv starved” and “sleeping with my friends.” Whenever her eyes appeared from behind her messy bangs to make contact with the camera, that “don’t f with me attitude” was front and center. Prepare to be knocked around a bit.

"If You See a Blue Porch Ceiling, This Is What It Means","A Canadian blogger managed to turn a paperclip into a real house. He decided to run an experiment in which he would swap objects to finally get a house. It took him a bit less than a year and 14 steps to fulfill his dream. The world’s largest treehouse, also known as The Minister’s Tree House, is located in Tennessee. The house is supported by 6 large oaks, and the structure required about 250,000 nails to clip all the parts together.

Tamera - Introducing Tamera | Vevo DSCVR,"Introducing Tamera | Vevo DSCVR

Like many artists of her generation, Tamera studied at the University of Beyoncé. When listening to her Afrobeats-tinted R&B and scrolling through her well-manicured Insta page, it’s not hard to imagine that the rising Brit singer actually took classes in The Art of Sasha Fierce. Each move has been a wise one. Raised just outside of London in Kent, young Tamera was molded into a confident vocalist by her church minister grandma. “She would push me to sing in front of other people,” the appreciative granddaughter recalls. After navigating the wild world of competitive singing TV shows and an early label deal, the then-teenager emerged with an eye on the indie route. R&B is the “main thread” of her sound, she says, but early singles such as “Wickedest” revealed an inclination to mix son clave riddims and the various guitar sounds of West African pop into her intoxicating sonic potions. With only one EP to her name - 2021’s ‘Aphrodite’ - Tamera cultivated a community of like-sounding UK artists such as Tay Iwar (“Good Love,” “Honest”) and DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023 alum Nonso Amadi (“Shivers”). Not to mention, her 100k+ followers love the way she mixes positive vibes with lavish aesthetics on her socials; it’s all about manifesting success after all. To that point, “Poison” might be Tamera’s strongest release to date, a zephyr of soft keys, undulating percussion, and romantic tension. She put a bow on 2023 with her ‘L.I.T.’ EP. “Bamba” is its closing track, and a marker of great things to come.

Q - Take Me Where Your Heart Is (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Q - Take Me Where Your Heart Is. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Considering how difficult it is to search Q’s name, it's impressive that his “Take Me Where Your Heart Is” video has more than a million views. Both D’Angelo’s progressive R&B and Childish Gambino’s clever experimentalism helped shade Q’s ‘Forest Green’ and ‘The Shave Experiment' EPs. The singer has said both artists inspire him. Also influential are his musician parents, Jamaican immigrants who had success in the dancehall scene. By the way, you can thank Q’s dad for giving his son the unusual first name. Like many artists of his generation, the 21-year-old is open about his anxieties; he’s said that the studio is one of the few places he finds peace of mind. Q grew up in South Florida, where the rap scene initially had him emulating local hip-hop heroes like Kodak Black and Ski Mask the Slump God. Around age 17 he turned to “alternative sounds,” which provided him with more artistic control. That decision has worked out nicely. Complex recently called him one of 2020's most exciting rising artists. We fully agree. Q hasn’t played songs from either EP at a proper show yet, so it was great seeing the DSCVR rendition of “Take Me Where Your Heart Is.” He has another project on the way, too, and the “Want"" performance will give you a feel for a new upbeat retro sound. When it comes to Q, we can’t wait to hear what’s in store.

"QAnon, coronavirus and the conspiracy cult - BBC News","A bizarre conspiracy theory has surged in popularity in the US since the pandemic, according to exclusive research seen by the BBC.

QAnon and its believers say that Donald Trump is here to save the world from an evil cabal of paedophiles and it’s had a surprising level of interest around the world from Brazil to Germany, the UK and Indonesia.

And this week Twitter announced it would delete 7,000 QAnon-related accounts, saying it hoped the action would help to prevent ""offline harm"".

BBC Population Correspondent Stephanie Hegarty has spoken to QAnon followers and their families to find out why this cultish conspiracy has gained so much traction.

Once Rain Didn't Stop for 2 Million Years,"What if it never stopped raining? Are you sick and tired of rains that haven't stopped for weeks on end? Then consider yourself lucky that you didn't live in the Triassic Period, around 234 million years ago. That was the beginning of a really long rainy season...

At the beginning of the Triassic period, the planet was sweltering, with the oceans hotter than your bathtub and the air full of carbon dioxide from constant volcanic eruptions. And the supercontinent Pangea was mostly a vast stretch of flat and dry land. However, this couldn't last forever. And approximately 234 million years ago, long-awaited rain fell. And everything would have been perfect if these rain hadn't continued for 2 million years!

SUMMARY:
- Around 252 million years ago, 70% of terrestrial vertebrates, as well as 90% of marine creatures, were wiped off the surface of the planet. Animal and plant life on Earth couldn't fully recover from this catastrophe for the next 10 million years.
- Sulfur emissions from burning coal made the oceans acidic, and this killed most marine species. Acid rains destroyed forests. Bacteria that lived on dead bodies started to produce hydrogen sulfide, toxic gas which finished off the remaining species.
- Surprisingly, scientists managed to discover evidence of humid climate in entirely different places on the planet. This could only mean one thing: 234 million years ago, it was raining all over the world.  
- Approximately one or two million years before the ""wet season"" started, there were several massive volcanic eruptions on the territory of modern-day British Columbia and Alaska. These eruptions lasted for a whopping 5 million years!
- After the volcanic activity continued for about one million years, Earth's atmosphere became so humid and warm that rain eventually managed to reach even the central parts of the supercontinent. The season of rains started.
- There are many misconceptions about dinosaurs. First of all, forget about the image of a huge predator towering over trees. A significant number of dinosaurs were not bigger than a good old turkey!
- Due to climate change, plant life on Earth changed dramatically. It thrived in the new tropical humid climate. Tall trees and lush greenery started to grow in abundance. And dinosaurs began to increase in size.
- After revitalizing the planet, the monsoon season finally came to an end. The volcanic eruptions were slowing down at that time, and this also played a significant role in the stabilization of climate.
- After the two-million-year-long rainfall, the plant life of Earth changed dramatically. There appeared many types of conifers which then spread all over the place.

EU diplomats back entry for non-essential travel - BBC News,"EU ambassadors have recommend reopening borders to people from countries with low Covid rates – with a list to be agreed this week.

Diplomats said visitors should be allowed to come from countries with an incidence rate of below 75 cases per 100,000 people.

Under those terms UK travellers would be eligible, but there are concerns about the Indian Covid variant in the country. 

Some EU countries want to see how the surge of cases in the UK related to the Indian variant plays out.

Saving Lives that Give Life: Preventing Maternal Deaths and Advancing Women's Health,"The Forum at HSPH

Investing resources in the health and well-being of women benefits societies in multiple ways. Recent years have witnessed the global development community focused increasingly on advancing women's health. Yet, many challenges -- some life threatening -- persist. More than 280,000 women died in 2010 during pregnancy and from childbirth complications, according to the United Nations. Many of those deaths and injuries were preventable. Access to quality health care and health education remains crucial. This event was presented in collaboration with The Huffington Post.",Education,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anWzkQylvs
Why We Laugh at Awkward Moments,"What about chuckling at a joke you didn’t think was funny or even understand? The list goes on and on when we’re talking about situations when we laugh, but they don’t have anything to do with something being funny. Why do we do it?

Laughing in the awkward, negative sense often helps us deal with things that mostly stem from fear. Dr. Margee Kerr, a sociologist from the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in the study of fear and wrote a book called, ""Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear,"" says that “we laugh at things like this because they violate our expectations.” 

TIMESTAMPS: 
What percentage of laughter is a genuine response to a joke? 1:20
Why do we sometimes laugh when we’re uncomfortable? 2:19
What is the relationship between fear and laughter? 3:15
Why do certain types of laughter scare us? 4:08
Why do we sometimes laugh when we’re sad? 5:08
What the Inappropriate Effect is 6:13
How laughter ups our tolerance for pain 8:15

#laughing #psychology 

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- Researchers found that only 10 to 20% of laughter is a genuine response to a shared joke. So, that 80-90% of unaccounted for laughter is when people are laughing because something isn’t funny.
- We get scared when things don’t go as we expect them to. In an extreme sense, we could actually be laughing because we’re in physical shock and are in denial about the situation we’re witnessing.
- It’s a way to mentally run away from our fear and literally “laugh it off.” It’s a comforting mechanism to calm down our mind in a high-stress situation.
- It’s said that fear and laughter are very closely related when we’re talking about the mental state. The brain might use these two things interchangeably in this highly charged state.
- We also sometimes laugh when we’re sad. Our brain responds to this emotional overload by releasing stress in the form of laughter.
- There’s actually a term in psychology for this laugh reaction. It’s aptly called the Inappropriate Effect. By allowing us to laugh in the face of a stressor, our subconscious is trying to soothe us and assure us that everything is fine.
- Psychologically speaking, motivations for nervous laughter can be for reasons like embarrassment, discomfort, or confusion. It’s a verifiable physical reaction to anxiety, stress, tension, and disorientation.
- Laughter has also been known to up our tolerance for pain. This means that laughter really is the best medicine!

Has Taiwan got a safety problem?  BBC News,"In the past year, Taiwan has been hit by a string of deadly disasters, including two plane crashes, a chemical blast, a fire that killed 6 fire fighters and, in June, an explosion at a water park. 
These are not simply accidents. Behind each case, accident investigators found either an error of judgment, a law violation, or negligence was to blame.  In some of the cases, existing safety laws had simply been ignored.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Why Mediaeval Europeans Slept Inside Boxes,"The next time you feel like complaining that your bed isn't comfortable enough and the room is way too small, just think of those people who had to sleep in boxes. Until the early 19th century, that was a common thing in Europe. And no, it wasn't just the way the poorest people lived - even the nobility had to resort to this unusual sleep situation. If you need at least 8 hours of sleep to feel great the next day, you wouldn't have a great time in preindustrial Europe because they used to sleep in shifts!

When it is safe to do so, NASA’s Jeff Williams will open the hatch and be the first to enter the inflatable experimental habitat.

Trump nominates religious conservative Amy Coney Barrett to Supreme Court - BBC News,"President Trump has announced that he is nominating the conservative federal judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the US Supreme Court.

The nomination will trigger a bitter political battle in Congress as Republicans try to have Judge Barrett confirmed by the Senate, before the Presidential and Congressional elections in November. 

The US Supreme Court’s nine justices serve for life and their rulings can shape public policy long after the President who nominated them has left office.
 
Judge Barrett is described as a “devout Catholic” who believes that “life begins at conception”.   That’s made her a favourite among religious conservatives in America who hope to overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling which legalised abortion across the United States.

She’s been nominated to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of the liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who became famous for her defence of abortion and women’s rights.

"Gene Hackman and wife both died of natural causes, but several days apart | BBC News","Hollywood actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, both died of natural causes, coroners have said.
 
Hackman's cause of death has been ruled as heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease contributing to his death.
 
Arakawa, 65, died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - a disease carried by infected rodents.
 
Authorities said she likely died days before her 95-year-old husband, and it's possible he was not aware because of his Alzheimer's.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Comparison: Top Most Spicy Things Ever,"What's the most savory and spiciest food? Well, first of all, do you know what the Scoville Scale and Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) are? They were named for scientist Wilbur Scoville in 1912 for measuring a chili pepper’s pungency and heat. For example, sweet bell pepper is called so by no chance: it’s the most innocent of the pepper family. It has zero Scoville Heat Units.

Pimento pepper is otherwise called cherry pepper. It’s sweet and only mildly spicy, measuring only 500 Scoville Units on the Scoville Scale. There are 79 different varieties of Thai pepper, but all of them range from 50,000 to 100,000 on the Scoville rating. The hot and mighty Carolina Reaper — the absolute champion of hot peppers. It’s a current record-holder for being the spiciest pepper in the world. Measuring at almost 2.2 million Scovilles, this pepper would probably burn your tongue through. But it's still not the hottest spice!

"GIANT LOBSTER TOM YUM!! Insane Thai Street Food at Night Market in Bangkok, Thailand!","Can Ramon and I finish the GIANT Lobster Tom Yum food challenge!?

Talad Rot Fai Ratchada (ตลาดรถไฟรัชดา) - Also known as the train market, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok. It’s especially popular on the weekend when a younger crowd flocks to the market to eat the latest Thai street food trends, and hang out with friends.

The train market has in recent months become famous for its giant food - you’ll find a number of giant Thai dishes to try like egg noodles, pork bone soup, and now the massive lobster tom yum - possibly the world’s biggest bowl of tom yum?

Diaw Goong Rot Fai Restaurant (เตี๋ยวกุ้งรถไฟ) - This is the name of the restaurant, and when we ordered they started preparing the lobster.

Giant Lobster Tom Yum (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำโครตกุ้งมังกรยักษ์) - They serve it in a basin, like a mini bathtub, not even a bowl. And it’s HUGE. They layer in the fish, squid, mussels, shrimp, and finally a giant lobster goes on top, followed by all the tom yum soup broth. Honestly, the seafood isn’t the freshest or best quality, but you don’t really go to eat a bathtub of seafood for the quality - you go for the insaneness of it.
Price - 2,800 THB ($89.27)

Here are the other Thai street foods we tried on this tour:

Seafood griddle cakes (ขนมครกทะเล)
Price - 60 THB ($1.91)

Green mango crab egg salad (ยำมะม่วงไข่ปูทะเล)
Price - 150 THB ($4.78)

Watermelon shake (แตงโมปั่น)
Price - 60 THB ($1.91)

Lyrics

Get ready for it
Get ready for it

You said whatever you put out there
Whatever you put out there is gonna come back
You said whenever you are ready
Whenever you are ready just let it all out
And I know cos the enemy inside me
Cos the enemy inside me is holding me back
But we know there’s something in the silence
There’s something in the silence

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
You said there’s only one place left to find
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it

You said every life is a lesson
Are you a fool or a Kingsman?
Cos only you know
Hold on cos the volume is rising
Yeah the volume is rising so you better hold on

The night is young
Until it’s over
Until it’s over
The night is young
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow

Get ready for it
Yeah get ready for it
You said there’s only one place left to find
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

The night is young
Until it’s over
Until it’s over
The night is young
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow

Get ready for it

I’ll hold your hand
With good intentions
With good intentions
I’ll hold your hand
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
You said there’s only one place left to find
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

‘Italian’ purees in UK supermarkets likely to contain Chinese forced-labour tomatoes | BBC News,"“Italian” tomato purees sold by several UK supermarkets appear to contain tomatoes grown and picked in China using forced labour, the BBC has found.

A total of 17 products, most of them own-brands sold in UK and German retailers, are likely to contain Chinese tomatoes - testing commissioned by the BBC World Service showed.

Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where their production is linked to forced labour by Uyghur and other largely Muslim minorities. 

The UN reports the Chinese state - which views these minorities as a security risk - of torture and abuse. 

China denies it forces people to work in the tomato industry and says workers’ rights are protected by law. It says the UN report is based on “disinformation and lies”.

All the supermarkets whose products we tested dispute our findings.

Aime Simone - Give Me Love or Give Me Nothing (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Aime Simone - Give Me Love Or Give Me Nothing (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Aime Simone gave us an adorable answer when we asked him to list some of his inspirations. “My daughter"" said the French newcomer. Sometimes it’s easy to forget there’s a whole person behind an artist, especially one of Simone’s profile. His beats, typically employing riveting trap hi-hats and distorted 808s, hit hard; his personal style consists of flamboyant fabrics and a totally cutting-edge haircut. In a previous life, Simone was part of the LA fashion scene (hence his stellar English). That said, his self-labeled “post-pop” sound carries a tenderness reminiscent of Billie Eilish, another inspiration of his. So maybe the cute shoutout to his daughter shouldn’t be that surprising. Although Paris is Simone’s home city, Berlin was the place where his musical career took root. He recorded his debut album there. ‘Say Yes, Say No’ arrived in 2020 and quickly garnered buzz in the German club scene. You can hear his sonic breadth on the two album standouts. “In This Dark Time” is borderline emo rap, whereas “Shining Light” glides along with airiness and finger snaps. Both tracks have earned more than 10 million Spotify streams. The former track was embraced by pro-Ukraine activists. The new ‘Oh Glory’ album further embraces life’s more shadowy moments, but on “Give Me Love or Give Me Nothing” he finds the power to issue an ultimatum. You can really feel the catharsis when the final chorus hits in this DSCVR performance. Guy has a lot of heart.

Why No One Should Use Airport USB Charging Stations,"Travelers have always been vulnerable. Centuries ago they were attacked by pirates, but nowadays most of the thefts happen on a digital level. In 2019, transport became the second priority for cybercriminals, right after financial organizations. USB chargers might be traveler-friendly and installed in public places for their convenience, but they're not necessarily safe.

IBM Security experts say that cybercriminals use USB ports in airports, train stations and other public places to steal personal data from your gadgets. They have no difficulty modifying USB ports by installing special software that steals the owner’s personal data, including bank information.

SUMMARY:
- When you plug the cable into a compromised outlet, you'll connect your smartphone or tablet to an external drive that launches the process of copying your data or installing a virus on it.
- This technology is known as juice jacking. Another way they use to steal your data is called video-jacking, which is also based on using a modified USB port. 
- Sometimes they don't even bother to do anything to the port itself, they just leave a cable plugged in there. 
- After smartphone producers learned about juice-jacking, they did add extra safety measures to their devices. Now iOS and Android ask for your approval to get connected to an external device. 
- There're other risks too. If you've got an Android with an older operating system, or the USB debugging mode is switched off, it’ll be no problem to pass a virus onto it. 
- There's a function on the latest Apple devices called USB Restricted Mode – it's an innovative defense mechanism, which prohibits data exchange during charging through a USB port. 
- If you’re using a device with the latest version of the operational system, in theory, there shouldn’t be much danger. But still, if you need to charge it urgently in a public place, don’t use a public USB port. 
- Bring a common charger and plug it in a common outlet. This is less convenient since there aren’t as many of them in airports, but it’s definitely safe. 
- Another option is to charge a power bank through a USB port and then charge your smartphone with it. 
- If that's still not enough, you could buy a special USB cable, which lets you charge the device, but doesn't allow the exchange of data.
- There's also a completely different kind of danger when it comes to charging your smartphone through a USB cable: the device can simply burn out from voltage swell. 
- Create 12-symbol passwords. It shouldn’t be your mother’s maiden name, the last 4 numbers of your passport number, your birthday or your address. 
- Don’t share the details of every single step you make on social media.  Remember that in doing so, you make it easier for actual thieves to trace your route and rob your house while you’re on a business trip or vacation.
- Don’t ever show your boarding pass on social media. At first glance, it looks like the only information you can get from it is a passenger name and the booking reference.
- If you still don't feel like the vacation has started until you take a traditional picture of your passport with a boarding pass, delete the ticket number, booking reference and any data about your flight from the picture before posting it.

Mental Health and Wellness for Students of Color: Transitioning to College,"Amid the bustle on U.S. college campuses, a growing challenge is causing concern. Many college students of color report mental health issues–including depression, anxiety and, among some groups, increased risk for suicide–that are not well understood or effectively addressed. According to surveys conducted by Harris Poll, students of color feel both more isolated and more overwhelmed than their white classmates. At the same time, they are less likely to seek counseling services on campus.

Bringing together experts with diverse experiences and perspectives, this Forum explored how colleges can better support the social, emotional and mental health needs of students of color, particularly during the critical transition to college. Panelists emphasized evidence-based steps and policies that can help cultivate a positive and healthy experience for college students of color.

This Forum event was presented in partnership with The Steve Fund and jointly with HuffPost on September 18, 2019.

Lyrics:
I've been havin dreams
Jumpin on a trampoline
Flippin in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I've been having dreams
Splashin in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Invasive species 'hitchhiking' on ships to Antarctica BBC News,"Species from around the world that are ""hitching a lift"" on ships threaten Antarctica's pristine marine ecosystem.

That is the conclusion of a study tracking research, fishing and tourist vessels that routinely visit the otherwise isolated region.

Any marine species that can cling to the hull of the ship and survive the journey to Antarctica could pose an invasive threat, including mussels, barnacles, crabs and algae.

What Would Happen If You Weight 1 Kg,"Imagine that you weigh just 1 pound. You'd feel very light, but life would become much harder. Tapping “likes” on photos would take much more than just tapping. You’ve been scrolling Instagram feed, but it feels like you’ve run 6 miles on a treadmill. 

You leave the apartment and take the stairs because the elevator simply won't work if you weigh less than 30 pounds. The weather outside better be warm and without strong wind. Otherwise, it may blow you away. And you better turn off vibration on your phone. With your mass, it will be tantamount to a minor earthquake.

SUMMARY:
- On average, a person eats 3.3 pounds of food per day, and about 60 tons of food in a lifetime. With your wee weight, don't rush to fill the fridge, because all you need to stay full all day is a glass of milk and a couple of corn flakes.
- However, if you do fall, you won’t be hurt, because due to the small weight, the pulling force will act differently on you. 
- At music concerts, you can easily reach the stage, running over the heads of other spectators.
- To type something on a computer keyboard, you’ll have to slam it with your fist, and to play the piano, you’ll have to walk on the keys.
- Even a slight pressure of water from the shower will stamp you to the bottom of the tub.
- What if we become even lighter? Say, 1 oz? You can forget about the stairs and the elevator. Go out the window, because if you fall from a height of even 10,000 feet, you will land unharmed.
- Moreover, your weight is just a little more than that of... the soul. Indeed, according to research by Dr. MacDougall, the weight of the human soul is 0.7 oz.
- Any insect is dangerous for you. And the flap of the butterfly wing will be equivalent to the wind from a powerful fan.
- Now imagine that if every person on Earth weighed 1 oz, then the weight of all of the people would be 198 thousand tons! It's like 4 ""Titanics"" or 100 Statues of Liberty!
- The weight of the lightest person on Earth was recorded in the 19th century in Mexico. Lucia Zarate's weight was only 4.6 pounds.
- And the heaviest person also happened to be a resident of Mexico – Juan Pedro Franco with a weight of 1,300 pounds.
- Did you notice that it is much easier to slim down in summer than in winter? This happens because the human body specifically stores as much fat as possible in order to survive the cold.
- Not only the level of physical activity and the number of calories consumed can change the mass of our body. Stress does a great job too. 
- In addition, excess pounds may appear because of a lack of sleep. If you don’t get enough shut-eye, the body doesn't generate energy and stresses out. 
- The mass of our body, in fact, determines the force with which we are attracted to the Earth. The larger the mass, the stronger the attraction. 
- You’ll be the lightest on Pluto — there your weight will only be 9 pounds. 
- But there are places in our galaxy where gravity is millions of times greater than on our planet. These places are called neutron stars.

The loved ones who disappear without a trace  - BBC News,"There are currently more than 130,000 people recorded as missing by police, according to new figures seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme. Most of those who disappear will return home quickly, normally within in a week, but a small proportion - around 1% - are still not found a year later. 
It is thought there are 15,000 families in the UK who are still trying to find their loved ones more than 12 months after they first vanished.  Jim Reed has been speaking to some of them.

"Combination Locks Are Completely Useless, Here's Why","Combination locks may seem secure, but they're not foolproof. Despite their popularity, they're vulnerable to a technique called ""lock manipulation,"" where skilled individuals can determine the combination without knowing it. This method relies on detecting slight changes in resistance as each dial is turned, eventually revealing the correct sequence. Plus, combination locks can be susceptible to brute force attacks, where all possible combinations are systematically tried until the lock opens. Find out more safety tips to make your house your fortress.

"Carbon and Earth’s future climate on This Week @NASA – November 13, 2015","New observations from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission is providing insight into how Earth is responding to rising levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, and what this means for our future climate. Earth’s land and ocean currently absorb about half of all carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, but it’s uncertain whether the planet can keep this up in the future. Later this month, a United Nations climate meeting in Paris will focus on setting limits on future levels of human-produced carbon emissions. OCO-2 is NASA’s first satellite dedicated to measuring carbon dioxide.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ium7ySM-M4
Israel and Palestinian tensions on the rise in the West Bank - BBC News,"Israel's military has been carrying out arrest raids in the occupied West Bank - a frequent event since a wave of deadly attacks by Palestinians against Israelis earlier this year.

Dozens of Palestinians, mainly militants, have been killed during army incursions, and the UN’s human rights office has raised concerns over “excessive force” and “possible collective punishment”. Israel has rejected such accusations.

In the city of Jenin, Palestinian militant groups have been rearming, raising fears of further violence.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

18 COOL AND EASY DIY WALL DECOR IDEAS TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIVING SPACE,"SHOP OUR MERCH HERE: https://teespring.com/stores/5minutecrafts


HOW TO PAINT THE WALLS

These DIY painting tips will help you roll your walls quickly and smoothly—without leaving roller marks. We'll show you the tricks and techniques that painting pros use to get a perfectly painted room. All you need are some basic tools to paint fast, get great results and make clean up a breeze. Painting is one of the least expensive ways to make over a room, so grab a roller and let's get to work.

Clean the walls.
Tape the trim.
Pour primer into a tray.
Roll the primer onto the wall. Tip: Follow the manufacturer's drying instructions, which you'll find on the can, to make sure the primer is completely dry before applying paint.
Paint the trim.
Roll on paint in a “w” shape.
Remove the painter's tape.

But these are just the basics, let's move on to creative stuff!

The first part is a pattern roller, which is a 6-inch wide rubber roller having a raised pattern embossed on its surface. The second part is an applicator which consists of a frame, a handle, and a special foam feeder roller.

To use it, you simply roll the feeder roller into some paint (any paint, no special glazes needed), snap on a pattern roller and you're ready to roll!

How the Tequila fish became 'un-extinct' - BBC News,"Conservationists in Mexico have brought a species of fish - that was previously declared extinct - back to the wild. 

""Missing"" since 2003, the Tequila fish is back in the rivers of south-west Mexico.

The reintroduction is being held up as an example of how freshwater ecosystems and species can be saved.

The eye of Typhoon Hagibis made landfall shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in Izu Peninsula, southwest of Tokyo.

More than seven million people have been urged to leave their homes amid severe flood and landslide warnings.

Train services have been halted, and more than a thousand flights grounded.

"Lucky Daye - ""Concentrate"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Lucky Daye - Concentrate (Official Performance - Vevo)

Good thing he's got perseverance. From Atlanta to New Orleans, Lucky Daye tested out his brand of vintage-tinged soul through cities in the South. But things didn't really click until he hit LA, went through a bleak period, and decided to give it one last try by connecting with producer  Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II. Bang. The creativity kicked in and the Daye's sound came together. Together they built seductive tracks like ""Late Night"" and ""Roll Some Mo,"" key tunes from Daye's debut EP, 'I.' Oddly enough, they have a way of echoing the past while nodding to the future - a clever move that's putting the singer's name on many critics' lips right now. We brought him to hit our DSCVR stage and had him roll through ""Concentrate"" and ""Roll Some Mo."" Both turned out great. Check 'em out and get ready to meet a new fave.

Lyrics:

All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
don't pay him any attention
Cause I cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY

10 Proven Tricks To Clean Your House Faster,"How much time do you spend cleaning your house? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average person spends nearly 2 hours a day doing household chores. When you consider the fact that you’ve got 24 hours in a day, 8 of which should be spent sleeping and another 8 at school or work, then it seems like we’re wasting a lot of time keeping our houses tidy. 

There’s nothing better than a spotless house. But, to tell the truth, for many of us cleaning our house is not on our list of our favorite ways to spend time. Bright Side likes when there’s no dust in the air but we don’t like to waste our weekends. That’s why we gathered some tricks on how to clean your house in just a few minutes.

TIMESTAMPS: 
Start with decluttering 1:11
Use a trash bag 1:54
Bring a cleaning carrier with you 2:42
Dust first, vacuum last 3:31
Plan your movements 4:01
Spray and let it sit 4:43
Don’t forget the baseboards 5:25
Vacuum upholstery 6:15
Use dish soap as glass cleaner 6:48
Clean appliances right after use 7:33
Bonus 8:27

#householdchores #tidyhouse #housecleaning

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- The best thing to do is to start by decluttering before you even think about scrubbing anything down. Go one room at a time and put away everything that doesn’t belong in a certain place.
- A trash bag will be your best friend when it comes to decluttering your entire home. Always carry one with you as you’re picking up in case you come across anything that you can throw away, whether it’s actual trash or not.
- Put all your cleaning items in a basket and carry it around with you in every room. This will save you the hassle of running to wherever you keep your cleaners each time you need one.
- Dirt and crumbs fall on the floor when you dust and clean all the surfaces. So it’s pretty useless to vacuum first because you’ll only add new dirt on the clean floor whenever you wipe everything down.
- Start by going into every single room in your house and moving from left to right. This way, you can clean your whole house thoroughly without missing any spots.
- When you walk into a room, start by spraying all the surfaces, moving from left to right. Go to the next room and repeat the same thing without wiping anything away.
- If your house is clean but your baseboards aren’t, then your home still looks dirty.
- Couches, armchairs, and mattresses can have more than 10,000 dust mites living on the surface. These dust mites feed off dead skin cells that are left on the area, and they’re constantly multiplying.
- Believe it or not, dish soap can leave sticky surfaces crystal clean, and it gets rid of scale build-up on bathroom windows and mirrors better than glass cleaner!
- Clean your stovetop, oven, toaster, and microwave after each time you use them.

Inside a dangerously divided 'city of snipers' - BBC News,"Taiz, in Yemen's south-west, is home to one of the longest-running battles of the country's civil war.

Known as the city of snipers, Taiz - divided between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the government - is constantly under siege.

Saudi air-strikes have continued since the start of the war in 2015 and the people of Taiz say they feel forgotten.

The BBC gained exclusive access to see what life is like for those living on the government controlled side of this divided city.

Sofia Camara - Who Do I Call Now? (Hellbent) (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Sofia Camara - Who Do I Call Now? (Hellbent) | An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

A relationship ruptures under a relentless flood of passion in Sofia Camara’s outstanding power ballad ""Who Do I Call Now? (Hellbent).” A lover has walked out the door. Tears have been shed. And although she’s surrounded by broken dishes and glasses, the narrator would trade silence and loneliness for their (seemingly toxic) partner to come back. Only 22-years-old, it’s impressive that the Toronto-raised, Portugal-born newcomer weaves the contradictions of the soul into her music with such deft touch. During breaks between DSCVR performances, she described her bond with music as “a healing thing,” and how she wants the relationship with her songs and their listeners to be a two-way street; ""I hope it heals a part of them the way it kind of healed a part of me,"" she offers. With more than 10 million Spotify streams, Camara’s foundational track has certainly mended the hearts of many. That her musical spark came from a school project on Adele makes even more sense when you spin through “Do You Love Me” and “Never Be Yours.” The first simmers in a downtempo pop broth, the second rocks n’ rolls a bit. Both are a one way trip to an emotional coliseum, where love, resentment and longing battle it out. This earnest vigor is rare, and we expect to see the powerhouse vocalist tearing up stages for quite a long time - starting right here.

26 CHEAT PHOTO TRICKS YOU SHOULD TRY FOR FUN || INSTAGRAM HACKS,"A CHEATSHEET FOR ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PHOTOGRAPHERS – INFLUENCER LIFE

In this video, I show you some amazing ideas to turn you into a social media influencer. I show you how to make your pictures more professionally and how to make your posts viral using my photography tricks. 
For starters, you can wear some headphones, place a plastic chair on top of you, snap a close-up photo of yourself and make it look like you’re flying a helicopter. 
To improve the way your profile looks, you can sit in front of a black background, use black paint and paint your nose and chin to make them look smaller. 
You can place a model toy car in your driveway and take closeup photos of it. People on your feed will think that this is a life-scale race car. 
You can also try your photography and filter skills using different materials. You can use a torch in front of a CD to make it reflect the rainbow on the object you’re photographing. 
Though I also show you the fake side of social media and how manipulated we can be by a photo. Not everything we see online is real, and almost no-one is as happy as they appear to be. Watch until the end to see my expectations vs reality clips and some ideas on how to pose for photos.

Daniel Kahneman is winner of the Nobel Prize in economics for his integration of economic science with the psychology of human behavior, judgment and decision-making. He is the author of the popular book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" that summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ""System 1"" is fast, instinctive and emotional; ""System 2"" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking.

Iraq: Five Years After the Battle of Mosul,"It's been five years since the battle to retake the city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from the Islamic State group (ISg) was officially declared “over” on July 10, 2017.

22 CEMENT AND CLAY DIY IDEAS,"COOL CRAFTS FROM CEMENT

We love making crafts from different materials. Today you will find a collection of ideas from polymet clay and concrete. Sometimes, cement and concrete are overlooked as people think that these materials are hard to use. Believe or not, but cement and concrete are one of the best materials for crafting. And both materials are quite simple to use. You can make a whole collection of decorative items like vases, planters and even furniture. Let’s make together a trivet for your kettle using silicone mold, drinking straws, and cement. Watch our full tutorial in this video. Do you need to buy a stool? You can make it at home and this project is pretty easy. You will need a bucket, three wooden legs, concrete and sticky tape. Mix cement according to the instruction on the package in the bucket. Once the concrete is settled, place legs inside and secure them using sticky tape. Wait till the concrete has fully hardened take the stool out of a bucket. Now you have a perfect stool, also, you can paint it in any color you like. 
You can make small concrete letters for a Birthday or big concrete letters to decorate home or office. You will need cardboard to make a mold and wrap them in a few layers of tape to avoid a leak. Pour concrete mix inside the letters and let dry. Remove the cardboard and enjoy! You can also use concrete letters as bookends.
One more cool material to create is polymer clay. You can create different handmade accessories like cute bowls for jewelry, a holder for pencils, a dish for a soap bar.

UK extends emergency Covid powers  despite opposition from some members of parliament - BBC News,"MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in England until September despite a big rebellion by backbench Conservative MPs against the plan. 

The government has refused to rule out extending the wide-ranging powers again in October. The health secretary Matt Hancock told the commons he expected people would continue to wear masks long after restrictions are lifted and warned cases could rise again. 

Plans for so-called vaccine passports were raised by the prime minister, to allow people back into pubs and other hospitality and entertainment venues. 

Boris Johnson said the idea might only be viable once everybody in the UK had been offered a vaccine.  

Meanwhile European leaders have been meeting to discuss tightening export controls on vaccines as Europe faces a third wave of the pandemic. 

Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Europe editor Katya Adler.

Lyrics:
I was driving with the windows down  
Music loud, lost as anyone could be 
Praying that an open road 
Would heal my soul and fill the emptiness in me 
 
I wasn’t in a church  
I wasn’t on my knees in prayer 
But I know I heard Your voice  
Right then, right there 
 
I met You on a highway 
Tears were in my eyes 
The dashboard was the altar 
Where I gave You my life 
Oh, the headlights were shining 
There were angels all around 
Oh, it still feels like holy ground 
When I go driving with the windows down 
  
Now every single mile I drive 
Testifies how You turned my life around  
‘Cause I remember when I called Your name 
Everything changed 
I was lost but now I’m found 
  
I met You on a highway 
Tears were in my eyes 
The dashboard was the altar 
Where I gave You my life 
Oh, the headlights were shining 
There were angels all around 
Oh, it still feels like holy ground 
When I go driving with the windows down 
 
Every time  
I turn the key 
Sweet salvation  
Is falling down on me 
  
Driving with the windows down 
  
Oh, I met you on a highway 
Tears were in my eyes 
And the dashboard was the altar 
Where I gave you my life 
Oh, the headlights were shining 
There were angels all around 
Oh, it still feels like holy ground 
Yes, it does 
Oh, it still feels like holy ground 
When I go driving with the windows down 
I still go driving with the windows down

"Taliban ""shooting protesters"" as thousands try to flee Afghanistan - BBC News","Taliban fighters are reported to have opened fire on crowds and shot dead protesters in Afghanistan who were demonstrating against their takeover of the country. 

There have been more desperate scenes outside the international airport in Kabul, as thousands of Afghans try to flee the country.

In response to the developing humanitarian crisis the UK announced that it will take 20,000 Afghan refugees over a number of years. But the British government is facing fierce criticism from many UK MPs over the withdrawal of western troops that led to the Taliban's seizure of power.  

Many of those Afghans who want to leave  worked alongside coalition forces and diplomatic staff in the 20 years since the invasion following the 9/11 terror attacks.

Can a photograph define a crisis? BBC News,"The picture of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying face-down on a Turkish beach has provoked furious debate about what the UK and EU are doing to stem the worst refugee crisis since World War II. Can a photograph define a moment in a crisis and do images still have the impact to change people’s minds? Nick Ut's picture of nine-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc - a young girl, running naked and terrified down the road after a napalm attack - became one of the iconic images of the Vietnam War. ""This child could be any of ours - he's wearing fashionable clothes and is wearing trainers - and has obviously died on his own,"" said Brett Rogers, director of London’s Photographer’s Gallery.

"Unqualified Botox, filler and laser 'doctors' endangering lives in Egypt – BBC News","Serious flaws in the Egyptian beauty industry that are endangering lives and leaving people scarred for life have been exposed in a BBC News investigation.

In Egypt, people must be a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to inject Botox or dermal fillers. 

Even laser hair removal requires a qualified doctor’s supervision.

But dozens of unqualified people are working in the beauty industry, in breach of Egyptian laws and regulations.

Stating that they were overwhelmed by the fast pace of growth in the sector, the body responsible for registering doctors in Egypt, the Doctors’ Syndicate, said they need more power to take action. 

The Egyptian Health Ministry has not responded to a request to comment.

Australian Islanders in landmark climate fight - BBC News,"A group of indigenous islanders from Australia’s Torres Strait have launched a world-first legal battle in a bid to protect their homes.

They argue Australia has breached their rights to culture and life by failing to adequately address climate change.

The low-lying islands, located on the northern tip of the country, have seen rising sea levels, coastal erosion and flooding in recent years.

It’s the first time a claim of this kind has been taken to the UN Human Rights Committee.

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Islamophobic abuse and social media - BBC News,"Almost 7,000 Islamophobic tweets were sent, in English, every day last month. In April it was an average of two and a half thousand a day. July saw the most anti-islamic abuse on the site for five months as Europe was hit by the Nice terror attack and the murder of a Priest. Researchers at the think-tank Demos collected the data and with police predicting a terror attack for the UK they say this kind of abuse is likely to escalate. Catrin Nye has this exclusive report - which contains some very strong language.

LYRICS: 
Last night put the heavy on me 
Woke up, and I’m feeling lonely 
This world gotta a way of showin’ me 
Some days it’ll lift you up 
Some days it’ll call your bluff 
Man, most of my days I ain’t got enough 

And all I know is You’re my only hope 

When I’m up, when I’m down 
When the wolves come around 
When my feet hit the ground 
I just need, I just need U 
On my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
No, it ain’t gonna change 
I just need, I just need U 
Lord, I need U 
Yeah, I just need U 

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil for thou art with me 
Thy rod and thy staff … 
They comfort me when I’m beat down broken 
Hold my heart when it’s split wide-open 
Turn these eyes to my sole protector 
And break the will of this born defector 

When You pull me closer I come to life 

Ain’t no way this thing gon’ change, it’s U 
I need on my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
I need U every single day, every breath I take 
I need U

Lyrics: 
Livin for me, talkin for You
Too much for me, nothin for You
Foolin myself but not foolin You
Never gonna make it if I push You Away
Risin up from deep inside of me 
Seein there’s a better side of me
Calling out for You is all I need 

Unqualified and a hypocrite
Full of scars that I aint dealing with
I’m writing songs for the world to sing 
But I’m still the one who’s not listening
But there’s something bout this love
I didn’t know when I said to God
To send me He really would 
Cause I’m really not that good
But I heard everybody rather pretend
Is anybody really happy let me see them
Only wanna talk to God on the weekend
When you get a little older then you’ll need him
But you know that you feel like something’s missing
An things don’t make the difference
We need a savior not religion
So God sent his son to get us

This the life that I miss
How did I get too busy for Ya
Sometimes I make it too complex

Sometimes I need to talk to God
Right now
Sometimes I need to talk to God
Right now
Sometimes I need to talk to God

Woke up this morning
Did a lil self-help, looking into therapy
Hit a podcast and I watched me some Gary Vee
Yeah I work hard I don’t need me no charity

Tryin stay on track 
Thought life on Mortal Kombat
“Woosah”, deep breath, calm app, either that or what’s on tap

Got a whole lot on my shoulders
Tryin find someone to hold it
Whiteboard gotta stay focused 
“Namaste” with the yoga

After all my hard work, all my planning, all my thoughts
How I still feel lost?
Well 
Sometimes I need to talk to God""",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x4BjQ-pzZ0

FLO - Immature (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"FLO - Immature (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

It’s time to bring back the girl groups, ya’ll. Especially the UK ones. Certainly the spirit of Spice Girls and Sugababes was alive in Renée Downer, Jorja Douglas, and Stella Quaresma when they formed FLO. Considering the impact of the trio’s “Cardboard Box,"" it seems fans were ready for the girl group sound, too. One of the FLO's strengths is their chemistry, which comes from familiarity. Renée and Stella are childhood friends, and Jorja says she keyed into their vibe immediately. “I knew from the moment [we met] we were about to start something big.” The R&B trio took two years honing their craft before dropping any tracks. That timespan included finding the right producers, such as MNEK, who has credits with Dua Lipa and Beyoncé, and produced “Cardboard Box.” Thanks to deep catchiness and fantastic choreography, snippets of their debut video seem to go viral every other week on Twitter and TikTok - no wonder it has more than three million views on YouTube. Considering this is still FLO's early stages, these DSCVR versions of “Cardboard Box” and “Immature” are sure to get gobbled up by fans. Get back on the girl group bandwagon while there’s room.

You'll Never Throw Away Banana Peels After Watching This,"I bet you never thought that banana peels could be good for anything other than slapstick comedy gags. You won't throw away banana peels anymore – you can use it in so many different ways!

The most common thing to do with banana peels is to throw them in the trash. However, there are various miraculous uses for this frequently-overlooked product. The peels can be used in your kitchen as a cleaning product or in your beauty routine.

TIMESTAMPS
Banana peels for your garden 0:43
Banana peel spray 1:09
Banana peel vinegar 1:34
Get rid of acne 2:11
Banana peel face mask 2:50
Whiten your teeth 3:17

SUMMARY
- Banana peels contain vitamin C and vitamin E and they also contain potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese. These nutrients can calm inflamed skin and reduce acne outbreaks. 
- Facial wrinkles occur when the skin loses its elasticity and it loses its firmness. The antioxidants and vitamin C in bananas can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
- When your silver begins to lose its luster or it begins to tarnish, try using a banana peel. The inside of a banana peel contains substances such as potassium that help clean metal objects.
- A banana peel is rich in enzymes and these enzymes in the banana skin have a pulling action that will draw the foreign subject to the surface of the skin which will make it much easier to grab the splinter or sliver or glass with a pair of tweezers.
- Adding a banana peel to your compost pile will help introduce more calcium, magnesium, sulfur, phosphates, potassium, and sodium — all of which are vital to the healthy growth of your plants.
- Ripe banana peels are very rich in potassium that can help reduce yellow stains that appear as a result of the consumption of certain beverages such as coffee and tea and certain foods such as blueberries and raspberries.
- Banana peels have the ability to drastically reduce skin irritation such as swelling, redness, and scarring. 
- If you are looking for a natural way to treat your migraine, look no further than your fruit basket. A banana peel across the forehead and across the back of the neck can help relieve headaches! 
- To keep your steak moist and tender, add some ripe banana skin to the roasting pan. This way, you will ensure that your roast stays juicy while it’s in the oven and that it stays full of flavor.
- Banana peels are a great home remedy for itchy skin. Banana peels contain histamine, lowering nutrients such as magnesium, vitamin C, and vitamin E.

Education suffers in Kashmir's 'endless' lockdown,"Students in Indian-administered Kashmir have missed most of their school year due to the fact that the troubled region has been almost in endless lockdown.

First, a lockdown was imposed following the decision to revoke the region's special status. And then, the Covid-19 pandemic has shut schools again. Slow internet speeds mean that online classes are not viable as either a teaching tool or a learning one.

So some people are trying to change that by conducting schools for students in the open.

La Plazuela - El Lao De La Pena (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"La Plazuela - El Lao De La Pena. Una sesión exclusiva para Vevo DSCVR, el canal donde encontrarás la mejor música emergente.

Los músicos granadinos Manuel Hidalgo Sierra (El Indio) y Luis Abril Martín (El Nitro) se conocen desde siempre, pero no fue hasta la secundaria cuando se juntaron por primera vez para hacer versiones de canciones de sus músicos favoritos –Camarón, Los Chichos, Manzanita, Pata Negra. ""Siempre éramos los dos que estábamos hablando de música y fantaseando con tener una banda”, dice Manuel a El Periódico de España. El sueño se materializó bastante rápido y de ahí nació La Plazuela quienes, con su mezcla de flamenco, neo funk, pop, sintetizadores y música electrónica, se han convertido en referentes de la nueva escena musical en Granada. El dúo lanzó su primer EP ‘Yunque, Clavos y Arcayatas’ en el 2019 a un público más que receptivo al son de La Plazuela. Tanto fue el éxito que los llevó a trabajar con los productores Antonio Narváez de Dellafuente y Lorenzo Cavanillas de Califato ¾ para el EP ‘Jamila’ y a lanzar su primer álbum ‘RONEO FUNK CLUB’. Sin pena, La Plazuela no titubea en decir que su música es así por sus influencias, sus vivencias y su amor eterno por los recovecos, las plazas frías y el calor inigualable de Granada. “Muchas veces en nuestra música usamos referencias y nos parece que hablar de ello es importante, por defenderlo y rendirle homenaje"", explica Luis al diario El Mundo. La Plazuela tomó el control del escenario DSCVR para cantar “La Primera Helá” y “El Lao de la Pena” en vivo desde el estudio de Vevo en Londres. 

Granada, Andalucía natives Manuel Hidalgo Sierra (El Indio) and Luis Abril Martín (El Nitro) have known each other forever. In high school, they formed a cover band, playing music from their favorite musicians – Camarón, Los Chichos, Manzanita, Pata Negra, to name a few. “We were always the two kids talking about music and fantasizing about starting a band,” Manuel says. That dream materialized rather quickly when La Plazuela was born. These days, the band has become a torchbearer for the new Granada music scene with an eclectic fusion of flamenco, neo funk, pop, synths and EDM. The duo released its first EP ‘Yunque, Clavos y Arcayatas’ in 2019 to an audience hungry for La Plazuela’s unique sound. Success was swift and paved the way for the artists to work with renowned producers Antonio Narváez from Dellafuente and Lorenzo Cavanillas from Califato ¾ on the next EP, ‘Jamila.’ Now, with their first album, ‘RONEO FUNK CLUB’, La Plazuela doesn’t hesitate to show listeners that their music is a collective cultural effort, one that showcases their eternal love for the alleyways, plazas and human warmth of Granada. “We defend it and we honor it,” Luis said about their the impetus behind their new tracks, which include “La Primera Helá” and “El Lao de la Pena.” Time to go to Andalusia.

The largest coronavirus outbreak outside China is on a cruise ship  - BBC News,"The largest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China is not in a country, but on a cruise ship.

It's been more than a week since the Diamond Princess went into lockdown, after a previous passenger tested positive for the virus after disembarking.

With almost 500 out of 3,700 people on board tested, 174 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Those still on board are in quarantine for another week.

But it's not just the Diamond Princess.

On another cruise ship in Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers people were quarantined because of fears that people on board might have the virus.

They were only allowed to disembark after tests came back negative.

And a cruise ship carrying more than 1,450 passengers, which left Hong Kong on 1 February, was turned away from ports in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, despite having no infections on board. It has now been told it can dock in Cambodia.

Cruise ships have for years been referred to as ""floating Petri dishes"" - places ripe for the exchange of germs, and the spreading of illness. #BBCOS #BBCOutsideSource",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-wXsVC9RWc

Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da

"Put Aspirin Into the Washing Machine, and See What Happens","According to the American Time Use Survey by the U.S. Department of Labor, women spend an average of 17 minutes a day on doing laundry. In case you’re looking for smart tips on how to make your clothes white and soft nearly for free – these life hacks are just for you. You can use some simple things you have at home in the washing machine to get even the most stubborn stains out easily and make your clothes dry faster. 


Aspirin gets deep into the fabric of stained clothes and effectively removes dirt. It's especially good for shirts with sweat stains since aspirin easily breaks up and lifts that frustrating yellowish tint. If you dissolve aspirin in cold water, it’ll help you get rid of blood stains on your clothes! It’s really important that the water be cold because hot water will only fix the proteins in the blood deep into the fabric.
Experienced laundry “gurus” don't recommend adding liquid fabric softener when washing your whites. And that’s because it doesn't let your clothes become as white as possible. Don't sort your clothes by their color, sort them by the density of the fabric. Heavy fabrics absorb more water than lighter ones, which is why the detergent gets washed out of different items in varying degrees.
Scientists have actually come up with something called the “Sock Loss Index”! Psychologist Simon Moore and statistician Geoff Ellis teamed up to develop a formula explaining where our lost socks go. Turns out, careless sock pairing and putting socks in the wrong wash are the biggest causers of the lost-sock mystery.

TIMESTAMPS
Throw some aspirin into the washer to whiten your clothes. 0:40
Don't use liquid fabric softener on your whites. 2:59
Use mouthwash to clean the washing machine. 3:24
Use baby shampoo to restore shrunken clothes. 3:51
Don't sort your loads by color. 4:50
Use shaving cream to get makeup stains out. 5:32
Remove stubborn stains with a hairdryer. 5:40
Use towels to make your laundry dry faster. 6:03
Use special bags when washing socks. 6:24
Don't dry your clothes too much. 7:06

SUMMARY
-Putting some aspirin into the washing machine can help whiten and brighten your whites. And this effect is all thanks to the salicylic acid contained in these pills.
-If your goal is blindingly white whites, then all you need to use is bleach. Skip on the detergent and liquid fabric softener.
-Add half a cup of mouthwash to your detergent tray, run a full wash cycle, and that’s it. You’ve effectively destroyed fungus, mold, and harmful bacteria.
-Using baby shampoo you’ll ""relax"" the fibers in the garment. And this will make it possible to stretch the fabric back to its original shape and size.
-Don't sort your clothes by their color, sort them by the density of the fabric. Mixing your fabrics damages clothes with thin fibers.
-To remove makeup from your clothes, you can put regular ol’ shaving cream on the stain and just wash the items as you normally would. 
-You can actually get rid of old non-protein stains, such as those from grass, soil, or juice (but not blood), by heating them up with a hairdryer and then putting a little detergent on the spot.
-If you don’t have time to wait for your dryer to finish a load, just throw a dry towel into the machine. The towel will absorb the moisture in the clothes, cutting drying time way down.
-To avoid losing or mixing socks and undies, it’s a good idea to use special bags to wash small pieces of clothing for each member of the family.
-It's easier to iron clothes that are still a little damp. It's even possible to iron clothes (especially dress shirts and other items made from thin fabric) straight out of the washer.

Lyrics

I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind, cause

I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love, cause

I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
Cause all I do is cry behind this smile

I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50VWOBi0VFs

Speaking at a summit in Brussels, she said there was still ""work to do"" but there had been progress and talks over ""further clarification"" would continue.

LYRICS
Don't you remember the nights in December
the booze and the mates and the Fenders 
Of the band you thought were sick 
Don't you remember the way that girl looked at you 
How you held her hair while she puked in the loo 
And still kissed her anyway 

So tell me one more time 
That I've been trashing your bedtime 
I hear you knock knock knock on the door 
And you let me know 
Pipe down or you'll have to go! 

Baby don't tell me you're too old to
Have a little bit of fun sometimes 
Songs loud and dance a while 

Baby don't tell me you don't get why I 
Need my friends need a bottle and a guy 
Forget the day I love the night 
Sorry Mr 10pm bedtime 

Don't you remember the lines and the beer cans 
the shouts and the screams and the naughty hands 
In your mates rents bedroom 
Don't you remember not washing for a week or two 
the neighbours that said that they hated you 
Coz newsflash, that's you 

Don't tell me one more time
How I've been trashing your bedtime 
I hear you knock knock knock on the door 
And you let me know 
Pipe down or you'll have to go! 


Baby don't tell me you're too old to
Have a little bit of fun sometimes 
Songs loud and dance a while 

Baby don't tell me you don't get why I 
Need my friends need a bottle and a guy 
Forget the day I love the night 
Sorry Mr 10pm bedtime 

It's bedtime on your floor
Turn off the lights but your eyes want more
Not bedtime on our floor 
We making noise and ya mind wonders 
You think 
You're a bore we're a chore 
Do you never miss passing out on ya floor?
Mister, do you wanna talk?
Something tells me you don't want this anymore

So tell me one more time 
How I've been trashing your bedtime 
I hear you knock knock knock on the door 
And you let me know 
Pipe down or you'll have to go!

The Artemis I rocket and spacecraft are now combined and undergoing final testing at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where it will soon launch on the first in a series of increasingly ambitious missions.

What, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
Wh-uh-what, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
What, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
Wh-uh-what, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what

Atención, atención, que la clase está en sesión
Dios bendiga hip-hop
Dios bendiga reggaeton
Por aquí, por allá, yo camino en bendición
Porque tengo una mamá que me cubre en oración
Lejos de la religión pero mantengo mi fe
Porque sé que todo es posible para aquel que cree
Creo que Dios me dio el talento antes de nacer
Por eso nadie tiene flow como R-G

You’da thought you watching TV, way I tell a vision
This my walk, man, you don’t see these type of clever writtens
Started making my decisions off of my convictions
Pray to God that when they see me, they could tell the difference
I’m not a rapper trying to brag about the things that I own
I’d rather put you onto God, I’m looking out for your soul
God only knows, dawg, I’m barely afloat
My heart was stone, what’s a flooded out wrist in eternity’s scope?

Tanta letra mi libreta, we don’t gotta take a break
Esto es para Zacatecas, Zimapán y Monterrey
I’m a product of Lecrae, Ye, Lupe, and André
So next time you mention the greats, don’t forget the name

What, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
Wh-uh-what, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
What, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what
Wh-uh-what, wh-uh-what, what, wh-uh-what, what

Dímelo, bro. Bendiciones, papito. Espero que estés bien. Zumba. Zumba eso para acá. Seguro, estamos acá pendiente. Podemos hacer algo grande, brother. Así que nada, cuenta conmigo y pa’ adelante, papito. Bendiciones.

Brexit vote countdown - BBC News,"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is on a knife-edge, with the numbers too close to call ahead of a crucial vote in the House of Commons. He needs 320 votes to get it passed - but has only 287 Conservative MPs. It means he must persuade some Labour rebels, ex-Tories, and sceptics in his own party to support him.  
Tonight’s main report is from the BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar analyses the numbers and Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth canvasses the views of people in the Peak District. From Washington, Economics Editor Faisal Islam hears the assessment of Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney.

Transgender swimmers banned from elite women’s races - BBC News,"World swimming’s governing body has effectively banned transgender athletes from competing in women’s elite races.

FINA voted to stop any person who has transitioned from competing in the events, if they have been through any stage of male puberty.  

They are aiming to establish a new “open” category of competition for swimmers whose gender identity is different from their biological sex.

The new policy, which was passed with 71% of the vote of FINA members, was described as ""only a first step towards full inclusion"" for transgender athletes.

The former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, said she was ""really proud of FINA"".

However Athlete Ally, an LGBT advocacy group, called the new policy ""discriminatory and harmful”. 

Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by sports correspondent Jane Dougall.

3-Day Engine Overhaul - Roadkill Garage Pilot,"New Show, Roadkill Garage! 3-Day Engine Overhaul
This is the pilot episode of an all-new show that will be appearing exclusively on MotorTrendOnDemand.com monthly in 2016. This episode is here on YouTube to give you a taste of Roadkill Garage so you can decide if you'd like to subscribe to MotorTrendOnDemand.com to watch it (and a whole bunch of other gearhead content). You can follow Facebook.com/RoadkillShow for updates and behind-the-scenes info.

Roadkill Garage features David Freiburger from Roadkill and Steve Dulcich from Engine Masters (but, don't worry, Mike Finnegan is still the co-host on Roadkill). RK Garage will show Freiburger and Dulcich wrenching on Roadkill project cars and other things that meet the Roadkill vibe. They'll show you how to do the wrong things the right way.

In this episode, the guys attempt a three-day overhaul of the 351 Cleveland engine from the '67 Mercury Cougar that belonged to Freiburger when the show began, but that transferred to Dulcich before the shoot was over. The ""rebuild"" is not exactly kosher, but it's dirt cheap and generates good tire smoke!",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55TY4fuJCTA

The jar ovens are heated with charcoal on the bottom and all the pork belly and chicken hangs on the sides. The crispy pork belly is insanely tasty, and so crispy. The cooking method allows the meat to cook from the inside out and the skin to fully crispify. Amazing place, highly recommended when you’re in Chiang Mai.

Nam Ngiaw Loong Pong น้ำเงี้ยวลุงพงษ์ (https://goo.gl/maps/f7hKxi57Lv8UWhgU6) - Price - 40 THB - Easily one of the most popular and local comfort foods of northern Thailand is nam ngiaw (น้ำเงี้ยว), a porky tomato stew that’s eaten with soft rice noodles. Uncle Pong cooks one pot a day and when it’s gone it’s gone. It’s a traditional taste and a very friendly place.

O-Rote Ded โอรสเด็ด (https://goo.gl/maps/bLAKk6VoWFFxP2Wg7) - Next up on this Thai street food tour we’re going to O-Rote Ded โอรสเด็ด, which is famous for their Thai rice and curry. Everything is ready, you just go up to the front choose what looks good and try it. Make sure you arrive sometime in the morning 8 - 9 am is good to get the best selection.

Black Car Coffee (https://goo.gl/maps/8UoXxH8DcHxsHxfr7) - Right across the street, you’ll find P’Anchan who sells amazing coffee out of his old car.

Rotee Pa Day (โรตีป้าเด) - https://goo.gl/maps/aiDziA51xgUbABKWA - Finally to complete this amazing Thai street food tour in Chiang Mai, we’re going to Rotee Pa Day (โรตีป้าเด), where Aunty Day has been making roti for over 39 years - she’s a legend! One of the things she does differently is use only coconut oil for frying her roti which makes a huge difference. You can taste the cleanness of it. She’s also been recognized in the Thailand Michelin guide.

Thank you for watching and hope you have a great time eating Thai food when you’re in Chiang Mai!

(EXCLUSIVE) Inside Colombia's cocaine war - BBC News,"British anti-narcotics officers have spoken openly for the first time about their mission in Colombia. Until now little was known about their work in the country. But speaking exclusively to the BBC, the National Crime Agency, often dubbed Britain's FBI, has revealed it is involved in intelligence and logistical operations, working closely with Colombian forces. Despite a recent rise in the production of cocaine, British officers insist they are making a difference in the so-called war on drugs. Our International Correspondent, Ian Pannell and cameraman Darren Conway were given exclusive access to officers working in Colombia.

21 SATISFYING SOAP HACKS AND DIYs,"MAGIC OF SOAP MAKING
Soap making could be a real art! You can make different shapes, choose any color you like. Moreover, you can make a lot of different kinds of soap and give them to all your friends and family! And now you don’t need to think about gifts for Birthday or Christmas. Everybody loves handmade presents made from the heart. Soap base is sold in any craft shop and soap making won’t take a lot of time and money. You can create a lot of cute things using our tutorials. 
Check out the tutorial on how to make cute crystal soap. Crystal soaps are a big hit as they can add a beautiful detail to your bathroom. Cut the soap base and put into a bowl to melt in the microwave. Remember that overheating the base may cause your soaps to be brittle. Pour the melted base into the cardboard cups and let cool. Carve the tip of each rectangle into a crystal shape. The only thing you will need is a gift box for your perfect crystals. Voila!
Be crafty and create the handmade soap that will cost you a penny but you gonna enjoy the process and the result! Reuse old toys that you wanted to throw away. You can put a little toy in a shape and pour some molten transparent soap over it. The trick is the following: the more often the soap is used, the sooner the kids would get the toy! Isn't it the best motivation that can transform into a good habit?
Another cool idea is making soap roses! Want to learn how to make them? It's actually easier than it sounds. Watch this video and see how to make soap roses.
Moreover, you will find in our video is homemade natural soap for sensitive skin!
Many people have sensitive skin and prefer natural soap to soap that is sold in a supermarket. Using such organic ingredients as coconut oil, cocoa butter, honey you may prepare the cure for your dry skin. Unfortunately, many people wait until their skin becomes dry and sensitive to switch to natural soap. As a funny bonus, we share the recipe of colorful jelly soap that will amuse your family.😊

"Oasis tickets 'must not mislead' fans', says the UK Advertising Standards Authority | BBC News","Earlier this week standing price tickets for Cardiff, London and Edinburgh were advertised as £135 plus fees. But angry fans said online they noted ""in demand"" pricing on Ticketmaster had increased prices to £355 plus fees.

Ticketmaster say they do not set ticket prices.

A link on its website states: ""Promoters and artists set ticket prices. Prices can be either fixed or market-based. Market-based tickets are labelled as 'Platinum' or 'In Demand'.""

Ticketmaster confirmed that fans don't get anything else for the price increase.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told the BBC it could not pass comment on Ticketmaster's pricing in this instance.

“We encourage anyone with concerns to get in touch with us and we’d carefully assess whether there were any grounds for action,” an ASA spokesperson said.

But they added: “Our rules (the Advertising Codes) are clear – quoted prices must not mislead.”

Healer
It’s hard to see the storm blowing over any time soon
It’s hard to hear any hope in the headlines 
Or how to know what’s true
We’ve been trusting in the broken to make us whole
But there’s no new rescue coming 
It’s still the one we’ve always known 

We need the Healer
We don’t need another hero
We need the Healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the Healer 
And only Jesus is the Healer

The whole world’s looking for something
But what we need is someone 
And every road leads back to one name 
When all the searching is done
Cause there’s no world view, no religion
That can make the blind eyes see
Let the eyes of our heart be opened 
To the healing that we need 

We need the Healer
We don’t need another hero
We need the Healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the Healer 
And only Jesus is the Healer

More than comfort we need the King 
More than gifts we need the Giver
More than blessings we need Your Presence 
More than the healing we need the Healer 

We need the Healer
We don’t need another hero
We need the Healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the Healer 
Cause only Jesus is the Healer
Yes we need the, yes we need the Healer
No other name but Jesus is the Healer
Come now Jesus be the Healer

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Brazil's Amazon: Fireman 'saving what's not burnt' - BBC News,"Brazil's Amazon is experiencing another year of forest fires. It’s not just the Amazon that’s gone up in flames – the world’s biggest wetlands, the Pantanal, home to rare species like the jaguar, has seen its worst fires in more than two decades.

The fires are linked to growing deforestation - trees are felled and then the land is burned as a cheap and easy way to clear the area for agricultural use. The state of Para is the worst-affected area when it comes to deforestation

The Brazilian government this year brought in some early measures to curb the number of fires. It imposed a 120-day ban on fires and deployed the army to badly-hit areas. But, at the same time, President Bolsonaro has declared the fires a lie. His vice-president also told the BBC that the forest was not burning.

South America correspondent Katy Watson accompanied Corporal Carlos Rodrigues of Pará State Fire Department as he rushed to put out blazes.

"Omar Apollo - ""Hearing Your Voice"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Omar Apollo - Hearing Your Voice (Vevo DSCVR)

A Mexican-American singer whose Midwest roots help define him, Omar Apollo is ready to grab the spotlight with moody R&B grooves. Omar’s dad stuck a guitar in his son’s hand early on, and his uncle taught him chords, but his parents were still surprised their son chose music over college. Fans weren't, though. Give a listen to ""Ashamed"" or Trouble"" to see how he brings old school grit to a very catchy modern R&B sound. Omar’s nickname for a recent tour was W.A.N.T. (“We Are Niños Tímidos”), but one glance of his squad in action on our DSCVR clips of ""Kickback"" or ""Hearing Your Voice"" reveals that they’re always ready to kick up some dust.

Rat-infested home: 'I'm afraid for my child' - BBC News,"1 in 9 privately-rented homes in England has problems with rats, mice or cockroaches - according to housing charity Shelter. They asked 3,700 tenants about their living conditions and almost half said they had endured mould, damp or electrical hazards in the past year. Shelter wants the government to do more to protect renters from rogue landlords. Anna Adams went to north east London to visit Ruth Edmans who said she had problems with rats, dangerous sockets and other issues. Her landlord told us he had been unable to carry out work while tenants were there and he was working with the council to start remedial works.

20 TIPS FOR ANYONE WHO SUCK AT DIY,"IF YOU SUCK AT DIY, TRY THESE

Are you one of those people who thinks it's impossible to make something beautiful and useful with your own hands? Well, I'm gonna prove you wrong this time.

Let's take this pretty Celtic knot bracelets to begin with. You simply need to take two medium-sized ropes of different bright colors, combine them in a special manner and your Celtic knot is ready! Now you just can adjust the ropes edges with cute metallic locks and your bracelets are ready to wear!

Now go grab a couple of your boring old T-shirts and pair of scissors, chop-chop! Let's cut the T-shirt into same-length and width straps, tie these straps down in certain spots and here are amazing hanging plant pot holders for your favorite home plants and flowers!

Now let's take two pairs of old tights and fill them with rubber foam or cotton wool, tie this all in a beautiful knot and there you have it, beautiful and comfortable pillow!

You can make the same knot-tie procedure with any other objects like ropes for instance!

You can also create stylish belt for your jeans. Just take some ropes, tie them in the right way and your new accessory is ready to use!

Check out these amazing crayon ideas to boost your creativity and imagination!This time I'll show you some pretty awesome ways to recycle old broken crayons into something truly beautiful. You can make super cute colorful candles, paintings, animal-shaped or Lego-shaped chalks, wonderful pendants and cool prints for your T-shirts using parchment!

There's just too many genius ideas you can make with simple stones and pebbles! 
You can create amazing pebble mat to relax your feet, make adorable decoration for planters, you can even make crosses and noughts game and dominoes, plus you can add some nail polish to make it even better! 
Let's get creative! :)

Take several stones and put them in the gas stove on the baking sheet just like regular bakery. 'Bake' for 15 minutes. Then take the stones out ant start painting them with crayons. You'll get an amazing print in the end. I used blue, white and rose colors.
Another great hack. Take some stones and nail polish. Open the nail polish and simply start pouring it on the stones. Let it dry. Then you can use it as a jar lid decoration like I did.

Jury to decide fate of US teen gunman Kyle Rittenhouse - BBC News,"A jury has been sent to deliberate in the case of a teen who shot three men amid civil unrest last year, in one of the most high-profile trials in the US.

Wrapping up, prosecutors said Kyle Rittenhouse walked off like a ""hero in a Western"" after opening fire on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Mr Rittenhouse's lawyer said his client feared his own gun would be used on him after a ""crazy person"" ambushed him.

The 18-year-old killed two white men and injured a third on 25 August 2020, during protests following the police murder of black man George Floyd.

The Rittenhouse case was instantly politically divisive and its result is being closely watched across the nation.

While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

Protesters arrested as they run from Hong Kong campus - BBC News,"Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police.

A group of around 100 people tried to leave Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.

It is the third time protesters have tried to leave, following a violent and fiery overnight stand-off with police.

In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied the ban.

The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations.

2,000 miles (3,200 km) east of Moscow, in the city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, ordinary Russians told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg how they feel about the country's future - while the reporter was under surveillance.

Cost of Inaction: The Consequences of Failing the World's Children | The Forum at HSPH,"This Forum event explored the landmark ""Cost of Inaction"" initiative launched by the François-Xavier Bagnoud (FXB) Center for Health and Human Rights. The project examines the ""cost of inaction"" of a failure to respond appropriately to children -- addressing the complex challenges of enumerating and quantifying the multiple social and economic costs that follow when societies fail to address the pressing needs of their most vulnerable members. The project responds to hitherto unaddressed questions in public health: what are the costs of inaction, and is the cost of inaction greater than the cost of action. This event was presented April 16, 2013 in collaboration with GlobalPost.

UN urges world not to ignore east Africa drought and hunger crisis - BBC News,"The United Nations' aid chief has urged the international community not to ignore the devastating drought and hunger crisis facing east Africa.

Martin Griffiths of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the world has not been paying enough attention to crises beyond the war in Ukraine.

Twenty million people in the region are at risk of severe hunger, according to the UN.

Ethiopia is facing the country's worst drought in half a century, while 40 per cent of Somalia's population is facing food insecurity.

GALE - D Pic (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"GALE - D Pic (Live). Una sesión exclusiva para Vevo DSCVR, el canal donde encontrarás la mejor música emergente.

GALE describe su personalidad musical como si “Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa y Avril Lavigne tuvieran una bebé” y, sin más ni menos, ésta es la mejor descripción de la mezcla de géneros y la estética visual que definen a la puertorriqueña y la posicionan como una de las artistas latinas en rápido crecimiento en el ámbito cultural. GALE comenzó su carrera como letrista, convirtiéndose en la colaboradora go-to para artistas de la talla de Juanes y Jesse & Joy, quienes utilizaron varias canciones de su autoría para su álbum del 2022, ‘Clichés.’ Más impresionante aún, dos de su canciones, “Santo” y “Brujería”, fueron escogidas por Christina Aguilera para su disco en español ‘AGUILERA’, que ganó el premio en la categoría de Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album en los Latin GRAMMY 2022. Ahora, GALE se presenta como leading woman –empoderada, con mucha chispa, y un pop honesto, impredecible, y pegajoso que nos ha dejado a todos boquiabiertos. Su debut “D Pic” logró arremolinar a nuevos fans alrededor de Latinoamérica, y su balada pop “Nuestra Canción” tocó a tanta gente que llegó hasta el Top 10 de la lista Latin Pop Airplay de Billboard. “Cuando escribo para mí, usualmente viene de un lugar vulnerable, que da miedo”, dijo la artista a GRAMMY.com. “Es como un portal a mis sentimientos”. Invitamos a GALE a nuestro estudio en Nueva York para cantar “D Pic” y “La Mitad” en el escenario de DSCVR, ambas de su álbum debut, ‘Lo Que No Te Dije’.

GALE describes her musical personality as if “Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa, and Avril Lavigne had a baby” and we could not think of a better way to describe the fusion of genres, wordplay, and visual aesthetic that define the Puerto Rican singer and positions her as one of the Latinx artists on the rise in the cultural sphere. GALE started her career as a songwriter, turning herself into a go-to collaborator for influential pop stars like Juanes and Jesse & Joy, who used several of her songs for their Latin GRAMMY nominated 2022 album, ‘Clichés.’ Even more impressive, two of her tracks  –“Santo” and “Brujeria""– were handpicked by Christina Aguilera for her Spanish language album ‘AGUILERA’, which won the Latin GRAMMY in 2022 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. Now, GALE reintroduces herself as a leading woman –empowered, with an enviable spark, and a knack for pop that is honest, unpredictable and catchy. We were left with our mouths open when we heard her sing, and we’re sure she’ll leave you just the same. Her debut single “D Pic” surrounded her with new fans around Latin America, and her pop ballad “Nuestra Canción” reached so many people’s hearts that it made the Top 10 in Billboard’s Latin Pop Airplay chart. ""When I'm writing for myself, it usually comes from a very vulnerable or scary place,” she told GRAMMY.com. “It's like I'm opening a portal to my feelings."" We invited GALE into our New York City studio to sing “D Pic” and “La Mitad” live, both from her debut album ‘Lo Que No Te Dije.’

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Authentic Isaan Street Food in Bangkok at Som Tam Jay So (ร้านส้มตำเจ๊โส),"Located in Silom, Som Tam Jay So (ร้านส้มตำเจ๊โส) is one of my new favorite restaurants in Bangkok to eat som tam (green papaya salad). More on http://eatingthaifood.com/ (coming soon)

Silom is one of the biggest downtown and financial districts of Bangkok, and there are many good restaurants and street food stalls. And along with that, you’ll find an abundance of Isaan (northeastern Thailand) restaurants and street food stalls throughout Bangkok… but not all of them are that good. One day, while in Silom during lunch, Ying and I stopped at a place called Som Tam Jay So (ร้านส้มตำเจ๊โส) to eat some different types of Thai green papaya salad, and a few of their other specialities. It turned out to be some of the best som m, green papaya salad, that I’ve had in a long time in Bangkok. It’s now one of my favorite street food restaurants in Bangkok. Here are the dishes we ordered:

Som tam sua (ส้มตำซั่ว) - This is a green papaya salad with rice vermicelli noodles it. It also included a variety of other vegetables, plus lots of chilies, and fermented fish sauce. It was absolutely stunning.

Tam ba (ตำป่า) - For another plate of green papaya salad, we got the tam ba (ตำป่า), jungle style, with a big mixture of different ingredients, and again flavored heavily with fermented fish sauce. It was again incredibly delicious, unbelievably good.

Bik gai yang (ปีกไก่ย่าง) - Another thing they are famous for serving at Som Tam Jay So (ร้านส้มตำเจ๊โส) is grilled chicken wings. And the wings were so golden and crispy looking, that if it wasn’t for them telling me they were grilled I would have thought they were deep fried. The chicken wings were excellent, with flavor going all the way to the bone.

Kaw moo yang (คอหมูย่าง) - I wasn’t planning on ordering the fatty grilled pork neck, but when I saw it in the cabinet waiting to be served, I had to order it. The pork neck was absolutely incredible - it was tender and juicy, and you could really taste the grilled smoky flavor.

Tom Saeb moo (ต้มแซ่บหมู) - One of the popular soups in Isaan is tom Saeb moo (ต้มแซ่บหมู), a meaty and sour soup. This was pretty good, nice and spicy, and slightly sour with lots of meat and various pieces of intestine and other things in it.

Laab neau (ลาบเนื้อ) - The laab neau (ลาบเนื้อ), minced meat salad, was also incredibly delicious, with just the right flavor and plenty of chilies. 

Khao neow (ข้าวเหนียว) - Finally, no Isaan meal can be eaten without sticky rice.

Waves That Are Higher Than Empire State Building,"How big can a wave get? And what's the biggest wave ever recorded? Well, imagine that you’re standing at the top of the Empire State Building and see a massive wall of water coming right at you! Even a tsunami can’t be that high, but what about… a megatsunami? A regular tsunami is bad enough. As it comes closer to the coast, it can grow up to 160 feet high, or about 15 stories! But what if the wave height wasn’t hundreds, but thousands of feet? 

Sounds like some unrealistic plot for a disaster movie, but it has happened! These skyscrapers of waves are called megatsunamis. They are so huge, they could’ve wiped the dinosaurs off the face of this planet! And surprisingly, for a tsunami to get upgraded to “mega” status, it’s not all about size. But what causes them? And can a megatsunami happen today?

Crowdfunded hospital brings hope in Syria - BBC News,"After a children's hospital in Aleppo was bombed in 2016, British-Syrian doctor Rola Hallam decided to try to raise money to build a new one.
Her crowdfunding campaign raised £246,000 in two weeks. A building was located and renovated, and a convoy of trucks carried medical equipment and supplies from London, across Europe to the Turkey-Syria border.
Hope Hospital, run by the Independent Doctors Association, opened in 2017. Two years on, Dr Hallam visited it for the first time.
The Syrian and Russian governments have rejected accusations that their forces have targeted hospitals.
Physicians for Human Rights say they have documented 573 attacks on 350 medical facilities - mainly by Syrian government and allied forces - since 2011.

SUMMARY:
- Tim Cook, Richard Branson, and tons of other successful people are early birds, right? So from that moment on, my alarm was set for 5:30 in the morning.
- Next up was meditation. Doing this practice in the morning allows you to connect with yourself and kick-start your day with positive energy.
- After that, it's good to do an easy 2- to 3-minute workout. 
- Practicing meditation also didn't go so smoothly at the beginning. After trying numerous apps and techniques, I found that simple breathing works best for me.
- Having a quick workout wasn't a problem for me. Moreover, it really helped me get in touch with my body and shake off some of the tiredness before showering. 
- Making to-do lists for the day turned out to be exceptionally fulfilling and motivating. By day 10, I’d begun to make 2 lists a day: one for my personal goals and another for work tasks and responsibilities.
- About halfway through my experiment, I got into time management, which turned out to be another amazing discovery for me!
- When I found ways to upgrade my career, I turned to my personal life and added one more habit to my routine: writing morning pages. This endless stream of consciousness opened my eyes to numerous personal problems I never realized I had.
- Make it a habit to write down all the things you're grateful for every evening.
- Stay hydrated. Toward the end of my experiment, I read that having a glass of water before breakfast helps to wake up your digestive system and set it up nicely for the day. 
- Make yourself a smoothie. Natural smoothies are full of the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs as it wakes up.

"Organ Transplantation: Medical, Technological and Ethical Challenges | The Forum at HSPH","People die each day waiting on lists for lifesaving organs, and the rise of chronic diseases such as diabetes only increases the demand. With the need for scientific innovation and donor support becoming ever more critical, this Forum explored biomedical advances that promise to address the scarcity, as well as the efforts of medical leaders, advocates and policymakers to reduce the numbers waiting for transplants. Through 3-D printing, scaffolding, chips and other innovations, scientists made extraordinary strides in tissue engineering and developing artificial organs. This program looked at the potential of advances like these, along with the ongoing role of current donation programs; ethics of matching and allocation policies; controversies around buying and selling organs; and approaches such as “presumed consent”, used in some countries to increase supply, where patients are presumed to have given permission to donate their organs, unless they have explicitly opted out.

Part of The Dr. Lawrence H. and Roberta Cohn Forums, this event was presented May 20, 2016 in Collaboration with The Huffington Post and in Association with Harvard Health Publications.

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this sound listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders,
 is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.
 Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.

 Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

We stopped at some crazy rock formations that stretch over 9,000 square miles, saw llamas, foxes, and 6,000 flamingos, had lunch by the Black Lagoon, tried chewing coca leaves for the first time, and stayed at an awesome desert hotel in the middle of nowhere!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Featuring interviews from Alexander Rossi, Bryan Herta, Michael Andretti and other team members and experts, plus race day radio communications that bring audiences into the action during the nail-biting victory.",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzCNMnCgz0
What's in a President's Car to Keep Them Alive,"When I first saw that my car had a parking camera, I was thrilled. Then the new Tesla models blew me away. Remote engine start was definitely a feature from the future. But, the stuff inside these cars makes my little sedan seem like a useless tin can. Do you know, for example, what equipment is in a fire truck? Anything that firefighters might need is found there! They have axes and crowbars, and the ""jaws of life"" - a super-strong tool to get people out of cars.

But firefighters are not the only ones at an emergency. Paramedics can literally save lives. And ambulances are complicated vehicles. We all know that ambulances have a rolling bed, an IV, and a heart monitor. But there's so much more! After all, an ambulance needs to be ready for anything! This simple-looking machine can vaporize liquid medication into a mist. Still not impressed? Then how about to look into the car of the President of the United States? The beast of modern car technology. No, it's literally nicknamed ""The Beast.""

Saudi Arabia reforms: Are they good news for women? - BBC News,"A recent announcement gave more freedoms to women, but there are concerns they don't go far enough.

The new rule announced on Friday allows women over the age of 21 to apply for a passport without authorisation, putting them on an equal footing to men. Women are also being given the right to register births, marriage or divorce.

But the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia remains in the spotlight. BBC gender and identity reporter, Megha Mohan explains why.

FULL Documentary: Scandal of US teen locked up without trial - BBC News,"Tyler Haire, was a 16 year old with a long history of mental health issues, when he was arrested for stabbing his father's girlfriend with a 10-inch butcher knife. He waited nearly four years to get a mental evaluation before his case could go to trial. 

He's slated to get out of jail in late 2018 - and he hasn't been treated since he's been incarcerated. 

There are dozens of legally innocent inmates stuck in Mississippi's county jails every year, their trials delayed for months and years because the state is unable to give them a pretrial mental evaluation. Local sheriffs are unequipped to deal with their mental health needs.

Gracie Abrams - Friend (Live) | Vevo DSCVR At Home,"Gracie Abrams - Friend. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Gracie Abrams knows how to captivate an audience, in the most modern sense. Without ever having played a proper live gig, the L.A. native has cultivated an adoring online fan base. On one hand, the 21-year-old’s discography is a landscape of fiercely emotional lyrics wrapped inside gentle songs. So gentle, she lowers her voice to barely a whisper on “minor,” which she wrote when she was 17 and now serves as the title track to her debut EP. On the other hand, her 300k Insta followers get an equally real product: a blend of normie selfies, cute Spongebob memes and worries about the existential crises marking 2020's daily life. None of this is to say Abrams lacks performance chops. Plans for a summer tour were derailed due to you know what. Making the best of things, she’s done plenty of livestreams and, of course, this DSCVR at Home acoustic session. She sang “Friend” while sitting on a rope swing, as if viewers had happily stumbled onto a cozy backyard jam.

"Paloma Mami - ""Not Steady"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Paloma Mami – “Not Steady” (Live) | Vevo DSCVR

It’s hard to figure out what’s moving faster — Paloma Mami’s career ascent or the BPMs to her music. The New York-reared, Chilean artist exploded onto the scene in 2018 with her independently released “Not Steady,” a Spanglish viral sensation that left a huge digital footprint. The track was the first she ever recorded (!) and set her up to ink a contract with Sony Music Latin. The 19-year-old singer followed up her debut single with a pair of contrasting odes to love, “No Te Enamores,” about a girl who won’t fall in love, and “Fingías,” a record about a woman who is getting over a heartbreak. Here, Vevo introduces Paloma Mami as our next DSCVR artist with a pair of performances and a heady expectation that her penchant for pulsating numbers will deliver more hits for years to come. Hold tight.

"Matthew Perry: Arrests made over Friends star’s death, US media reports | BBC News","At least one person has been arrested over the death of Friends star Matthew Perry, according to US media.

Perry was found unresponsive at his Los Angeles home in October last year. A post-mortem examination found levels of ketamine in the actor's blood similar to that used for general anaesthesia during surgery.

LA police opened an investigation into his death in May to determine why Perry had so much of the drug in his system.

Multiple people had been arrested and are facing federal charges, ABC News reported. Other outlets, including NBC News, said at least one arrest had been made.

Lyrics: 

(Lathan) 
Now it’s ugh I don’t think they really know what it’s like 
When you comin’ from the bottom 
If I had it my way 
I’d get back to where I started 
Just to switch it up a little
Red wine no Bacardi
And we gonna throw our own kinda party 
Reminiscing about the old times 
When it didn’t get so complicated 
Once you moved up out the hood
You thought you made it
Let them good times roll 
And you don’t even need congratulations
But if they tellin’ us we’ll take it

(Tyler)
If I had it my way 
Every day would be a Friday 
We’d be ridin’ with the windows down 
If I had it my way 
I’d hit a hundred on the highway 
With the radio turnt up loud 
If I had it my way 
We would party all night 
Wouldn’t worry about a thing 
Everybody’d be fine 
If I had it my way (had it my way, had it my way)
My way (had it my way, had it my way)
Yeah, baby

(Lathan)
Tyler what’s good 

(Tyler)
What’s shaken Lathan
Whachu know good (What up) 
Asked me if I wanna sing a banger 
Boy I sure would (haha)
Buddy it’s on its going down in the ville (ahh yeah)
And I don’t think they ready if I’m really bein’ real
What’s the deal when a couple good ole country boys get up on the track (Let’s go) 
You can feel it through the speakers we got bumpin in the back (whoo)
Hope you know we goin’ big 
That’s the only way to go
Come on over my way and let’s roll

(Tyler)
If I had it my way 
Every day would be a Friday 
We’d be ridin’ with the windows down 
If I had it my way 
I’d hit a hundred on the highway 
With the radio turnt up loud 
If I had it my way 
We would party all night 
Wouldn’t worry about a thing 
Everybody’d be fine 
If I had it my way (had it my way, had it my way)
My way (had it my way, had it my way)

(Lathan)
Legoo
City raised off of country ways
Horses and Jay’s 
We stick together 
Livin’ life like it’s made in the shade. 
It ain’t a secret yeah, we all know we numbered on days 
Ha until he take us away

(Tyler)
If I had it my way 
Every day would be a Friday 
We’d be ridin’ with the windows down 
If I had it my way 
I’d hit a hundred on the highway 
With the radio turnt up loud 
If I had it my way 
We’d party all night 
Wouldn’t worry about a thing 
Everybody’d be fine 
If I had it my way (had it my way, had it my way)

Health & Medicine on Khan Academy: No organ quite symbolizes love like the heart. One reason may be that your heart helps you live, by moving ~5 liters (1.3 gallons) of blood through almost 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) of blood vessels every single minute! It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love. Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound “Lub Dub.”

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

Summer On You Lyrics:

Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

Darling I've been working all week
I've got so much on my plate
Always saying ""poor me""
Although my boss is an a-hole
That's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan
To hit the road with me 
I'll pick you up after and-

We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight 
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'

Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm singin' hey babe
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel the love like this
Stronger than anyone else

We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage 
So let me spend this pocket change
We'll drink beer like it's champagne 
And stay out kissin' in the rain
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'

Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, I know baby we ain't got no money
All we got is love
But I know that can see us through
It might sound crazy
But why do we need sunshine?
When we can stay and sip warm beer
While holed up in a room
That's how we spend my summer on you 

Baby, I ain't got no money 
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Oh I will spend my summer on you
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh I will spend my summer on you",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MsOON5lkzU
"Street Food in Thailand - NIGHT MARKET Thai Food in Chiang Mai, Thailand!","SUBSCRIBE http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every week
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

One of the top things to do in Chiang Mai is walk around and eat through one of the many Chiang Mai night markets - I think Chiang Mai might be the capital of night markets in the world. There’s a night market for every day of the week and some of them stretch longer than you can see. 

At night markets in Chiang Mai you’ll find a huge selection of things to buy, from clothes and antiques to even entertainment like music and Thai massage. But for food lovers, the best thing about visiting any Thai night market is the food.

On Sunday night in Chiang Mai the most popular night market is Tha Pae Walking Street (ตลาดท่าแพ) - it really is an entire street that shuts down for a couple of kilometers, and the entire street is filled with things to look at, buy, and eat. Most of the food is set up in designated area, especially in the small courtyards of temples.

In this Thai street food tour of Chiang Mai, the plan was just to walk around and see what looked good to eat.

Here’s what we ate:

Sai krok Isaan (ไส้กรอกอีสาน), Sai ua (ไส้อั่ว) - This impressive cart was filled with different varieties of Thai sausage, both Isaan style sausage, and Northern Thai herb sausage.
Total price - 30 THB ($0.91)

Pork meatballs (ลูกชิ้นหมู) - I’m usually not a huge fan, but these 100% pork meatballs were pretty tasty.
Price - 40 THB ($1.21)

Pork ham (หมูยอ) - After meeting up with my friends Tom, Joel, and JJ, they had already been snacking on some moo yaw, a Vietnamese style ham sausage.

Grilled egg (ไข่ป่าม) - This is a unique Northern Thai food, of grilled egg.
Price - 30 THB ($0.91) 

Sticky rice (ข้าวหนุกงา) - One of the Thai snacks I had never tried before were sticky rice patties. They were interesting and quite tasty.
Price - 20 THB ($0.61)

Pork ribs (ซี่โครงหมู), Crab egg custard (อ่องปู) - We saw the ribs being grilled and couldn't’t resist. They were alright, but the paddy crab egg custard was more unique.
Price - 180 THB ($5.46) 

Durian (ทุเรียน) - Finally, although a little overpriced, and not season, we couldn’t resist a little nugget of durian to end this Chiang Mai night market Thai food tour.
Price - 200 THB ($6.06)

Aral Sea: The sea that dried up in 40 years - BBC News,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
The disappearance of the Aral Sea in Central Asia is one of the world's greatest man-made disasters. In Kazakhstan, with the help of the World Bank, more than $80million have been spent trying to save the most northern part of the sea but this has only benefited a few hundred people. In this film, we speak to people still living in deserted fishing ports, to see how their lives have changed, and to find out whether they believe that they'll ever see the sea again.

Tauren Wells - Empty (VEVO Sessions),"Tauren Wells - Empty. An exclusive live performance for Vevo. 

There’s an art to crafting Christian pop, and Tauren Wells has it mastered. The Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter has separated himself as an artist who can put faith-based messages in a youthful, modern context - a strong communicator. In 2018, “Known” rose to the upper echelons of the Hot Christian Songs chart. The same year, Wells became a worship leader at Lakewood Church, one of the largest congregations in America. So yeah, he has no issue preaching to the masses. His “Fake It” and “Empty” performance made our studio feel 100x bigger. “I was chasing counterfeits / Tryin to find a fix / But all that I was missing was You,” he sings in the former track. There’s layers to Wells’ message, and he makes finding truth fun along the way.

Lyrics:
With every single breath
We break the power of death
We’re speaking life in Jesus name
We’re trading chains for crowns
We’ve seen the walls come down
This generation’s full of faith

What was lost
Is forever found
To the God who saves
Make a holy sound

We lift up praise
We lift up praises
Who the Son sets free is free indeed
I’m not ashamed to say

I’m free
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
I’m free
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

I’m never turning back
I’m on a one-way path
My every step is led by grace
My futures in Your hands
I’m in the promise land
You are the God who makes a way

Sing
What was lost
Is forever found
To the God who saves
Make a holy sound

We lift up praise
We lift up praises
Who the Son sets free is free indeed
I’m not ashamed to say
We lift up praise
We lift up praises
Who the Son sets free is free indeed
I’m not ashamed to say

I’m free

Na-na-na-na

Fear, shame, depressions gotta go
I'm living with the power of the Holy Ghost
Faith, joy, Your presence is my hope
I'm living for Your glory and to make You known
(Come on, somebody declare tonight)
Fear, shame, depressions gotta go
I'm living with the power of the Holy Ghost
Faith, joy, Your presence is my hope
I'm living for Your glory and to make

Greek islands aim to go 'Covid-free' to welcome back tourists - BBC News,"Greece's islands have an ambitious plan to lure back visitors this summer - by vaccinating all local residents.
 
In 2020, the country welcomed only 25% of its usual numbers of visitors.
 
The goal of ""Operation Blue Freedom"" is to turn the country's islands, such as Milos, into ""Covid-free"" travel destinations.
 
Many of Milos' locals rely on tourism and welcome the plan to reopen. But not everyone is as optimistic.

The history and future of the B-52 - BBC News,"The B-52 is the US Air Force's ""heavyweight of the skies"". The six-engine military plane has been involved in conflicts since the 1950s - and three generations of pilots have flown in one.
And its not expected to go away - the B-52 programme is planned to continue until 2040, as its range and capacity is unique among US military planes.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

""We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence can certainly kill."" It's been twenty years since Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1999. At the awards ceremony, Dr. James Orbinski, then president of MSF’s International Council, used the platform to speak out against Russia’s bombing of civilians in Chechnya—and call for the protection of humanitarian action. Twenty years later, we reaffirm our commitment to providing independent, impartial medical care to the people who need it most. ""Humanitarian responsibility has no frontiers,"" Orbinski said in his speech. Decades later, these words still ring true.

First song - “Take Five”

From Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Sudan khalwas: Undercover in the schools that chain boys - BBC News,"A BBC News Arabic investigation has uncovered systemic child abuse and evidence of sexual abuse inside Islamic schools in Sudan.

For 18 months, reporter Fateh Al-Rahman Al-Hamdani filmed inside 23 schools across the country.

Boys as young as five-years-old were routinely chained, shackled and beaten by the sheikhs or religious men in charge of the schools.

Mohamed Nader is one of those who was abused. He was imprisoned and tortured for five days, and received such a brutal beating that he nearly died.

Al-Hamdani spoke to him about what happened, his recovery, and his family's fight for justice in a country where the sheikhs still wield huge power and influence.

Reporter: Fateh Al-Rahman Al-Hamdani; Narration: Paul Bakibinga; Filmed by: Jess Kelly; Edited by: Bettina Waked; Producer: Mamdouh Akbiek; Exec Producers: Mustafa Khalili & Simon Cox

"SAS unit repeatedly killed detainees in Afghanistan, investigation finds - BBC News","SAS operatives in Afghanistan repeatedly killed detainees and unarmed men in suspicious circumstances, according to a BBC investigation.

Newly obtained military reports suggest that one unit may have unlawfully killed 54 people in one six-month tour.

The BBC found evidence suggesting the former head of special forces failed to pass on evidence to a murder inquiry.

A Ministry Of Defence spokesperson said that British forces ""served with courage and professionalism"" in Afghanistan and were held to the ""highest standards"".

                      'WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 
⭐Qui est MSF?
MSF est une organisation humanitaire médicale internationale créée par des médecins et des journalistes en France en 1971. MSF fournit une aide dans près de 80 pays à des personnes dont la survie est menacée par la violence, la négligence ou la catastrophe, principalement en raison de conflits armés, d'épidémies, de malnutrition, d'exclusion de soins de santé ou catastrophes naturelles. MSF fournit une assistance indépendante et impartiale à ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. MSF a reçu le prix Nobel de la paix en 1999 et le prix King Hussein pour l'action humanitaire en 2004.

Quel est le travail de MSF?
Dans les situations d'urgence et leurs suites, MSF fournit des soins de santé, réhabilite et gère des hôpitaux et des cliniques, effectue des interventions chirurgicales, lutte contre les épidémies, mène des campagnes de vaccination, gère des centres d'alimentation pour les enfants souffrant de malnutrition et propose des soins de santé mentale. Au besoin, MSF construit également des puits et distribue de l'eau potable, et fournit des matériaux d'abri tels que des couvertures et des bâches en plastique.

MSF est-elle une agence des Nations Unies?
Non. MSF est une organisation indépendante qui fonctionne sans aucun programme politique, militaire ou religieux. Les activités de MSF ne sont liées à aucune des agences des Nations Unies. Cependant, MSF peut plaider auprès des Nations Unies sur les problèmes médicaux et humanitaires courants.

Où travaille MSF?
MSF travaille principalement dans les pays où elle a trouvé des services insuffisants pour répondre aux besoins médicaux d'une population. MSF est présent dans plus de 60 pays à travers le monde en Asie, en Afrique, en Europe et en Amérique latine.

Les services MSF sont-ils gratuits?
Oui. Tous les services MSF sont gratuits. MSF rejette l'idée que les pays pauvres méritent des soins médicaux de troisième ordre et s'efforce de fournir des soins de haute qualité aux patients et recherche du personnel hautement professionnel (médical et non médical). Par exemple, dans la mission MSF qui soigne les blessés de guerre irakiens, MSF couvre toutes les dépenses liées au traitement, y compris les frais de voyage, d'hébergement, etc.

D'où vient l'argent de MSF?
La clé de la capacité de MSF à agir de manière indépendante en réponse à une crise est son financement privé et indépendant. En 2015, 92% des revenus de MSF provenaient de sources privées. Plus de 5,7 millions de donateurs individuels et de fondations privées dans le monde ont rendu cela possible.

La présence de MSF est-elle toujours basée sur une base temporaire ou d'urgence?
MSF ne représente pas une alternative pour les formations sanitaires des pays où elle intervient. MSF essaie de combler le vide des besoins médicaux et humanitaires. Lorsque ces besoins sont satisfaits, MSF cède la place aux établissements de santé locaux et apporte son soutien aux autres populations dans le besoin.

EU proposes ban on Russian oil imports following Ukraine invasion – BBC News,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, including a total ban on oil imports from Russia by the end of 2022.

""[Vladimir] Putin must pay a high price for his brutal aggression,"" von der Leyen told members of the European Parliament on Wednesday.

The plans, which need the approval of member states, also include sanctions on individuals, including those suspected of war crimes.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, responded calling the sanctions a ""double-edged"" weapon, adding that “the cost of these sanctions to the citizens of Europe will grow by the day”.

Hong Kong arrests dozens as 'anti-protest' law kicks in - BBC News,"Dozens of people have been arrested in Hong Kong, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag, after a new ""anti-protest"" law imposed by Beijing came into effect, officials say.

Police have used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended.

The national security law targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison.

Critics say it stops some freedoms meant to be guaranteed by China.

Brazil has recorded its highest daily rise in the number of deaths from the coronavirus, health officials say.

It registered 881 new deaths on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The total death toll now stands at 12,400.

It means Brazil, which is at the centre of the Latin American outbreak, is now the sixth worst affected country in terms of recorded deaths.

And experts say the real figure may be far higher due to a lack of testing in the country.

""Brazil is only testing people who end up in the hospital,"" Domingo Alves from the University of Säo Paulo Medical School told AFP news agency.

What Would Happen If Plane Doors Opened?,"What Happens If Plane Doors Open? What if the plane engine fails? What if a bird crashes into my plane? What if the plane flies too high?
A lot of people are scared out of their wits each time they fasten their seatbelts on an airplane, even though, you have no real reason to worry about flying. You will certainly feel safe aboard if you know the answers to some common worrying plane questions.

TIMESTAMPS
What would happen if you opened the door of the plane mid- flight? 2:13
What would happen if a bird hit your plane? 3:22
What would happen if your plane got struck by lightning? 5:03
What would happen if your plane flew too high? 6:10
What would happen if your plane crashed into the ocean? 7:28

Music: 
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

SUMMARY
-If you opened plane door mid-flight, all the passengers sitting close to the exit would be sucked out of the cabin and flung into the sky. The temperature onboard the aircraft would quickly plummet, and the plane would probably begin to break apart. To save your life, you’d have about 15 to 20 seconds to put on your oxygen mask.
-If a 12-pound Canadian goose hits an aircraft that’s flying at a speed of 150 miles per hour, the force of the collision will be equal to 1,000 pounds falling from a height of 10 feet. The engine would definitely shut down. But it absolutely doesn't mean that a tragedy would ensue.
-Standard commercial airplanes were designed to easily take lightning strikes. When air operators divert planes around stormy areas, they do this not because of the potential danger of lightning but to avoid turbulence or external damage to the aircraft that can be caused by hail, for instance. 
-Passenger planes aren't designed to fly higher than an altitude of 7.5 miles. If it did fly too high, this could get really nasty. There have been several cases of planes crashing after trying to climb too high.
-Modern airplanes are designed in a way that improves their chances of landing on water successfully. All air valves that might be submerged in the event of a plane ditching on water are controlled by the pilot and can be closed by a switch on the flight deck so that they don’t let any water in. Planes nowadays can also float on water for at least half an hour.

2016 Tour d'Elegance: Automotive Art in Motion,"Automobile gives us a peek at the 2016 Tour d'Elegance. Initiated to showcase the elegance of the automobile in motion, the Tour also underscores the early history of the place that is Pebble Beach. Decades before golf links were laid out along the edge of the Pacific Ocean, this area was known for its scenic drive, winding for miles through the pine and cypress forest, dancing alongside dramatic cliffs and leading, ultimately, to a beautiful crescent-shaped bay.

Riot police deployed in Guatemala after protesters breach Congress - BBC News,"Riot police were deployed onto the streets of Guatemala City after a group of army veterans breached the Congress building, forcing staff to evacuate.

Lawmakers and office workers were evacuated as the group set cars alight in the car park, and caused damage to the main building.

Military veterans have been protesting for several weeks, demanding approval of a law which would give them compensation for time served during Guatemala's long running civil war, dating from 1960-1996.

Gene Editing: Promises and Challenges,"In labs and in clinical trials, scientists are seeking ways to rewrite DNA, a building block of life. Tools such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) and, more recently, CRISPR/Cas9 have the power to seek out and replace faulty DNA. The possibilities seem almost limitless: with the ability to edit DNA at will, researchers theoretically could wipe out malaria-causing mosquitos, make disease- and pest-proof crops without the need for pesticides, and cure genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. Cancer is another target, with human clinical trials using CRISPR already underway, while, in separate efforts, HIV has been reportedly eliminated in mice thanks to the tool.

But scientists and ethicists alike are worried about the speed at which the gene editing field is moving — and the implications of the results. In this panel, we discussed the promises and challenges presented by gene editing for individual and public health. What scientific and ethical hurdles must be overcome before tools like CRISPR and others can move safely and more widely out of the lab and into fields, farms, and hospitals

However recent deaths linked to self-driving technology have caused concern about safety and have raised questions about whether the field is moving too quickly.

Divorce - Hangman (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Divorce - Hangman | Vevo DSCVR

For a band named after the dissolution of marriage, Divorce has some ironically good chemistry. Its members - Felix Mackenzie-Barrow, Tiger Cohen-Towell, Adam Smith & Kasper Sandstrøm - hail from Nottingham’s “close knit” music scene. As a result, the quartet have known and admired one another since their teenage days; High school relationships tend to end in break-ups, but this four’s creative bonds only strengthened over time. Having officially formed around 2021, Divorce deployed two EPs in back to back years: ‘Get Mean’ (2022) and ‘Heady Metal’ (2023). In hindsight, the first EP felt like a trust-building exercise, whereas the second pushed the emotional envelope a bit further. “Before, I felt like we were very much writing for Divorce, and trying to figure out what we wanted to say as a band,” said Tiger around the time of the release of ‘Heady Metal.’ If those first two projects were about finding and staking out intrapersonal balance, then the band’s debut album, ‘Drive To Goldenhammer,’ is a totem of collective transcendence, like slipping a forever ring on a soulmate’s finger. Tiger and Felix’s voices intertwine throughout, and one can hear the Queen influence come through on tracks such as “Lord” and “Hangman.” Like all relationships there’s moments of blissful, loving clarity - best exemplified on the astoundingly beautiful album opener “Antarctica” - followed by teetering collapses into distortion (“Karen” and “Jet Show”). In the DSCVR studio, they presented a united front. “We want our music to make people feel seen,” said Tiger.""

Pakistan locust plague: Locals collect insects for chicken feed - BBC News,"Chickens in Pakistan's Punjab province are feasting on tonnes of locusts, which have been collected by locals affected by the infestation.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has endorsed the pilot project which pays people to bag the insects for chicken feed, as the country struggles to contain the most devastating swarms in 25 years.

Collectors are trained on the best methods to catch the locusts, which is at night when they cluster to trees, and earn 20 rupees (12 cents) per kilogram.

Although the initiative had to be paused in Punjab province because of funding issues, the government hopes to expand the project to other locations.

"Ten dead after vehicle drives into large crowd in New Orleans, authorities say | BBC News","Ten people have died and 30 are injured after a vehicle drove into a large crowd in New Orleans, according to authorities.

Videos on social media that appear to have been recorded today at the scene of the incident show multiple casualties on the ground. Gunfire can be heard in the background and people can be seen running from the area.

The incident occurred at approximately 03:15 local time (09:15 GMT) on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter - a popular tourist destination in the city.

Witnesses told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the driver of the vehicle then got out and started firing a weapon.

UK to sign deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing - BBC News,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to unveil  plans that will see some asylum seekers flown to Rwanda in order to have their asylum applications processed.

The trial scheme would mean single men arriving in Britain via Channel crossings could be forcibly removed.

Refugee organisations have criticised the plans as cruel and urged a rethink.

The deal is expected to see the Rwanda, which is part of the Commonwealth, given an initial £120m as part of a trial, but opponents say the annual cost of the full scheme would be far higher.

There might be some bacteria growing in your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. When you order a drink that isn’t supposed to have cinnamon in it but still smells like it -  someone might have messed with it and tried adding some ingredients that shouldn't really be there. Some smells only seem dangerous but are perfectly normal.

Theresa May: I regret need for Brexit delay - BBC News,"Theresa May has arrived in Brussels, telling reporters that she ""regrets"" the need for the emergency summit because the UK ""should have left the EU by now"".

Talks between the government and Labour have been ""serious and constructive"", she says, but the UK needs ""extra time"" to ensure it can leave in a ""smooth and orderly way"".

The important thing, she says, is that any extension to Article 50 allows the UK to leave the EU ""at the point at which we ratify the deal"".

""That would enable us to leave by the 22 May,"" she adds.

Theresa May has arrived at the EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The prime minister addressed reporters, ahead of meeting EU leaders and Council president Donald Tusk.

Myanmar's UK ambassador locked out of embassy by military attaché - BBC News,"Myanmar's former ambassador in London spent a night in his car after saying he was locked out of his embassy.

Kyaw Zwar Minn said staff were asked to leave the building by Myanmar's military attaché, and he was dismissed as the country's representative. 

The ex-envoy has criticised the military coup in the country, and called for Myanmar's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be released.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has condemned the ""bullying actions,"" but the UK has accepted the change.

Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai charged under security law - BBC News,"Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the territory's controversial new national security law.

Mr Lai, 73, is accused of conspiring with foreign forces to endanger national security, and could face a lengthy jail term.

He is the most high-profile person charged under the new law.

Mr Lai founded the Apple Daily newspaper and is a fierce critic of the Beijing authorities.

Beijing has said the new security law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest, but critics say it has silenced dissent.

Serious Klein - The Shaw (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022,"Serious Klein - The Shaw. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2022, an annual series highlighting those that are shaping the future of music. 

Maybe it’s best to start with a fan’s testimony when talking about Serious Klein: “Flow is 20 outta 10 / Visuals 20 outta 10,” said a commenter on last spring’s “Numero Uno” video. Obviously the remark of a zealot, but the kind of skills that Klein exhibits definitely live up to such praise. We invited the 30-year-old German ace to be part of DSCVR Artists To Watch 2022 for similar reasons: imagination, authority, and casual swag are part of the very seductive Klein package. From 2012’s ‘Serious Outlook,’ back when he was an underground sensation, to this year’s pulsing “Down,” now that he’s an impressive global newcomer with shoutouts from Alicia Keys and other bigwigs, Klein has trusted his musical instincts and moved towards a place of respect, not chasing chart hits, but crafting coolness each time he steps to the mic. “Where he thrives as a hyphy rapper with rare lyrical ability in tow,” said writer Evan Dale three years ago, “he equals and even further excels as an artist capable of slowing down his flow, switching up his demeanor, and pursuing his music at a more relaxed, introspective level.” Raised in Hannover and proud of his Ghanaian heritage, Klein has said that if you want to make the biggest dent possible with your records, it’s a must to spit in English. He does so with a flair for accenting powerful phrases. Check the provocative and arty visuals of 2018’s “Voodoo Money.” Check the heartfelt emotion in the powerhouse ode to the late dad he grew up without, “Lil Capo.” Check the agility he brought to the stage when we captured “Numero Uno” and ""The Shaw"" for ATW 2022. Seems like lots more people should know about Mr. Klein and his fierce outlook on life. Here’s hoping our performances help that cause.

Growing evidence of Taliban reprisal arrests and killings in Afghanistan – BBC News,"A number of women who participated in protests demanding women’s rights in Afghanistan are missing.

The Taliban deny they are holding them.

They say they have granted a general amnesty to all those who worked with the previous regime.

Thousands in US flee as Hurricane Ida bears down on Louisiana - BBC News,"Tens of thousands of people are fleeing the US state of Louisiana as Hurricane Ida closes in from the Gulf of Mexico.

Ida is now a category four hurricane, one below the highest level, with up to 150mph (240km/h) sustained winds.

It is expected to make landfall on Sunday, bringing a ""life-threatening"" storm surge. Ida is likely to be stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated much of New Orleans in 2005.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s 

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

Sudan: The people who survived June 3 - BBC News,"Sudan’s military rulers have admitted that they ordered the security operation that led to the killing of at least 100 protesters last week.

Troops and government-backed militia groups moved into Khartoum, attacking protesters who were demanding a return to civilian rule, following the removal of former President Omar Al-Bashir.

The BBC's Africa editor Fergal Keane has been talking to some of those who witnessed the violence in Khartoum.

"I Learned These 8 Tricks at School, But They Still Work","Some common tricks are so useful and simple they can come in handy to more than one generation. However, over time, they’re somehow forgotten, and they turn into what’s called ""grandma’s tips."" 
We decided to recall the past and collected eight great tricks from childhood, which everyone forgot.

TIMESTAMPS
Determine the time left before sunset 0:31
Know if the moon is waxing or waning 0:57
Know the degrees of an angle 1:22
Memory trick 1:53
Check battery quality 2:24
Multiplication on fingers 2:42
Length 4:11
Know the number of days in a month 4:55

#mathgames #mathtricks

SUMMARY
- Keep your fingers together, and reach your hand out so that the sun ""lies"" on your index finger. Now count the number of fingers on the horizon line. Each of the fingers represents approximately 15 minutes until sunset.
- To determine the moon phase easily, use the shape of the letters D, O, and C. The full moon is O, the first quarter is D, and the third is C. 
In other words, the letter ‘C’ will mean ‘waning,' and the letter D – ‘waxing.'
- Spread your fingers as much as possible, and put your palm on a surface, the angle of which you want to measure. The little finger should lie on the bottom side: it means 0°. The angle between the thumb and the little finger will be 90°, the angles between the little finger and other fingers are, respectively, 30°, 45°, and 60°.
- Make a fist, and start counting the months by knuckles. Each knuckle bump and gap is a separate month. If you count on one hand, then, after reaching the end, start again with the knuckles of the index finger. Let’s see: January, February, March, April, May, June, July.
Now, the right hand: August, September, October, November, and December.
If the month is on the knuckle bump, there are 31 days. If it’s on the gap — 30 or less.
- If you need to measure an object approximately but there’s no ruler at hand, you can use the fingers of one hand. 
By the average human proportions, the distance between the tips of the thumb and forefinger is about 7 inches (18 cm), and the distance between the thumb and little finger is about 7.87 inches (20 cm).

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

US super-rich 'pay almost no income tax' - BBC News,"Details claiming to reveal how little income tax US billionaires pay have been leaked to a news website.

ProPublica says it has seen the tax returns of some of the world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett.

The website alleges Amazon's Jeff Bezos paid no tax in 2007 and 2011, while Tesla's Elon Musk paid nothing in 2018.

A White House spokeswoman called the leak ""illegal"", and the FBI and tax authorities are investigating.

England's Muslim Cricketers - BBC News,"Moeen Ali and others reveal what it takes to be Asian, Muslim and playing for England. As the Ashes starts, the ""beard that's feared"" discusses being made a ""poster boy"" for Islam. Presenter Ankur Desai also visits Adil Rashid, Haseeb Hameed and Zafar Ansar to discuss their journeys to the top of the game. Back in November 2016, the four British Muslims played in the starting England cricket team to take on India in Rajkot - a first. Since then those who run cricket have become increasingly concerned about how few South Asians are making the transition from grassroots to professional career. Ankur explores what's being done to draw minorities to the game and asks whether this group of British Asians can inspire the next generation of players.

The heartbreak behind “See You Again” YouTube's most viewed song - BBC News,"The co-writer of “See You Again”, which has surpassed Gangnam Style as the most viewed song on YouTube, has spoken of his personal heartbreak behind the lyrics.

Justin Franks told BBC Radio 5 live’s Phil Williams that he cried when he wrote the song, dedicated to a close friend who died and late Fast and Furious franchise actor Paul Walker.

The ballad, sung by Charlie Puth featuring Wiz Khalifa, has been streamed almost 2.9 billion times – which would take 21,759 years to watch. The song has been featured in Fast and Furious 7, the film Walker was in the middle of shooting when he died.

Franks said: ""I made music for the club and radio but I also made music that mattered"".

This clip is originally from Phil Williams on Tuesday 11 July 2017.

Khao Moo Daeng at Si Morakot Restaurant (ข้าวหมูแดงสีมรกต),"Read the full blog post about Khao Moo Daeng Si Morakot (ข้าวหมูแดงสีมรกต) here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2016/01/khao-moo-daeng-si-morakot/ 

Khao moo daeng (ข้าวหมูแดง) is a Thai Chinese dish of rice topped with bbq pork (char siu), sometimes crispy pork belly, Chinese sausage, and then a thick red sauce all over it. It’s a dish that’s very common throughout Bangkok and Thailand, but in my opinion it’s a Thai street food dish that’s pretty hard to get right - there are a lot of bad versions that taste like meat and rice and ketchup sauce all over it.

But there are still some old traditional shops in Bangkok like Khao Moo Daeng Si Morakot (ข้าวหมูแดงสีมรกต) that serve great red bbq rice. They still make all the ingredients themself, roasting and curing the meats, and roasting them with charcoal the old style way - and it makes all the difference. The thick sauce is red brown in color and is made from a combination of the boiled pork bones reduced, plus a mixture of Chinese herbal spices, and both soybeans and sesame seeds. The sauce tasted to me like a combination of brown gravy and western style bbq sauce. It was tangy and sweet, but had a deep meaty flavor to it as well.

I got the biggest plate included a bit of everything, in Thai called khao moo daeng moo krob pisayt puem kai (ข้าวหมูแดงหมูกรอบเพิ่มไข่), rice with red bbq pork, crispy pork belly, egg, and the special large size. I would say that it was one of the best versions of the dish I’ve had in Bangkok and well worth seeking it out.

Linear model for painting

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

SOUTH SUDAN   State of emergency declared after flooding,"Please Like and Subscribe MSF International ❤🙌
Your Subscription is Donation for Us  🏆

The government of South Sudan has declared a state of emergency in 27 flood-affected areas across the country, which are estimated to have impacted between 800,000 – 900,000 people.

MSF is present in several of these areas and we are concerned about the severe consequences of flooding for communities we are there to support and those we cannot reach.

In Pibor, one of the worst affected areas, living conditions for the displaced population are deteriorating. The space is increasingly congested, thick with mud, has no latrines and just one functioning borehole.

The main diseases we are seeing are #malaria, acute watery diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections – all water-borne and vector-borne diseases we expect to see a rapid increase in with a flood situation and disproportionately affecting children under five.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

International Date Line Looks Truly Bizarre – But Why?,"The International Date Line (IDL) is one of the weirdest things on the map—it’s not a straight line at all! It zigzags to avoid splitting countries, islands, and even some communities into different days, which would be super confusing. Imagine one side of your house being a day ahead of the other! It mostly follows the 180° longitude line but takes big detours around places like Kiribati and Samoa so they can stay on the same date as their neighbors. This bending of the line makes it look strange, but it helps people in those areas keep their calendars in sync. Without the IDL, figuring out the time and date for travel, shipping, and even calling someone would be a chaotic mess.

LEARN ABOUT BLOG MONETIZATION STRATEGIES
https://youtu.be/SdWuaD0l2wQ 
Starting a blog can be your way out of the corporate world, it can be your way to spend more time with your family, be location-independent and travel the world, it can be your place for creative writing. 

It can be so many great things but at the beginning everything seems so overwhelming! Especially the burden of making choices. Not only the technical part of the process, like which hosting provider to use, which website building platform, etc. But even a more difficult decision is to choose the blog niche or the main topic for your website. 

You have to think of a niche that will be profitable but at the same time, it has to be something that you are genuinely interested in writing about – otherwise, you will have an early burnout. 

I don’t know you personally and I have no idea what YOU would be interested in writing and researching about, but I can tell you what are the most profitable blogging niches out there today.

So, in this video I will first tell you how to choose your blog niche or topics, and will talk about the 8 most profitable niches to consider, based on current trends and forecasts for 2022 and beyond. These are the best blog niches that make money.

Things to Consider and Research Before You Start Your Blogging Career

In this video, I will not even mention choosing any technical or design elements, marketing, or other content-related tasks.  I will focus on the steps leading up to a topic decision.

1. Explore Your Interests and Expertise
It is important to choose a topic for your blog that you are passionate about, or at least interested in, or it can become very tedious very quickly.  My advice is to explore the intersection of your interests or expertise, hobbies, past experiences, and so on, with trending topics or what might interest others.  Find a problem to solve or a unique voice to provide, and you’ll be on the right track to focusing in on a good popular blog topic.  

2. Monetization
When thinking about blog topics that will you make money, you need to give some thought to your method(s) of monetization.  How are you going to turn visits to your blog and pageviews into a source of income?  Popular options include advertising, affiliate or referral programs, making and selling your own products or services, and alternative support methods, such as Patreon.  Why you need consider this in the context of blog niche ideas?  Well, it’s because the best monetization methods are different for different niches. For example, with a food blog or a home décor blog, the easiest way to start making money would be with ads. That’s possible because you will be able to get a lot of traffic in some niches, for example, from Pinterest. 
In other more narrow or business-related topics, you will not ever get as much traffic and it making money with ads on such topics doesn’t make much sense when you can offer high-ticket affiliate products or sell your own services or digital products. 

3. Competition
You likely will want to come up with a few blog niche ideas when you brainstorm, and then research each one.  It’s vital that you spend some time doing keyword research and looking at your competition.  How will you differentiate yourself?  Some of the most profitable blogging niches have a lot of competition in them already, and if you don’t bring something unique to the table, you may not be successful.  That’s why we stress again it is possible that an extremely niche blog, with limited competition, that otherwise doesn’t appear on our most profitable blog niche list below, may  in fact be the best choice for you.  Do your research!

Trump: US must condemn white supremacy - BBC News,"President Donald Trump has condemned ""racism, hatred and white supremacy"" in an address following mass shootings that left 29 dead in Texas and Ohio.

He called for mental health gun control reforms, an end to the glorification of violence in society and the death penalty for those behind the shootings.

""Mental health and hate pull the trigger, not the gun,"" Mr Trump said, speaking at the White House on Monday.

He did not express support for gun control measures proposed in Congress.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

School Facts That Flunked the Test of Time,"Did you know that some stuff we learned in school isn't exactly on point? Like, remember when they told us you could drink water from a cactus in a survival situation? Turns out, that's more of a Hollywood thing than reality - most cacti have toxic fluids that can make you sick. And what about Pluto being the ninth planet? Nope, it got downgraded to a ""dwarf planet"" back in 2006. Oh, and don't get me started on how they used to teach that dinosaurs were cold-blooded - turns out, some of them might've been warm-blooded like modern birds! It's wild how science keeps evolving and uncovering new truths.

The amateur sleuth: What happened to Olivia Lone Bear? -BBC News,"In late October 2017, 32-year-old Olivia Lone Bear disappeared from New Town, North Dakota.

Her family started posting on Facebook, asking if anyone had seen her. Then, they went to the police.

According to Matthew Lone Bear, that’s “where the issues already started”.

Law and order is handled differently on tribal land than the rest of the United States. The BBC’s Colleen Hagerty looks at  how families of missing Native Americans are turning to social media to aid their searches.

New Zealand (or Aotearoa) is marking the anniversary in a big way, but Maori activist Tina Ngata says there is little to celebrate.

She says Maori people are disproportionately poor, in jail and discriminated against, and that this all has its roots in New Zealand's colonial past.

A severed head was lobbed into a polling station and five workers were killed on the eve of the vote.

Early results suggest President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Morena party and its allies will keep a majority in the lower house, but fall short of the two-thirds needed to approve major changes.

Many voters say the president failed to boost the economy and curb crime.

Mexican Street Food!! 🥓 Giant BACON WRAPPED BURRITO + Tostilocos!!,"🥩 Carne Asada Tour: https://youtu.be/4FTSW08mDN4
🔔 SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe Don’t miss new food videos!

TUCSON, ARIZONA - Tucson, Arizona is one of the great Mexican food cities of the United States, especially for Sonoran Mexican food. Today, we’re going to a place that specializes in a huge burrito, filled with grilled steak, and fully wrapped in bacon! Delicious, or too much? Let’s go try it!

📍 Percheron Mexican Grill (https://g.page/percheronmexicangrill?share) Price - About $12 per burrito - Percheron Mexican Grill is known for their percheron, a type of giant burrito that’s known from Hermosillo which includes a huge flour tortilla filled with carne asada, cheese, and avocado. But at Tucson’s Percheron Mexican Grill, they take the percheron to the next level by wrapping it in bacon fully, and searing off the bacon on a hot griddle before you’re served. At first, I was thinking it might be over the top, and just too much of a good thing. But taking my first bite, I knew it wasn’t hype, it’s the real deal. Somehow the bacon isn’t overpowering or even too rich, it just provides the ultimate burrito wrapping. Incredibly tasty, a must when you’re in Tucson, Arizona.

📍 Elotes el Fridas (https://goo.gl/maps/8rMKThWMaaurdFDA9) - Price - $5 - Next up on this Mexican street food tour in Tucson, Carlos and I headed over to Elotes el Fridas to eat elotes, corn on the cob dressed in Mexican cream, mayo, and cheese, with self seasoning of salsas. It was great, the corn was sweet and delicious.

📍 Marymar Raspados (https://goo.gl/maps/wLyeQdCjR2oUUJ8L8) - Finally to finish off this Mexican food tour of Tucson, we headed over to Marymar Raspados to eat a variety of fruits and drinks, super sweet and dressed in chamoy. It was a great sweet way to end this amazing day of bacon wrapped burritos in Tucson!

Why Asians Always Wear Masks,"If you’ve ever been to any East Asian countries or seen them in pictures or TV shows, you probably noticed hundreds of people wearing surgical masks. They wear them in public transport, cafes, in the street, and in the office. In Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam, medical face masks have long ago become part of everyday life. Even babies wear them all the time.
 
It looks like the most obvious reason would be to not catch a cold. Well, technically, it all started with that. Wearing a mask gives minimal protection from germs, though it’s the opinion of some that viruses have no difficulty getting through them. But there are other reasons.

#Asia #Japan #brightside

SUMMARY:
- When you’re sick, you’re constantly leaving a trail of germs that stay behind wherever you go: on seats in public transport, doors, and hand-rails. That’s why wearing a mask is a social courtesy.
- Another reason is air pollution. If you ride a scooter, and there are millions of them in Vietnam and China, you’ll want a mask. 
- Masks are also effective against allergies. The end of February is the beginning of allergy season for people in Japan.
- In those Asian countries where winters can be cold and frosty, masks can also help to protect the face. 
- Asians wear masks so often that they’ve long ago become part of their wardrobe. Young people try to pick out a mask color and shape to match their outfit. 
- The Asian masks market is thriving, they spend $230,000,000 on masks yearly in Japan alone. 
- Asia is the biggest continent in square miles and population. It’s bigger than the entire surface of the moon by 2.9 million square miles.
- Though China is in 5 time zones, there’s officially only one that they use. 
- The Vietnamese New year, Tet, is a birthday for everyone. It starts on the first day of the Moon calendar, which is at the end of winter, and is celebrated for several days.
- The Thai New Year is celebrated from April 13 till April 15, and is the oldest festival that marks the change of seasons. 
- The Japanese are the thinnest nation among the largest economies. And this is regulated by law! Japanese laws demand that men’s waist shouldn’t be wider than 33.5 inches. Women’s waists shouldn’t be wider than 35 inches.
- In Vietnam, men grow long fingernails. It’s considered a high-class mark, since only people who don’t do any hard work can manage this. 
- “Inemuri” is the Japanese practice of taking a nap during the workday. If you go to sleep in the office, nobody will judge or fire you.
- The famous Japanese dish, “sushi” originated from South Asia and is made from 2 main ingredients of Eastern cuisine – rice and fish.

Japanese cherry blossom festival hit by Covid restrictions - BBC News,"Japan's cherry trees began their annual bloom nearly two weeks ahead of schedule. Cherry blossom - also known as Sakura - is the country's national flower.

This year coronavirus restrictions mean that people are not allowed to get together for family picnics and tourists are not able to fly to the country to see the blossom.

People from all over the country normally come together to celebrate by visiting parks and throwing big picnics called hanami, and eating special blossom-themed food.

China says Indian troops fired 'provocative' shots in border dispute - BBC News,"China has accused Indian troops of illegally crossing a disputed Himalayan border and firing ""provocative"" warning shots at patrolling soldiers.

China's military said its soldiers were ""forced to take countermeasures"", though it is not clear what they were.

India rejected the allegations and accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during the face-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region.

Relations between the countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months.

India said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had tried to approach a forward Indian position near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and ""fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate [our] own troops"".

Lana Del Rey - Music To Watch Boys To (Lyrics)

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

George Floyd killer Derek Chauvin asks for new trial - BBC News,"The former Minneapolis police officer convicted last month of the murder of George Floyd has requested a new trial.

Derek Chauvin's legal team have filed court documents alleging misconduct by both prosecutors and jurors.

Chauvin, who was captured on video kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter.

His lawyer said his client was deprived of a fair trial. US media report that the request for a new trial was expected and is a common move following a conviction.

Delaying Pregnancy and Parenthood: The Risks and Rewards | The Forum at HSPH,"In a new report, the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC has confirmed that the average age at which American women deliver their first babies has increased in the last 40 years. The Center reports that there were more than nine times as many first births to women 35 years old or older in 2012 than there were four decades earlier. Juxtaposed to this trend is a decrease in the last decade in first birth rates for women younger than 30 years old. This Forum examined the societal and technological factors driving delayed pregnancy, including fertility treatments; delved into the health risks to older mothers and their babies; and explored both the risks and the benefits to older parenthood.

Presented May 21, 2014 in Collaboration with PRI's The World and WGBH

23 MINIATURE CRAFTS AND DIY IDEAS YOU NEED IN YOUR LIFE,"DO NOT TRY THE KNIFE TRICK WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION

ADORABLE MINIATURE CRAFTS NOBODY CAN RESIST

In the first video I show you how to use a piece of blade to make your own mini knife. You’ll need to print a miniature cut out to stick on the blade and then follow my tutorial on how to make it. You can use it while doing some miniature foods or when you can try some crafts with polymer clay. 
Speaking of, I show you a way to make your own USB container using polymer clay. It can resemble a donut or a cupcake. Before you bake it, place your USB inside to make it fit perfectly, then remove it to bake and voila. Using the same method, I show you how to create a carrot-shaped plug for your phone which prevents dust from getting in. 
I also show you how to make adorable mini decorations for your garden. You can take a plastic bottle, carve some windows and a door on it and then decorate it with little rocks. You can add artificial candles inside and plant little trees around it on a plant pot. 
I also make a miniature demonstration to show you how houses are built. 

Timestamps:
0:07 – Adorable miniature knife

How Far
Lyrics:

How far is too far
I thought I’d be there by now
I followed shame to the place 
I was sure Your grace ran out

So I kept running and running and running
But You kept chasing and chasing and chasing

A million miles of my mistakes
Still couldn’t keep Your love away
However far away I am from home
That’s how far Your love will go 

I turn around and I see 
Pure compassion in Your eyes
A Savior’s voice says to me
“Time to come back home, my child”

I came running and running and running
And You kept reaching and reaching and reaching, Lord

A million miles of my mistakes
Still couldn't keep Your love away
However far away I am from home
That’s how far Your love will go

Mercy’s arms stretched open wide
You paid it all
What kind of love lays down His life?
Willing to cross…

A million miles of my mistakes
Still couldn’t keep Your love away
However far away I am from home
That’s how far Your love will go

Oh I couldn’t keep Your love away
However far away I am from home
That’s how far Your love will go
How far Your love will go

Arms stretched open wide
That’s how far Your love will go 

(How far Your love will go
How far Your love will go)

That’s how far Your love will go

Russian forces withdraw from key Ukrainian city Kharkiv - BBC News,"Ukraine has ""likely won the battle of Kharkiv"", according to think-tank the Institute for the Study of War.

Military analysts say Russia was prevented from encircling Ukraine's second city - and has now given up on attempts to do so.

Since the start of the invasion, capturing it has been a key strategic aim of Russian forces.

""There was no shelling in the city for the last five days,"" the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, told the BBC.

""Now it is calm in Kharkiv and people are gradually coming back to the city.""

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

SUMMARY:
- On August, 18, 2008 Bitcoin.org was anonymously registered. Just 2 months later Nakamoto published a white paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, explaining the whole idea behind the bitcoin.
- In October 2009 bitcoin exchange rate was finally revealed – 1 dollar equalled 1.309 bitcoins.
- By the beginning of 2011 1 bitcoin was worth 1 dollar. With all the buzz around it 4 months later it was already 31 dollars against 1 bitcoin.
- In April of 2013 it hit the new height of 266 dollars. In November of the same year 1 bitcoin went up to 1.242 dollars!
- By the beginning of 2018, its price beat all the records going all the way up to mind-blowing 13.000 dollars! 
- Some countries aren't fans of cryptocurrency as well, including the US. In 2018 the US Securities and Exchange Commission made it clear that the operators of 2 initial coin offerings must pay fines and restitution.
- Analysts also have another theory for bitcoin fall – the division within the cryptocurrency community. 
- NEO reached its all-time peak back in 2017 when it valued about 162 dollars. Today, however, it equals only a little bit over 9 dollars for one token. 
- Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency that first came to market in 2014. It's highly private, safe, and leaves no trace whatsoever.
- Litecoin was created back in 2011 by a former Google engineer Charlie Lee. It's one of the first cryptocurrencies launched and is even called a “silver to bitcoin's gold!”
- Dash or as it often called darkcoin was developed in 2014 by Evan Duffield. It's basically a more private version of popular bitcoin. 
- Ethereum is a whole platform run on its own unique token called ether. The pre-sales for ethers were launched in 2014 and the platform itself started working in 2015. 
- Bitcoin advocates say that the number of things you can buy with cryptocurrency grows faster and faster. 
- Government regulations of cryptocurrency are very important. The more countries accept it, the more comfortable cryptocurrency investors feel! 
- Some specialists say that bitcoins can lay a great basis for countries with weak national currency, especially considering the fact that nobody has direct control over their price.

Lyrics:
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 

You were the manna in my desert 
Desert 
You’ve been a fountain on the days 
My faith was dry 
And You’ll be my lily in the valley 
Valley 
Why would I doubt 
When You are the God that still provides 

You were the ram for every Isaac 
Isaac 
And You’ve been my shepherd  
When I left the ninety-nine 
You’ll be beside me in the fire 
The fire 
So why would I doubt 
When You always show up 
Just in time 

The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The evidence is all around 
That the miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
Your promise is You don’t ever let Your kids down 
No, You never let Your kids down 

We’ll see the prodigal returning 
They’re returning 
And we’ll see a marriage on the rocks 
Come back to life 
And we’ll see the barren hold their babies 
Their babies 
Impossible things  
We’re gonna see with our own eyes  

‘Cause the miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The evidence is all around 
That the miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
Your promise is You don’t ever let Your kids down 
No 
No, You never let Your kids down 
Never 
Never 
Never, no 

When You say You’ll show up 
You show up 
When You say You’ll come through 
You always do 
If You did it back then 
You can do it now 
‘Cause You don’t ever let Your kids down   

And they call You a healer 
‘Cause You keep healing
They call You a savior 
‘Cause You keep saving 
If You did it back then 
You can do it now 
‘Cause You don’t ever let Your kids down 

When You say You’ll show up 
You show up 
When You say You’ll come through 
You always do 
If You did it back then 
You can do it now 
‘Cause You don’t ever let Your kids down  

And they call You a healer 
‘Cause You keep healing 
They call You a savior 
‘Cause You keep saving 
If You did it back then 
You can do it now 
‘Cause You don’t ever let Your kids down 

The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The evidence is all around 
That the miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle now 
The miracle worker’s working a miracle out 
Your promise is You don’t ever let Your kids down 
No, You never let Your kids down 
You never let Your kids down 
You never let Your kids down 
You don’t ever let Your kids down

"Turkish Food Tour in Istanbul - BEST Kebabs of My Life, AMAZING Seafood, and Turkish Ice Cream!","►Check out my Istanbul Travel Food Guide: https://goo.gl/gRsk6W
►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Camera gear I use: https://goo.gl/Vky1ke

The first thing we did in the morning in Istanbul was drive over to Beşiktaş to eat an amazing Turkish food breakfast at a restaurant called Çakmak Kahvaltı Salonu. From there we took the ferry across the Bosphorus to Kadiköy, where we had an incredible Turkish seafood meal for lunch. Finally, we enjoyed some Turkish ice cream, and the show, and had the most incredible kebab I’ve ever had in my life at Zübeyir Ocakbaşı Restaurant. It was an amazing day of Turkish food in Istanbul!

1:27 Turkish breakfast at Çakmak Kahvaltı Salonu - For breakfast we headed to Beşiktaş, one of my favorite areas of Istanbul, and went to a restaurant known for serving breakfast. The breakfast was amazing, and I ate a dish of eggs with beef and butter. The side dishes were also fantastic. Total price - 29 TL ($9.73)

7:40 Boat to Kadiköy and Kadiköy Market - During our trip so far to Istanbul, we hadn’t had a chance to go to the Asian side of Istanbul. So today, we took the ferry over to Kadiköy pier on the Asian side across the Bosphorus. The views of Istanbul from the Bosphorus were stunning. On the other side, the main thing I wanted to do was explore Kadiköy Market, which was every bit as colorful as I had imagined. The fresh vegetables and seafood were fantastic, and I tried a cup of pickle juice.

1 Week Ago in Mumbai: https://goo.gl/mK6rGs

12:45 Seafood lunch at Balıkçı Lokantası Restaurant - Of all the meals I ate in Istanbul, this was one of my personal favorites, being a seafood lover. Not a far walk from the market, we went to a local family run seafood restaurant called Balıkçı Lokantası Restaurant. The owners were really friendly, and I ordered a plate of hamsi (which are anchovies), and I’m not sure of the name of the other dish, but I got Black Sea salmon braised in olive oil and butter I think with herbs and spices. It was one of the best Turkish foods I ate the entire trip to Istanbul. Wow, it was amazing.

20:50 Turkish Ice Cream - After spending some time exploring the Asian side of Istanbul, we took the ferry back to the European side, and since Istiklal Street was on our route, we stopped to have Turkish ice cream. You also see Turkish ice cream vendors playing with their customers, but when you’re the victim, it’s so confusing and funny. They have some serious skills playing with Turkish ice cream. Do you like Turkish ice cream?

23:49 Zübeyir Ocakbaşı Restaurant - For our final Turkish food meal of the day, we headed over to Zübeyir Ocakbaşı Restaurant. Ocakbaşı is a type of Turkish grill, and they served all sorts of different meat included kebabs and lamb chops in particular. We also got a bunch of side dishes and they cooked the kebabs and lamb chops right in front of us within the center of the restaurant. The kebab was the best I’ve ever had in my mouth, with an amazing mixture of minced meat and spices. Total price - 100 TL ($33.55). Thank you to David from http://beygale.co.il/ for the recommendation.

Lauren Spencer Smith - Flowers (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Lauren Spencer Smith - Flowers - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023 

Sometimes simpler is better. “My name is Lauren Spencer Smith, and I write songs about boys for your enjoyment.” That's how the Spotify page of the young Canadian singer behind “Fingers Crossed” describes her current job. It’s a true statement, but she’s left out a few elements. Like how well those songs are crafted, and how affecting her music can be. Tracks such as “Narcissist” and “Flowers” have raised goosebumps on the necks of numerous Smith fans - a growth demo for sure. “Young people fall for the wrong people, I guess my one was you,” she sings on the latter. Heartbreak is Smith's strong suit. The Vancouver Island teen, who made it to the Top 20 on ‘American Idol’ two years ago after wowing Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and (especially) Luke Bryan, has a gift when it comes to communicating emotional pain. That’s why “Fingers Crossed” took a wild ride on TikTok and hit the top of the iTunes chart the week after it was released. Listeners connect quickly to her work. Her 2019 Juno Award-nominated ‘Unplugged, Vol. 1’ proved that. Smith has said that a pal she met during her ‘Idol’ run helped tighten her writing skills. Now Smith’s process is architectural. She starts with a concept and moves into the specifics of the tale being told – what happened, how it felt, which instruments would communicate the story best. Wise, right? Craft is important. With her debut album on its way, and newly arrived holiday track “Single on The 25th,” a broader picture of her skills will be here soon enough. And by the way, Smith’s not all boo-hoo ballads; she’s promised that several of the new tracks are up-tempo pop. Her Artists To Watch performance of “Fingers Crossed” is as powerful as you’d expect.

Thai Street Food of Your Dreams in Bangkok (ร้าน หน่องริมคลอง) - Giant Pad Kee Mao Crab!,"►Subscribe for more food videos! http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Details about how you can eat here and a map on the blog post: https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-street-food-dreams/
►Camera gear I use: https://goo.gl/mKNy7K

Nhong Rim Klong (ร้าน หน่องริมคลอง) is a street food stall in Bangkok that serves impressive Thai street food!

Located on Ekkamai Soi 21, Nhong Rim Klong (ร้าน หน่องริมคลอง) is a restaurant that’s been shared quite a lot recently on Thai social media — and rightfully so, because the food looked absolutely sensational. So one day for lunch my wife and I decided to go check it out.

The street food stall is located along the canal, the kitchen is literally over the top of the canal on the bridge, and then tables of seating are down the left hand side of the canal. Although it’s not the cleanest of canals, the amazing Thai food is what you come here for.

Tom yum seafood (ต้มยำทะเลน้ำใส) - We started off with Thai tom yum with seafood, the clear version of the soup. It was packed with a mix of seafood including squid, shrimp, and fish, and the broth was so seafoody and sour. It was amazing. Price - 200 THB.

Fried shrimp with garlic (กุ้งทอดกระเทียม) - Fried shrimp with garlic is a classic Thai street food dish, and the shrimp were meaty and firm, and were embedded with a deep fried garlic taste. Price - 200 THB

Cabbage fried with fish sauce and crab meat (กะหล่ำผัดน้ำปลาเนื้อปู) - One of the signature dishes at Nhong Rim Klong (ร้าน หน่องริมคลอง) is fried cabbage with a mixture of crab and shrimp and egg all over the top. It was so rich and creamy and a very comforting dish. Price - 200 THB.

Pad kee mao crab (ผัดขี้เมาปู) - Finally the last dish Ying and I ordered was pad kee mao crab, which is stir fried drunken style crab. This was the best Thai dish at Nhong Rim Klong (ร้าน หน่องริมคลอง) for me. The dish included crab, long beans, fingerroot, chilies, garlic, onions, kaffir lime leaves, eggplant, and basil. It was sensation! Price -  300 THB.

This is not a cheap Thai street food stall, but for the ingredients and dishes they serve, it’s well worth it for a serious Bangkok street food treat.

28 SECRET DIY JEWELRY PROJECTS || HOW TO MAKE JEWELRY AT HOME,"BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY CRAFTS USING WEIRD OBJECTS

A piece of Jewelry gives a very different feel to our outfits. They make them stand out more and appear more stylish. In this video I show you how to make easy earrings, bracelets and necklaces from scratch without spending a penny. 
Buying an amethyst crystal is quite pricy, but in this video I show you how to make your own using water, salt and some purple food coloring.
You can take a plastic bottle and use it to make a beautiful sweater bracelets from your old clothes. 
I also show you how to make bohemian-inspired earrings using ribbons. You simple remove on of the threads to let the ribbon become fluffier (with multiple hairs) and then you attach it to some old jewelry bits. 
Another easy DIY jewelry idea is to repurpose old wine corks and turn them into geometric earrings by coloring them and then cutting them.
For parties or a more colorful and casual look, you can use some hot glue, glitter and some paper clips that form a triangle. You simply add the glue inside the paper clips and then you sprinkle your desired colored glitter on top. 
Stay tuned until the end to see how to use resin and how to make jewelry out of pasta.

While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rRF4K4Mle4
Bru-C - Playground (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Bru-C - Playground (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Thanks to Beyoncé and Drake releasing projects that heavily draw from dance music, the public’s consequent heightened interest in the genre can only be a good thing for Bru-C. With origins as a rave promoter, the Nottingham MC lives and breaths the UK club scene - considered by many as the Garden of Eden of dance music. For many these sweaty dance floors are escape routes from the hardships of real life; Josh Bruce was no exception. “It’s important for me as a young, mixed-race lad from the Midlands to just be transparent,” he says about the “thoughtful edge” to his party tracks like “Paradise” and “No Excuses.” Specifically, Bruce/Bru-C (he says he can’t separate himself from his artist moniker) has been celebrated for leading the resurgence in bassline - a cultural subgenre of UK garage. His biggest streaming hit post-COVID “Streetside” led crowds back to the dance floors following lockdown. Latest track “Playground” kicks off with hyper drum ‘n’ bass percussion. In it Bru-C’s vocals act as a gravitational force, dictating ebbs and flows of energy. “This is England, the kingdom/The world is ours,” he smoothly declares. Confidence on Drake and Beyoncé levels, with beats to match.

"Journey to Mars Update on This Week @NASA – September 30, 2016","NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden joined other leaders of the world’s space agencies to discuss the latest technological breakthroughs and developments in space exploration at the 67th International Astronautical Congress, Sept. 26-30th in Guadalajara, Mexico.
At the event, NASA discussed new elements to its multi-phase Journey to Mars to extend the human footprint all the way to the Red Planet. NASA will continue operations aboard the International Space Station through 2024. Work currently underway aboard the station to encourage commercial development of low-Earth orbit, develop deep space systems, life support and human health is part of the Earth Reliant phase of the Journey to Mars. In the 2020s, during the Proving Ground phase when NASA steps out farther, the agency now plans to send an astronaut crew on a yearlong mission to a deep space destination near the moon. They will conduct activities to verify habitation and test our readiness for Mars. A round-trip robotic Mars sample return mission is being targeted for the 2020s, as part of the Earth Independent phase before finally sending humans on a mission to orbit Mars in the early 2030s. Also, Zurbuchen Named Head of NASA Science, Hubble Spots Possible Water Plumes on Europa, Rosetta’s Mission Ends, and Armstrong Celebrates 70 Years of Flight Research!",Science & Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rsyyWQcGMg

Me On Your Mind

I’ve read the words in red
How you leave the ninety-nine
To find the one missing
Feels like that was written 
With me on your mind

And the prodigal son who ran 
Leaving the his home behind
The part where the father
Came running to meet him
Did you say that with me on your mind

Who am I that the king of the world 
Would give one single thought about my broken heart
Who am I that the God of all grace
Wipes the tears from my face and says come as you are
You paid the price
You took the cross
You gave your life
And you did it all
With me on your mind

Just knowing you’re mindful of me
Just knowing you call me your child
It’s flooding my soul
With unspeakable hope   
Thank you Lord that it’s me on your mind

I’ve read the words in red
Of a heavenly home on high
You’re preparing a place where the sorrow’s erased
And when I stand before you I’ll find
All along it was me on your mind
All along it was me on your mind

"8 Things That Started Out Uncool, But Now Rule the World","It's hard to imagine our lives without the social media these days, but did you know it was invented back in the 17th century Netherlands? People would carry an “album amicorum” or “friendship book” and exchange these books at significant events, writing down jokes and riddles, sharing notes and stories. As you approach a vending machine to get some of your favorite candy, you’ll be surprised to know that this complicated device has been used in human history for hundreds of years. Through many civilizations around the world, each managed to develop a similar useful invention: the toilet. Understandably, variations have been used as far back as 5 thousand years.

"Put Garlic in the Toilet Before Going to Bed, See What Happens","If you're looking for a natural and affordable solution to keep your toilet odor-free, garlic can help! Freshly crushed garlic cloves contain a variety of antimicrobial properties. Allicin in it reduces the build-up of bacteria and fungi. Hair, grease, and grime build up over time and eventually clog the drains, removing the blockage is easy with salt and vinegar. Scorched pans tend to use a lot of elbow grease, but they can be cleaned a lot easier with the right ingredients.

Egypt 10 years after the revolution - BBC News,"It's been 10 years since Egyptians took to the streets to unseat their longest-serving President, Hosni Mubarak. Their uprising was part of a movement of pro-democracy protests in the Arab world to end autocratic rule.

Although Mubarak left power, many believe the dreams of a democratic Egypt, have yet to be achieved.

Human rights groups repeatedly criticise severe restrictions imposed on freedom of expression under Egypt’s current President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. But the authorities and his supporters say that Mr Sisi is protecting the country from chaos.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

South Sudan: Responding to the Worst Floods in Decades,"Eight months since the flooding began, people in Unity State, northern South Sudan, continue to suffer, stuck in poor living conditions and are at risk for outbreaks of infectious and waterborne diseases. Spread across several makeshift camp sites, they face food insecurity, loss of income, malnutrition, and a lack of safe drinking water. An estimated 835,000 people have been affected, according to the United Nations. The UN reports that this is the worst flooding emergency in decades.  

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are running mobile clinics that visit camps in and around the Mayom region, Bentiu, and Rubkona, responding to malaria, malnutrition, and acute watery diarrhea. “Many people have been displaced, and they are squeezed to one area,” said mobile clinic team leader Sworo Scopas Duku. “There are many diarrhea cases and we think that is because they have a lack of clean water to drink.” To try and reduce the spread of disease, MSF teams built a sewage treatment plant in six days.

Into The Glass (Lyrics)

VERSE 1
You stop when the car leaves the drive
I’m not coming home tonight
I’m not coming home tonight
I won’t stop
Hard left into the night
You thought I’d be home tonight. 

Na ah 
No. 
Yeah?
No. 

BRIDGE
And you feel it
In the edges of your spine.
You hear it
In the corner of your mind.
You fear that
The world’s left you behind.
I know I know 
It hurts to come home
The lights are on but you’re alone. 

Oh oh oh ayeoh

CHORUS 1
Both arms around your neck
The arguments
The things we said. 
Both arms around your neck
The arguments
The things we said. 

VERSE 2
I never felt
Like I’m more alive
I’m not coming home tonight
I’m not coming home tonight
‘Cause it took me this long
To realise
That it’s been a waste of time
I’m gunna give up the fight
And you feel it
In the edges of your spine.
You hear it
In the corner of your mind.
You fear that
The world’s left you behind.
I know I know 
It hurts to come home
The lights are on but you’re alone. 

No oh oh oh ayeoh
Oh oh oh yeah

CHORUS 2
I’m running from a world of sadness
I’m running from a world of greed
Nothing but a thief ‘cause baby
You took the best of me
I’m running from a world of sadness
I’m running from a world of greed
Nothing but a thief ‘cause baby
You took the best of me

And you scream out
Oh you scream out
And you scream out
You scream out
And you scream out

Middle 8
I’m running from a world of sadness
I’m running from a world of greed
Nothing but a thief ‘cause baby
You took the best of me

OUTRO
Both arms around your neck
The arguments
The things we said.
All the things we said
Both arms around your neck
The arguments
The things we said.
All the things we said
Both arms around your neck
The arguments
The things we said.
All the things we said

30 TRUE RELATIONSHIP STORIES YOU CAN DEFINITELY RELATE TO,"HOW RELATIONSHIPS DIFFER THROUGH TIME

Relationships tend to differ through time and we prepared a video with hilarious scenes that describe how relationships change after the first date. The first year of relationships differ so much from long-term relationships and every couple knows it. The first-year is full of drama! Scandals are every day as it’s really hard to live together. But remember that frequent conflicts may indicate that all is not well. You should work hard to create healthy relationships. During the first year of dating ladies are incredibly jealous. After years you trust your partner. Always take care of your partner and help with home life-work. Remember that even after years of marriage, you can be perfectly happy with your partner and still be attracted to others.
One more funny compilation is about the difference between your relationships while the first date and a year after. The main difference is that partners are usually not confident and try to look as good as possible. During the first year of dating ladies prefer to look as sexy as possible and wear high heels, sexy and uncomfortable dresses. But a year later everything changes and we share a funny selection of relationship changer after a year of dating. Girls usually pretend that they only eat one salad per day and beauty routine takes hours to look the best way possible. Girls are afraid that boyfriend will see them without makeup in the morning and shave legs every day.

"Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains ""What Goes Up, Must Come Down""","What goes up, must come down…right? Neil deGrasse Tyson says not so fast. You’ve heard the phrase before but Neil and comic co-host Chuck Nice are here to provide an update to this classic phrase in the latest StarTalk explainer video. 

To start, we take a look at the science behind the phrase. You’ll learn about the forces of gravity working all around us. Then, Neil and Chuck discuss why it’s time to retire the phrase, or, make it a little more scientific. 

We explore escape velocity. Discover more about traveling to the Moon and Mars and why we don’t pack fuel to get to the final destination, we just pack fuel to get to a certain point along the way. All that, plus, Neil and Chuck provide an updated version of “what goes up, must come down.”

About the prints that flank Neil in this video:

""Black Swan” & ""White Swan"" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston. For more information about this artist and her work, visit Inuit Gallery of Vancouver https://inuit.com/.

Pol Granch - No Pegamos (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Pol Granch - No Pegamos (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Pop music often rewards artists who address its blank canvas by using every tool at their disposal. Big payoffs look a lot like Pol Granch, whose greatest strength is versatility. His music ruptures the mutual exclusion of adjectives like melancholy and sunny, unconventional and familiar, style and substance, heck, even French and Spanish. All the above snuggled together like puzzle pieces on last year's ‘Tengo Que Calmarme,’ the self-taught musician’s debut album. Granch has likened ‘Calmarme’ to a search for “musical maturity.” And he's right: here are 13 catchy alt-leaning pop tracks that experiment wisely and reap rewards. More recently, he takes a big chance on “De Colegio” by trading a sparkling dance backbeat for a menacing moment in the bridge. He’s also taking chances as an actor this year, and was recently cast as a lead on Netflix’s popular show ‘Elite.’ Follow his current moves - including these “De Colegio” and “No Pegamos” DSCVR performances - and you can’t help but feel like you’re watching a star being born in front of your eyes.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s 

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

Thousands take part in Māori protests in New Zealand's capital | BBC News,"More than 40,000 people have protested outside New Zealand’s parliament against a proposed bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding document between British colonisers and Māori people.
 
Tuesday's demonstration marked the end of a nine-day hīkoi, or peaceful protest, that had made its way through the country.
 
The hīkoi swelled to one of the biggest in the country's history, with many participants draped in colours of the Māori flag, as they marched through the capital Wellington.

"""The war in Sudan NEEDS our attention"": Refugees in Eastern Chad","Imagine one latrine for every 600+ people.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) USA executive director, Avril Benoît, just returned from eastern #Chad, where hundreds of thousands of refugees struggle to meet their most basic needs. Her message: “The war in Sudan NEEDS our attention.”

THE 30 MOST USEFUL LIFE HACKS EVER,"HOW TOs FOR EVERY DAY

Cooking is really fun if you know smart ways to do it! This time I wanna help you make cooking fun! 
Let's start with some potato chips hacks. Did you know you could start a fire with chips in case of emergency cold weather? 
If you don't want to get dirty salty hands and want to get that last chip still, just take your scissors and cut an edge of the chips' bag. Or you can use chopsticks!
If you don't want to spill your coffee just take Springles' cap and cover the coffee cup with it!
Don't forget to check how to make giant chip you can eat for the whole month!
It sounds funny but most people don't know how to eat certain food properly! No worries, I'll tell you how:
When you open a Cola can, turn little opener towards you, this small hole inside is specially made for sticking your straw comfortably!
Fold pizza slice in half so nothing would fall off.
Hold a wine glass by the stem, not by the bowl!
If you want to store cut apples in a plastic bag you should suck out oxygen with a straw!
Tear a sugar packet in the center not on the side.
If you wanna cut a baguette correctly, turn it upside down.
Stir sugar in the cup to and fro, not in the circular movements.
And if you wanna pour milk to cereal bowl, don't pour it directly to the bowl, pour it on the spoon!

What If You Surfed the Biggest Tsunami Wave,"What's the biggest wave ever surfed? Imagine a 10-story-high wall of water with a foamy-white peak smashing into the shore. That’s the mental image we all have when we think of tsunamis, but is it accurate? And if it is, why don’t daredevil surfers ride them? That’s a huge wave begging to be caught! Fear of heights? Top speeds? Because they choose life? But they’re supposed to be daredevils! 

Seriously, where would anyone get the idea to surf a tsunami? Movies! All those disaster flicks depicting tsunamis as monstrous waves. Realistically, the difference between tsunamis and surfing waves is as ridiculously huge as that movie wave about to take out that skyscraper. You CAN surf on a massive wave. As long as it’s the right kind. And that surfable kind can even be bigger than tsunamis! So, what is the difference between this “right” kind of wave and tsunamis?

"Trump could be impeached: how did we get here? - BBC News","The US House of Representatives is preparing to vote to possibly impeach President Donald Trump.


Mr Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.

A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September.

A rough transcript of the call revealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden.

President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing.

PM loses key vote on Brexit - BBC News,"Boris Johnson loses key Brexit vote as MPs opposed to no deal take

Tory rebels and opposition MPs have defeated the government in the first stage of their attempt to pass a law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

In a huge blow to Boris Johnson, the Commons voted 328 to 301 to take control of the agenda, meaning they can bring forward a bill seeking to delay the UK's exit date beyond 31 October.

Afraid of Covid-19 and with barely any PPE available, most doctors fled - leaving Dr Zoha as the only doctor left in the city willing to treat Covid patients.

Nearly six months since the virus spread in Yemen, the BBC is the first international broadcaster to reach the country to see how people are dealing with the pandemic.

Corbyn: Johnson over-estimates himself - BBC News,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says ""no one underestimates this country"", but it is ""deeply worried that the new prime minister over-estimates himself"".

He says the country has been ""held back"" by nine years of austerity, and opportunity and freedom have been ""taken away"".

Cuts to government spending, he says, were a ""political choice"", not an ""economic necessity"".

Many of them go out of Vietnam via China. But when they reach the English Channel the only reliable way across is by being smuggled inside containers, regardless of what fee is paid.

In the aftermath of the tragedy in Essex, the Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has ordered an investigation into trafficking networks. But trafficking has long been a serious problem, often involving women and children. This year the country was downgraded in the annual US State Department's Trafficking in Persons report.",News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61s4u2KjKDQ

ScarLip - Blick (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2024,"ScarLip - Blick | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024

In a hip-hop landscape littered with copycats and swagger jackers, ScarLip is blazing her own trail. The New York native wields her words like a machete, slashing a gash in the Big Apple’s drill scene and connecting it back to the city’s past as a bastion of worldview altering lyricism. Check “No Statements.” Nothing sounds quite like its two minute and 38-seconds of snarled “mmm’s” which are both insidiously secretive and a smart meta self-censor. If that track unceremoniously drops you on your ass right into the Bronx streets, then “This Is New York” will make your faint heart want to scramble home. The rhymer born Sierra Lewis leans into intimidation. If you’re not built to be around her, “go to PA with that shit,” she wryly intones. And that’s just one layer of the ScarLip experience. What really caught our team’s eye when we were combing through hip-hop’s depthless pool of young talent were the pinned videos on her Instagram. Channeling the spoken word side of the genre, she bares her soul to the camera as she recounts her life story, including growing up in foster care and the violence that begat to her namesake. These raw testimonials - delivered in deft measure, to note - earned her huge cred in rap circles, and has led to co-signs from Snoop, Swiss Beats, and Cardi B among other luminaries. “I feel like I’m on fire when I’m performing,” she told us. It sure looked like it. The team couldn’t get over the energy she brought to “No Statements” and “Blick.” In fact, we’re still catching our breath.

6 Awesome Tips to Make Your Feet Look Fabulous,"How to treat your feet right? Our feet go through a tough time every day with all the rush of modern life, long lines, and uncomfortable footwear which can lead to discomfort and affect our overall health. Here’re the most useful foot care tips to make your feet and toenails look gorgeous.

TIMESTAMPS:
Keep your feet dry 0:35

Keep your toenails healthy 1:45
Soak your feet in warm water 2:32
Moisturize your feet 3:04
Massage your feet 3:25
How to break in a new pair of shoes 3:50

SUMMARY:
- One of the basic principles of hygiene is to keep your feet dry since moist conditions create a favorable environment for fungus to grow. 
- To make your feet look gorgeous and your heels feel baby soft, soak your feet in warm water for 15-20 minutes once a week.
- It’s best to use creams that contain emollients, such as dimethicone, lanolin, and Vaseline, as well as moisturizing ingredients, such as glycerin and lecithin.
- Foot massage is the best remedy to get rid of fatigue, improve blood circulation, and keep your feet healthy.
- To reduce friction between your feet and shoes, use baby powder. Just sprinkle some baby powder into your pumps before putting them on. 
- To reduce friction between your feet and shoes, apply some roll-on or stick deodorant to the problem areas.
- Fill 2 plastic bags with water. Put them in the toe of each shoe. Then place them in the freezer, and leave overnight. As the water freezes, it will expand in the bag and stretch the shoe.
- If you tape your third and fourth toes (counting from the big toe) together, you will feel more comfortable in your pumps.

Points on line of reflection | Transformations | Geometry | Khan Academy,"Courses on Khan Academy are always 100% free. Start practicing—and saving your progress—now:  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-reflections/v/points-on-line-of-reflection


Points on line of reflection

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Fastest Cars We EVER Tested - INSANE Lucid Air Sapphire vs Tesla Plaid 1/2 Mile Drag Race | 2200+ HP,"It’s the drag race you’ve all been waiting for - the Tesla Model S Plaid vs the Lucid Sapphire. And while you may have seen these two drag racing before, we guarantee you haven’t seen anything like this, because we’re taking these two super sedans - all 2284 horsepower of them - through a full half mile. ➡️ https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2024-lucid-air-sapphire-first-test-review/

In addition, we did full instrumented testing on both cars, measuring their 0-60, 0-100, 1/4 mile and 1/2 mile times. We also did 60-0 braking tests, before taking the Tesla and the Lucid out on to the streets, to find out if either of these neutron-powered rocketships are actually any good to drive.

Changing Perceptions of Women's Roles in Yemen,"To mark this year's International Women’s Day, we asked women around the world who are leaders and changemakers for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to share their stories. Khadija Al-Haj is a human resources assistant at MSF’s project in Abs, Yemen. As part of a conservative community, she initially faced social restrictions that made doing her job difficult. “What was helpful for me was my family support because they gave me their trust,” she said. She now sees herself as part of a movement that has helped change the community’s perspective on the roles women can play in society. Read more at https://bit.ly/3vFzv9v

25 OUTFIT HACKS THAT ARE ABSOLUTE LIFESAVERS,"AWESOME OUTFIT HACKS 

This time I wanna share with you cool hacks for unexpected situations when you might need some quick emergency fixing.

This one used to happen to me all the time. Whenever I put on my cheeky pair of ripped jeans, every single time my left leg slipped into knee hole! It's not very pleasant and there's always a fear to damage your favorite jeans. Here's the solution I came up with recently.

I cut off the rest of old threads. And made neat stitches with white thread all over again. It worked as charm!

And I'm sick and tired of my bra straps slipping down. I always face this problem during summertime. Here's what I do:

I make a little braid - like bridge with threads under the top strap and then a bra strap goes through that bridge. It's as simple as that!

I’m currently working on a project that requires the use of stiffened felt.  You can buy it already stiffened at the craft store, but then you are limited to the colors and sizes that they carry.  Also, if you know me, you know I am particular about what kind of felt I use.  

It was surprisingly easy and cheap to stiffen the felt myself.  There are lots of different methods out there, but for my purposes, I found using regular old white school glue worked great!  So here you go, here’s how to stiffen felt with school glue.

To stiffen felt, you will need:
felt
white school glue
warm water
old container
wax paper
iron and ironing board

And here's one of the most problems 3:32 and I bet you've experienced it! You know what I'm talking about! : )

So just stick two straps of the stiffened felt to your favorite shorts and walk freely and comfortably!

Lyrics:
A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who’ve gone before us and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
 
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all
 
And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever
 
If you’ve been forgiven and if you’ve been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We’ll sing the song forever and amen
 
Hear your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever
 
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Qasem Soleimani: Mourners flood the streets as body returns to Iran - BBC News,"Hundreds of thousands of mourners have turned out in Iran to receive home the remains of Qasem Soleimani, the general killed by a US drone strike in Iraq.

In Ahvaz, where Soleimani served during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88), mourners chanted: ""Death to America.""

Soleimani was the architect of Iran's sphere of influence across the Middle East, and was considered to be the country's second most powerful man.

His assassination marked a significant escalation between Iran and the US.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who had a close personal relationship with Soleimani, has warned of ""severe revenge"" for the attack, and analysts say Iran may pursue cyber-attacks against the US or traditional attacks on US targets or interests in the Middle East.

Coronavirus: Scaled back Hajj pilgrimage begins in Saudi Arabia - BBC News,"Today is the full day of the annual Islamic pilgrimage, Hajj. Every year almost two and a half million Muslims head to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina  to take part in the event. But due to the coronavirus pandemic, Saudi Arabia had decided to heavily restrict the number of residents who can visit the holy sites.

Lyrics
Can't be sleepin'
Keep on waking
Is that the woman next to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it?
I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby
Yeah (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I got defense
(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I'm sorry
Oh, I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ACl8s_tBzE

Coronavirus: US faced with protests amid pressure to reopen - BBC News,"Protesters have taken to the streets in states across the US, demanding that governors reopen economies shut by the coronavirus pandemic.

Rallies in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Washington state took place on Sunday, following earlier protests in half a dozen states.

Agitation for easing restrictions has grown, despite the risk of a Covid-19 resurgence posed by reopening too soon.

US President Donald Trump has signalled support for the protests.

The US has become the centre of the Covid-19 crisis, with over 735,000 cases and some 40,000 deaths - but signs have emerged that it is reaching the apex of the outbreak and that infection rates are slowing in some states.

"Leebrian - ""Rookie"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Leebrian - Rookie (Vevo DSCVR)

If you're a young reggaeton artist, and Sky invites you into his world, there's a pretty good chance you're gonna be buzzin' soon. That's what has happened Leebrian, a San Juan native on the come-up who has a knack for making informality the coolest way to get the job done. His rhymes are both fluid and agile, and on tracks such as “Goku Sin El Ki” and “ Flow Payco” the 18-year-old MC prioritizes fun. The rhythm and melody for the latter track were inspired by an ice cream truck jingle. Leebrian Canales always new he had a knack for writing, and he rapping chops became obvious when he caused a stir on Freestyle Mania’s IG page. When superstar producer Sky caught him in action, Leebrian was invited to be part of the producer’s Black Koi Entertainment squad. We had a chance to connect with the young MC – now based in Florida – during a New York visit. The swag of our DSCVR artist was front and center while rolling through “Rookie” and “Me Enredas.""

REI AMI - damn. (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"REI AMI  - damn. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

“My haters happen to be broke. And that’s not my fault.” We’ve had lots of big personalities roll through DSCVR, but the way REI AMI capped her performance of “RICKY BOBBY” shows why she’s one of the biggest and boldest. Born in South Korea and raised in the States, the alt-pop pixie makes a living with her audacity. Until pretty recently, REI was actually making a living, by day, working at a packaging company. By night, she was posting thorny anti-pop bops under her Sailor Moon-inspired pseudonym. Soundcloud heads latched onto “Dictator,” “Make It Mine,” and “Snowcone,” all zany flights of fancy made cohesive by their intended lack of it. In the vid for the latter, REI licks a snow cone as the Washington Monument looms in the background — that’s symbolism for ya. One day in late 2019, a coworker, who also happened to be a fan, recognized her. That’s when REI AMI realized she was really onto something. Like a lot of her Instagram-bred contemporaries, REI AMI’s artistry doesn’t stop at music; in music vids and on her own social media accounts, the anime-head commands her aesthetics like a stylist. Which brings us back to her DSCVR performances of “RICKY BOBBY” and “damn,” both from her stellar new ‘FOIL’ mixtape. It’s rare that a new artist has a swag that wholly transforms our DSCVR studio into their personal playground, but that’s exactly what REI AMI does here.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D4oP8UJQ90

"Not a Single Marriage for 50 years in This Village, Locals Explain Why","The village of Barwan Kala is one of the most unusual places in the world. For 50 years, it hadn’t seen a single wedding. 121 – the highest number of unmarried men in the entire state of Bihar, India! This so-called “Village of Bachelors” wasn’t a paradise for singles to enjoy their solitude by conscious choice. No, it was much more complicated than that…

Nobody came to this remote little pocket because it was so cut-off from the rest of the world! For a long time, the village didn’t have electricity, water, phone network, healthcare center – they didn’t even have a road into and out of the place! If residents wanted to go to the closest town (nearly 30 miles away), they had to walk through winding hills and a dense jungle for 4 hours! Let's find out more about one of the strangest places on Earth.

Dear Silas - Skrr Skrr (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Dear Silas - “Skrr Skrr” Live Performance | Vevo

In Dear Silas' young career, the Jackson, Mississippi rapper already caught a wave or two as the beneficiary of an LOL moment going viral. Most recently, his “Skrr Skrr” soundtracked a 'Dexter Laboratory' meme. But Dear Silas is no joke, and neither is his music. With a smooth delivery and quick wit, Silas Stapleton's projects, ‘The Last Cherry Blossom’ and ‘The Day I Died,' have gained a devoted following. The former is expected to be re-packaged and re-released as a part of Dear Silas' new pact with RCA Records. Check him out on the Vevo set, where he was tapped as our latest DSCVR act and delivered moody takes on “Skrr Skrr” and “Under My Feet.”

sanah - Invisible dress (Vevo DSCVR At Home),"sanah - Invisible dress. An exclusive at-home performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

It’s not often that our DSCVR artists’ music videos have over 35 million views, but that’s the massive number sanah’s “szampan” has surpassed since its release at the top of 2020. The Polish indie-pop singer’s hit - “champagne” in English - has added substantial popularity to her unique blend of baroque-meets-Top 40 songwriting. You’ll see on her Instagram that the regal feel of her music extends to her fashion aesthetic - favoring flowing dresses and floral bouquets. That look was in full-effect for her DSCVR shoot, too, during which she not only sang but wowed us further with her violin skills. Performances of “Invisible dress” and “Siebie zapytasz,” a trotting ballade from her recently released full-length “Królowa dram,” will charm both Polska fans and inquisitive ears all over the world.

"Mexico missing: 'If I find a body, I recover a piece of my son' - BBC News","There are now almost 100,000 people missing in Mexico, according to figures released by the National Search Commission.

The majority have disappeared amid the drug war violence of the past decade and a half, with most being killed by drug cartels and dumped in unmarked graves. 

Family members across the country have taken on the task of searching for their missing loved ones themselves.

BBC Correspondent Will Grant joined one group searching the inhospitable desert of the northern state of Sonora.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EKuR2bCL1Q

What we'll miss about Joe Biden? BBC News,"Vice-President Joe Biden has announced he will not seek the Democratic nomination in 2016.  The former senator, who ran for the White House in both 1988 and 2008, is one of the most respected politicians of his generation. But his unique political style - authentic and emotional in an era of packaged politicians - also made him vulnerable to making gaffes. 
Here are some of the ""only Joe"" moments we're likely to miss on the campaign trail this time.  Photos from Getty Images, AP, AFP, Reuters, and Carrie Dann/NBC News. Video produced by the BBC's Franz Strasser

"EXTREME Street Food in Africa!! SEAFOOD MOUNTAIN on Beach in Dakar, Senegal!!","🇸🇳 Senegal Street Food in Dakar: https://youtu.be/XywvIiAIRzE
🌶️ Ghost Chili Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link Amazon US)

KAYAR, SENEGAL - Today we are on the coast of Senegal and we are going to explore the amazing seafood of the country. We’ll be starting at one of the biggest fishing villages in Senegal, then we’ll be touring Lake Retba, known as the pink lake, experiencing the Dakar rally, and finishing with one of the greatest Senegalese seafood street food meals in Dakar!

Kayar -  We first started with a walk through Kayar, one of the main fishing villages in West Africa on the coast of Senegal. The fish they catch will be transported throughout Africa. It’s quite an unbelievable spectacle to see all the colorful fishing boats lined up on the beach. One of the main fish they were catching today was monk-fish.

Chez Salim (https://goo.gl/maps/cQxTitw7nBDeWjnAA) - For lunch we headed to Chez Salim, along the banks of Lake Retba, and also the location where the Dakar Rally finishes. Lunch was simple but it was a delicious plate of monkfish stir fried with peppers and onions and served with guana chili sauce on the side.

Lake Retba, Senegal - We then took a boat on Lake Retba, also known as the pink lake, and the source of a huge salt industry. It’s an extremely salty lake that replenishes itself with salt. Much of West Africa relies on the salt from this lake. It was very cool to see. Also, the lake is the traditional home of the finish like of the famous Dakar Rally. We jumped in a land cruiser and took a spin on the dunes along the beach - it was thrilling.

Court of Cassation - Finally to end this amazing day of seafood in Senegal we drove back to Dakar and headed straight to Court of Cassation. In the evening you’ll find a number of seafood beach food stalls that sell everything you can imagine from the sea. You choose what you want, they grill and boil it, and serve it on a tray with the world’s greatest onion, mustard, and pepper sauce. To fit with the theme of the day, we stuck with a monkfish, and it was delicious! Additionally, before eating seafood I tried a unique local West African fruit called saba senegalensis fruit.

And that completes an incredible day of seafood street food in Senegal!

Jordan Adetunji - Introducing Jordan Adetunji | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025,"Introducing Jordan Adetunji | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

The constant state of evolution in which Jordan Adetunji exists makes him worth your attention. The Belfast native’s chameleonic qualities were there at the beginning in 2020, a debut year in which he dropped dancehall-coded R&B (“Close 2 You”), emo drill (“Around”), and autotune-drenched Afro percussion (“Black Kings” with jahmiel). As a teen, JA dove head first into the glimmering Nigerian pop of Wizkid and Burna Boy; concurrently, he took notes on the spitting skills of English rhymers J Hus and Yxng Bane. These influences are right up front in those early releases. In 2023, the Joy Division fan leveled up again when he incorporated angular guitar riffs into the trendy oomph of Jersey club with “YOU & I.” You won’t ever hear a song quite like it. Fans and followers who liked what they heard were rewarded with the 9-song ‘ROCK & RAVE’ project later that year. All that momentum led to “KEHLANI,” hisTop 10 charting, career-defining ode to the American R&B singer. “I was posting it everyday, thinking ‘she has to respond,’” he told us. And she did, hopping on a remix a couple months later. For Jordan, 2025 is another opportunity to keep fans surprised. “This is not like this,” is how he envisions fans' reactions to new music. “So that’s exciting.”

George Floyd: African-Americans are more likely to get fatally shot - BBC News,"The death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests have once again raised questions about how police in the US treat African Americans, and how protests there are policed. 
This week of turmoil in the US began with the horrific video of George Floyd, a black man, struggling to breath while being knelt on by a white police officer. 
Since then hundreds of other videos and testimony have followed - detailing police violence and discrimination across America.

#BBCOS #BBCOutsideSource 
The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population.

In fact, in 2019, although African-Americans made up less than 14% of the population (according to official census figures), they accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police.

And that figure has been relatively consistent since 2017, whereas the number of white victims has come down since then.

"Nile dam dispute: Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan agree to resume talks - BBC News","The first-year target for filling the controversial mega dam on the River Nile has been reached, Ethiopia says.

This would allow the first set of turbines to be tested.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's announcement came as Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan agreed to resume talks over the dam, following a virtual summit.

The project has been a source of huge diplomatic tension since its construction began in Ethiopia in 2011.

Ethiopia sees the hydroelectric project as crucial for its economic growth and a vital source of energy.

Israel claims it’s killed Hezbollah’s top military commander in Beirut airstrike | BBC News,"Israel has carried out an airstrike on Beirut which it says targeted and killed the most senior military commander of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.   

Israel Defence Forces named their target as Fuad Shukr who they said he is also known as Hajj Mohsin and said he was the senior military advisor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, describing him as his “right-hand man.”   

The IDF said he was behind a recent rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and young people.  Hezbollah has denied involvement in that attack.

There have been warnings that Israel and Lebanon may be on the brink of war and a major escalation of the conflict that began with the October 7th attacks in Israel and its war against Hamas in Gaza.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020!

Teddy Swims - Picky (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Teddy Swims - Picky. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

They say don’t judge a book by its cover. At a glance, the outward appearance of Jaten Dimsdale, aka Teddy Swims, is an amalgamation of ZZ Top and a high-fashion boutique owner. His face tats bring Post Malone to mind, the beard is Stapleton-esque. When Teddy opens his mouth, a honey-drizzled croon emerges, and the rasp accompanying it brokers a deep sense of soul. The smooth recipe uses a lil funk, a lil R&B and a dash of hip-hop. On his wildly popular YouTube channel, his HD covers ranging from Shania Twain to Summer Walker bank hundreds of thousands of views. The name “Swims” is an acronym for “someone who isn’t me sometimes.” It’s perhaps a nod to his varied interests and shapeshifting musicality - one that’ll keep fans on their toes while earning him new listeners. “Picky” is Swims latest gem, and it’s got a super fun music vid to go along with it. Teddy stopped by to roll through that and “Night Off.” Check ‘em both. Your ears will thank you.

Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms - BBC News,"This is a country which is starting to feel the very real fear of hunger.

The weather is turning from early autumn warmth to a sharp chill. Several areas are reporting drought, which adds to the sense of growing catastrophe.

The WFP is faced with having to raise its supplies to Afghanistan to help more than 22 million people.

If the weather is as bad as experts are predicting this winter, the expectation is that large numbers will be threatened with acute hunger and widespread famine.

Supporting Rohingya Survivors of Sexual Violence: Ruksana's Story,"Sexual violence can be opportunistic or organized. It can be a reason to flee, but also can be experienced along the journey at any stage of displacement.

Ruksana, a midwife, has been working in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, for six years. In August 2017 her clinic started to see a sharp increase in patients who had suffered sexual violence among the new influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.

Sexual violence is a medical emergency, requiring treatment within an urgent window of time to prevent an unwanted pregnancy or possible infections such as HIV. Too often, the window for prevention is closed by the time care is sought.

Psychological support is also essential to aid resilience and recovery. But due to stigma, shame, or simply being overwhelmed by other demands, survivors of violence may not seek care.

LYRICS:
When my troubles are a little too heavy 
Who I can turn to, to share the weight? 
When my mind is cluttered and cloudy 
Who can I turn to, to clear the way 
Who can I turn to, I turn to You 

I won’t lean on 
My own 
Understanding 
I will let go 
Follow 
Empty handed
You say Your yoke is easy 
You say Your burden’s light 
So I’ll let You
Lead me
For all my life 
When my past is still trying to haunt me 
Who can I turn to, to give me grace 
When my future is a little uncertain 
Who can I turn to, turn to today 
Who can I turn to, I turn to You 

Some days are long, some work is tough 
Whatever I lack You make it up
Your yoke is easy, Your burden is light 
You gave me life, You give me love 
Whenever I’m dry You fill my cup 
Your yoke is easy, Your burden is light 
I won’t lean on 
My own 
Understanding 
I will let go 
Follow 
Empty handed
You say Your yoke is easy 
You say Your burden’s light 
So I’ll let You
Lead me
For all my life 
I know Your yoke is easy 
I know Your burden’s light
So I’ll let You 
Lead me
For all my life

Lyrics:
I was there the moment that it happened
But you couldn’t see me through the pain
I caught every tear as they were falling
When you lost your heart that day
Yeah you lost your heart that day

Now you only see through broken lenses
Trying to keep your head above the shame
You believe the lie that I am distant
But I hold you every day
Yeah I hold you every day

If you could see it through my eyes
You’d know that you are wanted
You’d know that you are wanted
If you’d let my love inside
I’ll show you that you’re wanted
I’ll show you that you’re wanted

You’re more than all your darkest moments
You are defined by what I see
You’re my reflection, you’re my treasure, you’re my heartbeat
Oh child you belong to me

Not rejected, not unwelcome
You’re wanted, you’re wanted
Not abandoned, not forgotten
You’re wanted, you’re wanted

I’m right here in this moment
And I’m singing over you
Yeah I’m singing over you

"Flying Train Is Already in Works, and It's As Wild As It Sounds","With high-speed rail, traveling by trains often turns out to be faster than by car or by bus. Very often it even results being faster than flying. But what if trains could transform into planes? Imagine a plane landing at its final destination: its wings come off, it's set on a railway track and becomes a train. Could this time-saving dream become a reality any time soon?

"Why This Kimono Costs $10,000","Kimonos are like the VIPs of the fashion world, and that price tag ain't playing around. First off, it's all about the craftsmanship – these babies are handmade with intricate designs and top-notch fabrics that can take forever to create. Plus, traditional dyeing techniques and embroidery add extra flair, and those skilled artisans deserve their coin. Quality silk doesn't come cheap, my friend, and since kimonos use a ton of it, that's a big chunk of the expense right there. Add in the fact that each layer of the kimono has a specific purpose, and you've got a garment with a lot more thought than your average tee. So, yeah, when it comes to kimonos, you're not just buying clothes – you're investing in a masterpiece. 🎨👘

'No work and no money': Afghans settle into life under Taliban rule - BBC News,"Afghanistan is facing an economic crisis, with foreign reserves frozen as the international community decides how to help Afghans but not the Taliban. 

There are restrictions on cash withdrawals and long queues at banks. 

Second-hand markets have sprung up in cities across the country, with desperate Afghans trying to sell their possessions just to be able to afford enough to eat.

One woman, Shagufta, told us: ""The Islamic Emirate is good, there's no theft or crime anymore. We just have one problem, there's no work and no money.""

Cossacks riding Russia's patriotic wave - BBC News,"The Cossacks were Russian military horsemen who saw themselves as Orthodox Christian warriors, in voluntary service to the tsar. Repressed after the Bolshevik Revolution, since the collapse of the Soviet Union they have re-emerged and are trying to revive Cossack traditions. Ilya Okhotnikov served in Russia's special forces and comes from a long line of Cossacks. When he retired he moved out of the city and started building a traditional Cossack settlement where he is trying to continue the Cossack way of life.

"Trump says he is doing well, but next couple of days the 'real test' - BBC News","US President Donald Trump says he is doing well, but that the next few days will be the ""real test"".

The video, posted on Twitter on Saturday evening, comes after mixed messages earlier in the day about his health, after a Covid-19 diagnosis.

The president's physician said late on Saturday that Mr Trump was doing well and had made ""substantial progress since diagnosis"".

Mr Trump is spending his second night in hospital.

Dr Sean Conley said in a statement that ""while not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic"" about the president's condition.

A few hours earlier, in the four-minute video message, Mr Trump, dressed in a suit jacket and shirt with no tie, thanked the doctors and nurses at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center close to Washington DC, where he is being treated.

Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts.

Teachers and transport workers have been joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for a general walkout.

President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Fivio Foreign - Big Drip (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Fivio Foreign - Big Drip. An exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.  

Born and raised in Brooklyn, Fivio Foreign is as cool as the snowflake inked under his left eye. A self-proclaimed laid back dude, even his artist name was informally chosen. When his son said he looked like “Fabio,” mistakenly pronouncing it “Fivio,"" daddy just rolled with it. The viral vid for “Big Drip” supports that kind of playful personality. In it, Fivi’s crew parties on the sidewalks of DUMBO, one of BK’s poshest nabes. It's all about fun: twerkin’ in front of Shake Shack, and throwin' down on Fulton Ferry Landing before heading back to the crib for some water gun battles. But listeners who have been paying attention to Fivi since his “Deli” days know there’s an underlying aggression behind his calm exterior. Along with the late Pop Smoke, he’s become part of a new Brooklyn drill scene that mixes raw elements of UK grime and OG Chicago drill sounds. “I’m ushering in a new wave,” Fivio proudly declares. “I want everyone to start knowing my face like how they know my music.” Couldn’t think of a better way to make that happen than comin' thru our DSCVR studio. Make sure the subwoofer is working on the speakers and enjoy ""Big Drip"" and ""Wetty."" The MC’s name might be a playful mistake, but his success won’t be.

"Islamic State kidnapped Ericsson telecoms workers, leak says - BBC News","In 2014 Islamic State (IS) seized Iraq's second-city, Mosul. At the time, a senior lawyer at the telecoms company Ericsson recommended shutting down the company's operation in Iraq, but senior managers ignored this, according to a report seen by the BBC.

Affan was among a group of engineers doing fieldwork for Ericsson when IS took over the city. He was sent, by Ericsson, to ask IS for permission to continue working in Mosul but instead he was kidnapped and held while IS demanded ransom from the company.

These revelations have come from documents leaked in the last week to the International Consortium of International Journalists and shared with the BBC and 29 other media partners.

Riley Clemmons - Headspace (Live Performance) | Vevo,"Riley Clemmons - Headspace (Live)  | Vevo Studio Performance

You could see that something was happening when Riley Clemmons’ debut dropped three years ago. The impressive “Broken Prayers” proved it had deep resonance with fans, and that its message of hope wasn’t falling on deaf ears. The Nashville native, who has wanted to be a musician since her childhood days and has a history of community theater work, met her manager in her early teens - writing and performing have been goals for a long time. Now 21, Clemmons is fulfilling on those dreams. Just released on Friday, her second album ‘Godsend’ will take her even farther. The singer’s pop music smarts are enhanced by a production sense that’s dreamy, immediate and radio friendly. Deeply appreciated in the realm of Christian music, she’s the youngest person to ever be nominated in the K-LOVE Awards (“Female Artist of the Year” - 2021) and often makes a dent on Billboard’s Contemporary Christian chart. She has said that the essence of her recent “Keep On Hoping” is “finding grace in the act of forgiveness” and “finding joy in something as simple as the gift of a sunrise.” There’s a grand sweep to these new tracks, and their power becomes even more obvious in the two performances Clemmons delivered in the Vevo studio. “Headspace” suggests that her latest work should be embraced by a larger pop audience who embraces strong craft and subtle passion. Her talent as both writer and performer is right up front. Stay close - more coming.

Sing about sex in a fun way and you just might go from zero to hero. That’s kinda what happened to Guaynaa. The Puerto Rican upstart’s “ReBoTa” was an irresistible track that brought risqué lyrics to lots of listeners. But it did it with a smile on its face, in the process earning itself a crazy number of Spotify streams and YouTube views. The 24-year-old Caguas native and Tego Calderón fan, who earned props early on for a satiric freestyle indictment of the island's Hurricane Maria tragedy, has hit the ground running from there, bringing his infectious charisma to a string of tracks that proves he’s here to stay. He’s not lacking anything in the humor department. Join the 22 million viewers who have checked out his hilarious “Buyaka” video in the last eight weeks and you’ll see that he can hang with any crowd, even a glistening work crew of studmuffins. When Guaynaa hit our Brooklyn studio for the Artists To Watch performances of “Chicharrón” and “Buyaka,” he was electric. We’d say don’t take your eyes off him, but considering all the views this broki racks up, we bet you can’t.

AMARIA BB - It's On (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Amaria BB - It's On. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Amaria BB has self-confidence that's backed by lots of skill. Example: the Jamaican-born, London-raised singer brushes off most comparisons to fellow UK dancehall artists, saying her unique brand of Caribbean-inflected R&B has “never been done before.” Citing Patti Labelle as her biggest influence, the up-and-comer looks to the emotional vulnerability of powerful 70s and 80s soul singers as her inspiration. Example two: her saucy and sexual lyrics are sure to raise eyebrows; she writes like she doesn’t care who’s listening. When she was ten, Amaria (that’s her real name, the BB part is a secret) performed at Harlem's Apollo Theater, so she probably didn't have many butterflies when she hit our DSCVR studio to knock out  “On It” and “Slow Motion"" from her new ‘What’s Done In The Dark’ EP. The latter song has been buzzing since last summer, and we’ve got a feeling all her tracks will be blasting from Hackney to Harlem this summer too.

"Israel agrees to release Palestinian prisoners after delay, officials say | BBC News","Israeli and Hamas officials have said the latest setback in the Gaza ceasefire deal has been resolved by mediators.
 
Israel had delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of Israeli hostages being handed over by Hamas. 
 
Hamas said this was a serious violation of the deal.
 
It is now expected that the prisoners will be freed as well as another group, possibly later on Wednesday or Thursday, in exchange for the return of the bodies of four hostages.

HUMANITARIAN SNAPSHOT   Doctor in South Sudan,"Please  Subscribe MSF International  Channel 🆘

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

The woman 3D-printing schools in Madagascar – BBC News,"Maggie Grout has just printed her first school in Madagascar - only the second 3D-printed school in the world.

She started the NGO, Thinking Huts, as a teenager, with the aim of 3D-printing schools in countries where some children lack the opportunity to get an education.

Printing schools is fast, once the printer is set up, and saves on building materials.

Maggie says she is motivated to help underprivileged children partly because she was born in poverty in China, before being adopted by American parents.

LYRICS
Good God Almighty 
I hope You’ll find me
Praising Your Name no matter what comes

 I can’t count the times I’ve called Your name some broken night 
 And You showed up and patched me up like You do every time 
 I get amnesia, I forget that You keep coming around 
 Yeah, ain’t no way You’ll ever let me down 

Good God Almighty 
I hope You’ll find me
Praising Your Name no matter what comes
Cause I know where I’d be
Without Your mercy 
So I keep praising Your name at the top of my lungs 

Tell me is He good? (He’s good)
Tell me is He God? (He’s God)
He is Good God Almighty 

You say Your love goes on forever, that Your mercy never stops
So why would I assume You’d be somebody that You’re not 
Like sun in the morning, I know You’re gonna be there every day
So what on earth could make me be afraid 

Praise Him in the morning 
Praise Him in the noon time
Praise Him when the sun goes down
Love Him in the morning
Love Him in the noon time
Love Him when the sun goes down

Jesus in the morning 
Jesus in the noon time
Jesus when the sun goes down
Jesus in the morning 
Jesus in the noon time
Jesus when the sun goes down",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TzECToPYIk

"Celebrating Viking at 40 on This Week @NASA – July 22, 2016","Forty years ago, on July 20, 1976, Viking 1 became the first U.S. spacecraft to successfully land on Mars. To celebrate the anniversary of the historic robotic feat and to highlight NASA’s effort to send humans to Mars in the 2030s, Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia hosted a two-day “Viking at 40” event. On July 19, NASA’s Chief Historian Bill Barry moderated a history discussion about the Viking program and its contribution to Mars exploration. The next day, a 40th anniversary symposium called, “From NASA’s First Soft Landing to Humans on Mars” included a host of programs and featured Chief Scientist Ellen Stofan and other NASA experts discussing the agency’s Journey to Mars. Later that evening, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden was on hand at Nationals Park in Washington, as Viking 1 and the Apollo 11 moon landing anniversaries were recognized during a celebration of significant American firsts. These momentous events both happened on July 20, seven years apart.

DNC 2024: Barack and Michelle Obama tell voters to back 'new chapter' with Kamala Harris,"Barack and Michelle Obama have given impassioned endorsements of Kamala Harris, urging voters to back a ""new chapter"" and vote for the Democratic candidate for president.

In back-to-back speeches at the party convention, both of them called on Democrats to get out and vote and said November's election was going to be close.

The former US president and first lady also both made reference to a renewal of hope and excitement in the party – a not-so-subtle reference to the huge crowds and unfettered excitement that the party felt when Obama first ran for president in 2008.

Welcome to our TREEHOUSE! Easy DIY Project For Beginners with Pallets and Workshop Gadgets,"Making a treehouse from scratch using things everyone can easily find.
Ok folks, today we decided to get a bit adventurous and create a cozy treehouse – kinda like the ones we had in our “secret clubs” as kids. This would be the perfect hideout when you want to relax and free your mind. First, we took four large, long, pointy wood pieces and built a sturdy foundation from the treehouse. Then we started adding more to make it safe for everyone. 

When the foundation was created, we took four wooden pallets to make the floor. Then, we took some wooden panels and laid them on the bed to give it a smooth surface, and we used nails to secure them down. We added the ladder to allow everyone to get in and then fancy flooring to make it cute and cozy. We’ve painted its beautiful green color to make it stand out and used a large picture frame to create a window. We used flowers to decorate the deck for the finishing touches and added a beautiful entrance mat for our visiting guests.

"Treating HIV/AIDS in DRC: After 20 Years, MSF Sees Progress and Problems","Two decades ago, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was the first to provide free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to people living with HIV in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The high price and scarcity of ARVs in 2002 were the equivalent of a death sentence for so many people at the time, the program was quickly overwhelmed. 

Since then, MSF has been a key player in the fight against HIV/AIDS in DRC, and much progress has been made. But an ongoing lack of funding, training for care providers, and ARVs has caused thousands of preventable deaths due to HIV/AIDS every year. “To realize today that we still have a long way to go,” says Dr. Maria Mashako, who has worked at MSF’s clinic in the capital Kinshasa for 20 years. “It’s very frustrating to see that patients still arrive in (severely ill) condition.” 

More than 500,000 people are living with HIV in DRC today, and one in five people still do not have access to treatment, according to the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Only one-third of the children who need treatment are receiving it. Last year, HIV/AIDS caused nearly 14,000 deaths, and close to 20,000 people were newly infected. In 2015, United Nations (UN) member states committed to ending AIDS by 2030 as part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. In DRC, MSF sees that unless donor countries make a much stronger effort to meet the needs, HIV/AIDS will not be a disease of the past any time soon. Read more at XXX

Ben Shapiro: US commentator clashes with BBC's Andrew Neil - BBC News,"He has more than 2 million followers on Twitter, 600,000 YouTube subscribers and his videos on the Daily Wire channel rack up millions of views.

Ben Shapiro is a controversial figure but one of the US' leading conservative political commentators. His book, The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great, is a New York Times bestseller.

In a spiky Politics Live interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Shapiro refers to an incident which took place between Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields in 2016.

Although a charge was brought at the time against Mr Lewandowski, Florida prosecutors dropped the case.

This is an unedited version of their interview, which was terminated by Mr Shapiro.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Leonard Susskind is a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University, and founding director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. He is widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory and in general as one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a researcher and an educator.

India Covid crisis leaves Covax scheme 140 million doses short - BBC News,"Covax, the international scheme to ensure equal access to coronavirus vaccines, is 140 million doses short because of India's continuing Covid crisis.

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest single supplier to the Covax scheme, has made none of its planned shipments since exports were suspended in March.

The UN children's agency Unicef buys and distributes vaccines for Covax. It is urging leaders of G7 nations and EU states to share their doses.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Why We Have a New Year's Ball Drop,"Why do we drop a ball in Times Square on New Year’s Eve? Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice explore this New Year’s tradition and its connection to astrophysicists, the stars, and ocean navigation. 

Where did the ball drop come from? To figure this out, we take a dive back in time to the creation of different timezones, latitude, and longitude. Why is it so hard to figure out longitude? Find out how we determined the prime meridian and how ocean navigators used the stars to determine their position on the open sea. Learn about how ships keep accurate time and how the ball drop came to be. Would we have this NYE tradition if it weren’t for early ocean travel?

Lyrics:

I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
About everything that you're going through
My girl, you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've been dreaming 'bout us
Working hard and saving it up
We'll go and see the man on the moon
My girl, we've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head, and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

My girl, my girl
It takes one hard second to turn it around
It takes one hard second to turn it around

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head, and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've got time and I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Will Yellowstone Supervolcano Erupt? Neil deGrasse Tyson & Volcanologist Janine Krippner Investigate,"You’ve probably heard about the supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park. And you’ve also probably heard that it’s on the verge of erupting and destroying the world. Well, in this StarTalk explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice talk with volcanologist Janine Krippner, PhD, about what’s actually going on. 

What is a supervolcano? Janine tells us how the made-up term has worked its way into popular doomsday language. Find out just how large an eruption would be from a supervolcano. You’ll learn the difference between a crater vs a caldera.

Then, we investigate the likelihood that the Yellowstone supervolcano will erupt. Janine tells us why everything you read in the news about this supervolcano is an exaggeration. We explore the differences between supervolcanoes and eruptions that cause flood basalts like the Deccan Traps. All that, plus, Janine gives us a tagline for volcanology.

Why has Russia targeted the media in the Ukraine conflict? - BBC News,"Russia's war, as it invades Ukraine, is accompanied by an information battle which has put different pressures on media reporting.

Some broadcasts in Ukraine were taken off air after a fatal Russian missile attack on Kyiv's TV tower, which left five dead.

Meanwhile in Russia, TV stations are required by the media watchdog to only use information from official Russian sources when reporting the invasion 

Some independent Russian media stations, such as TV channel Dozhd and popular liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy have been taken off air.

The BBC's Ros Atkins looks at the role of the media through the experiences of seven people.

What If You Fly for 1 Year Non-Stop,"What if a millionaire offers to pay for all your traveling aspirations? Only one condition: first, you have to fly continuously for a year, non-stop. Clouds after clouds after clouds. Would you say yes? If you accepted, what would it be like? 

Jet lag would probably the first thing that comes to mind since this is the most familiar side effect after a long flight. If 6-8 hours make your head feel the weight of the world, then can you imagine what 365 days up in the air would do? Well, honestly, this is the very least of your worries, considering everything else flying does to your body.

SUMMARY:
- Even if you’re not on an airplane, but maybe visiting some place with a high altitude, you can experience an uncomfortable feeling in your ear, and even have difficulty hearing. 
- The lack of movement that’s being observed by your eyes will directly conflict with what your inner ear is experiencing, sending mixed signals to your brain. This contradiction will be the reason for your stomach ache.
- The pressure is still the one to blame for this one. As you go higher in the air, the gas inside you expands, causing the unexpected ache that you’re feeling. It’ll help you a lot if you don’t try to hold the gas inside you though since that only makes you feel worse and more bloated. 
- Airplanes were designed to be able to handle the pressure. But due to being above the horizon, your blood will absorb less oxygen than usual. 
- They’re actually doing it for your own good! It’s been suggested that a healthy environment would have about 50 to 60 percent water vapor present in the air. Sadly, inside an airplane cabin, it can dip as low as 10 percent, which makes it drier than the desert. 
- The dryness of the air up there will not only affect your hydration, but also mess with your sense of smell. And guess what: being able to smell food is essential for your brain to also recognize how it tastes.
- The Journal of Environmental Health Research also concluded that the risk of catching colds is a hundred times higher when you’re on an airplane.
- Some studies have shown that spending 56 minutes at such an altitude is equal to spending 20 minutes tanning.

End Fossil Crimes: Typhoon Mawar,"Typhoon Mawar, packed with heavy rainfall and strong winds, approached the northern provinces in the Philippines prompting evacuation of hundreds of villagers living in areas at risk flooding or landslides.

As typhoons get more frequent, more intense and more unpredictable, the climate crisis has become a new normal in the Philippines — along with the fear and anxiety that comes with it.

Fossil fuel companies must stop burning fossil fuels that exacerbate the climate crisis and pay reparations for climate impacts they are contributing to in the Philippines and all over the globe.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

"If You See Square Waves, Get Out of the Water Immediately!","There’re various strange natural phenomena that might occur right near you and it’s better to know them well and be prepared. If you know what to expect from this or that natural phenomenon, you know what to do and whether you need to run away ASAP. For example, you might see rare square waves that look like a giant chess board over the ocean. Or a Sun halo, which is nature’s sign that there’s a snow or rain storm on its way. Let’s see other surprises nature might bring.

- White vinegar not only can replace the expensive cleaning products but can be also used as part of your beauty routine.
- To neutralize smoke odors, pour vinegar into a bowl and put it in the place where you want to eliminate the bad smell. 
- Sprinkle a generous amount of white vinegar onto the affected areas of the garment, and leave it for at least 10 minutes. Then rinse it off with warm water. Your favorite shirt will look like as good as new!

Thinking about dilations | Transformations | Geometry | Khan Academy,"Watch the next lesson: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/transformations/dilations-scaling/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=Geometry

Missed the previous lesson? 
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/transformations/dilations-scaling/v/comparing-side-lengths-after-dilation?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=Geometry

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

Easiest Way to Save Money Without Limiting Yourself,"Money helps us to live the life of our dreams, as long as we’re earning plenty and not splurging too much. While most of us are busy balancing our personal expenses with one yearly trip to make sure we have a bed to sleep in and food to eat every day, many others are pretty sorted with their paychecks and credit card bills! They work as much as we do and yet their saving game has upped the ante.

These practical money saving tricks can change the way your savings account looks. For example, you can make saving money fun and turn it into a little game with levels, bonuses, and prizes! Level 1: put $20 aside each week - that’ll give you over a thousand bucks a year! Or you can choose a small amount to save on a daily basis - and add 50 cents to that each month. January, a buck a day, February, one-fifty. That’ll get you to well over a thousand by the end of the year, with a bunch to spare!

Thai Street Food: The ULTIMATE Chinatown Bangkok Tour (เยาวราช) - Bangkok Day 9,"Chinatown Bangkok (เยาวราช) is one of the best Thai street food areas of Bangkok. Download your free Bangkok food guide here: http://migrationology.com/2weeksinbangkok/

On Day 9 of this Bangkok travel guide video series (2 Weeks in Bangkok) we spent the entire day eating Thai food in Yaowarat (เยาวราช), which is Chinatown Bangkok. There are some seriously amazing dishes to eat!

1:20 Thai Haeng (ร้านไท้เฮง) Restaurant - To begin out Thai street food tour in Chinatown we started at a restaurant called Thai Haeng (ร้านไท้เฮง), and to specifically eat a dish called suki ruam mit haeng (สุกี้รวมมิตรแห้ง), which is Thai style suki, the dry version. It included napa cabbage, some other vegetables and a mix of seafood and meat, all stir fried with mung bean noodles. It had the most amazing smoky flavor, and was served with a Thai sauce made with fermented soy. We also had a plate of khao man gai (ข้าวมันไก่), which is Thai style chicken rice.

6:28 Sampeng Market (สำเพ็ง) - Along with Thai street food, one of the most famous things about Yaowarat (เยาวราช) is the shopping - both for food shopping and things shopping. Sampeng Market (สำเพ็ง) is a long market that occupies a walking road within Bangkok and you can find all sorts of random things within the market - especially buttons and textiles.

Eeia Saey (ร้านเอียะแซ) coffee shop and Kan Kee Namdaothong (ร้านคั้นกี่น้ำเต้าทอง) Chinese health drink - After finishing a little bit of shopping on this food tour, we stopped at two different places to get a drink. One of them is an old school Bangkok Chinatown heritage coffee shop, and then we had a bitter health beverage that was so intense it almost made me shiver. We then just quickly stopped off at Wat Leng Noi Yee (วัดเล่งเน่ยยี่), one of the most well known Chinese temples in Bangkok.

10:51 Khao Gaeng Jek Puey (ข้าวแกงเจ๊กปุ้ย) - I wasn’t actually planning on eating here on this day food tour in Bangkok, but after passing it, I couldn’t resist sitting down for a quick plate of Thai rice and curry at Khao Gaeng Jek Puey (ข้าวแกงเจ๊กปุ้ย). I got my usual order of stir fried crab, and I also decided to have the panang curry as well. This is one of the best Thai street food stalls in Bangkok especially for the incredibly atmosphere.  We continued walking through Talad Drok Itsara Nuphap (ตลาดตรอกอิสรานุภาพ) - a market in an alley.

15:07 Lek and Rut Seafood (ร้านเล็กกับรัตน์ซีฟู้ด) - When it comes to Thai food in Chinatown, seafood is one of the most popular choices. This time we ate at Lek and Rut Seafood (ร้านเล็กกับรัตน์ซีฟู้ด), which is right across the street from the other famous T and K seafood restaurant. We ordered some roasted prawns, and squid steamed in lime juice, garlic and chilies. The food was delicious!

21:56 Kuay Jab Nay Lek (ร้านก๋วยจั๊บนายเล็ก (อ้วน) - A Thai food trip to Chinatown wouldn’t be complete without a bowl of kuay jab tuk yang (ก๋วยจั๊บทุกอย่าง), which is a bowl of noodle rolls in a peppery broth. It’s one of the ultimate Thai dishes in Chinatown.

25:28 Hoy Kraeng Pa Jeen (หอยแครงป้าจิน) - To end the day of eating, at least for main street food stalls, we headed to Hoy Kraeng Pa Jeen (หอยแครงป้าจิน), a place that specializes in boiled blood cockles and mussels. They are some of the finest shellfish you’ll find anywhere in Bangkok, and this Thai street food stall has been around for over 50 years I believe. It’s an amazing place!

30:15 For dessert we had Khanom Pang Jao Gao (ขนมปังเจ้าเก่าเด็ดในเยาวราช), an incredibly popular place that specializes in grilled bread, and bua loy nam king (บัวลอยน้ำขิง), which is ginger soup and sesame dumplings.

"How has the Falklands War changed Argentina, 40 years on? - BBC News","It's 40 years since the Falklands War, a ten-week armed conflict between the United Kingdom and Argentina over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic.

Argentina lost the war, but to this day it maintains that the islands belong to them.

The country's president told the BBC that he will keep fighting to get them back, and has accused Britain of colonialism in the 21st Century.

Hong Kong security law: Life sentences for breaking China-imposed law - BBC News,"People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China.

The legislation came into force on Tuesday but the full text was only revealed hours afterwards.

It was brought in by Beijing following increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement.

Critics say the new law effectively curtails protest and undermines Hong Kong's freedoms.

The territory was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech.

Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security.

Details have been closely guarded and the Beijing-backed politician admitted she had not seen the draft before commenting.

Does Denmark have double standards on refugees? - BBC News,"Denmark has been accused of discriminating against refugees by human rights groups, following its welcome of Ukrainian refugees compared to others.

It has passed a law allowing refugees feeling the war in Ukraine to stay in the nation for up to two years and plans to host up to 100,000 and grant work permits.

However, the Danish government has also been working on plans to reduce the number of non-EU asylum seekers.

Last year, it began controversially revoking the residence permits of hundreds of Syrians from the Damascus area, arguing it was now safe for them to return.

The BBC's Hanan Razek reports from Denmark.

The ‘unknown’ Covid deaths in rural India – BBC News,"The second Covid wave ravaged India as hospitals and then crematoriums ran out of space.

While  cities were first hit, the second wave of coronavirus soon reached rural parts of the country, where hundreds died due to poor or no access to good healthcare. Most of them were not even able to get a Covid test.

Experts now believe the number of deaths in rural India is much higher than has been recorded in official statistics.

The BBC visited villages in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, one of the worst-hit, to investigate alleged under-reporting of these deaths.

DaniLeigh - Do It To Me (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"DaniLeigh - Do It To Me (Vevo DSCVR)

The more skills, the more chances for success. DaniLeigh doesn't have to talk about her expertise at dance - her talents in that area have been known for a while now. Surrounded by music since her teen years in Miami, the 23-year-old singer, now an LA resident, enjoyed an early breakthrough when Prince fell for her moves and had her direct and choreograph his ""Breakfast Can Wait"" video. But DaniLeigh has been a charismatic vocalist ever since she began dropping very convincing covers on YouTube back in the Florida days. And she's only gotten stronger of late. 2017's 'Summer With Friends' EP and last year's 'The Plan' album suggest just how quickly she's refining her command as a singer. And performer. When she hit our DSCVR set for a romp through ""Do It To Me"" and her recent smash ""Lil Bebe,"" she was pure fire.

This Giant Pit Can Swallow Anything Flying Over It,"Nowadays you can get almost anywhere you want by plane. But there are places on Earth over which planes can't fly. They are restricted zones you can’t enter for security or secrecy reasons. Let's explore some of them and find out, why it's forbidden to fly over these places...

One of such zones is Disneyland and Disney World. It's forbidden to fly over the theme park without a special waiver and the restriction goes 3,000 feet above sea level. Another place protected from helicopters is a huge hole in Earth's surface. The giant pit is a diamond mine and it messes with the flow of air, creating a vortex that helicopters might get in... How's it possible?

SUMMARY
- There are places on Earth over which planes can't fly;
- Washington, DC and the White House is a very protected zone;
- Camp David is a three-mile no-fly zone around it and a five-mile-above-sea-level no-fly zone over it;
- Another no-fly zone is the Kennedy Space Center, no one can travel over it if they're flying less than 5,000 feet above sea level;
- It's prohibited to fly over Disneyland without a special waiver and the restriction goes 3,000 feet above sea level;
- You can't fly a helicopter over the mine in Mirny because it’s dangerous;
- Peru has banned planes from flying over its famous landmark – Machu Picchu – in 2006;
- Taj Mahal is one of the most recognized places in the world, and it's protected by UNESCO as the world's heritage site;
- Even though there's no official prohibition, planes prefer to avoid particular regions on our planet. One of them is the Himalayas.
- Another tough route goes over the poles;
- Even though aircraft fly over oceans and smaller bodies of water, if there's an alternative route that goes over land, a plane will always opt for it.

13 dead in Nigeria protests | BBC News,"Millions of residents in northern Nigeria have been placed under 24-hour curfews amid nationwide protests against the high cost of living.
 
Governments in the states of Kano, Jigawa, Yobe and Katsina have ordered locals not to leave their homes - and therefore not attend protests - on Friday.

There is a heavy security presence around the country with nine more ""days of rage"" scheduled by the movement's organisers.
 
The nationwide demonstrations were organised via social media using the hashtag #EndBadGovernance and according to rights group Amnesty International, 13 protesters across Nigeria were killed by security forces on the first day of the protests.

23 MESMERIZING SOAP DIY CREATIONS THAT WILL SATISFY YOU,"DO NOT EAT ANY OF THE SOAPS 

Amazing soaps you can easily make at home without any effort

There are so many kinds of soaps out there it’s hard to keep up, but did you know that you can create and customize your own soaps just by having some soap base? This way, you can then add roses, essential oils and create fun designs. 
One of the most satisfying things in the world is soap carving. And you can start experimenting today with different designs. The only thing you need to do is carve your soap and as you go along, you can apply some water to it to soften the edges. You can carve a little heart in your soap with pedals and wings coming on the sides or I show you a very simple tutorial on how to carve your soap into a beautiful rose. Watch my full video to get some ideas for your own creations. 
Now making your own DIY soaps is a different story. You can melt some soap base and pour it into an empty Pringles container, then you can fill it up with roses and let it dry. Then, take the whole soap block out and then cut it into smaller pieces.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Preventing Deadly Distracted Driving | The Forum at HSPH,"Hundreds of thousands of Americans are injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver each year. According to the National Occupant Protection Use Survey, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving at a typical daylight moment in the U.S. Many distracted drivers are young — 10% of all drivers under the age of 20 involved in fatal crashes were reported as distracted at the time of the crash, according to Distraction.gov. Drivers in their 20s comprise more than one-quarter of distracted drivers in fatal crashes. In honor of National Distracted Driving Awareness Month, The Honorable Anthony Foxx, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, and Jay Winsten, Frank Stanton Director of the Center for Health Communication at Harvard School of Public Health and Associate Dean for Health Communication, explored how to keep Americans safer on the road through approaches such as education campaigns, smart technology, and law enactment and enforcement.

Utrecht shooting: Several hurt as man opens fire in tram - BBC News,"A man has opened fire in a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht, injuring several people, police have said.

A square near a tram station in the west of the city has been cordoned off by authorities, and emergency services are at the scene.

Lyrics

I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising
Open your arms and pray to the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire, or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Give me that rush
I want to show you what you've been missing
Am I enough to keep your other lovers hidden?

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire, or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (is it desire), or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me
You need it now
You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire (it desire), or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire (I want desire)
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (is it desire), or is it love that I'm feeling for you (that I'm feeling for you)?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose (oh, what you're willing to lose)

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Can Lebanon's elections get the country out of crisis? – BBC News,"Lebanon, a country in crisis with about 80% of its people living in poverty, according to the UN, will go to the polls on Sunday.

The capital, Beirut, still bears the scars of the devastating port explosion that killed more than 200 people in August 2020.

The mood is fragile, hurting, and desperate. Many Lebanese people accuse the country's political leaders of failing to tackle its deep problems and many more leaving the country.

SUMMARY:
- Charles Ergen prefers a lunch of sandwiches in a brown paper bag over 5-star restaurant dishes. On his business travels, he shares rooms with his colleagues and never flies first class.
- Carlos Slim Helu doesn’t have high-end tailored suits. He has the funds to purchase private jets, yachts, and limousines, but he still drives an old Mercedes-Benz.
- Forbes magazine reported in 2007 that Jim Walton has driven to and from work in a rusting Dodge Dakota pickup for over 15 years.
- Before his retirement, John Caudwell rode his bike 14 miles to and from work every day. He told Forbes magazine that he doesn’t need Savile Row suits and prefers to buy from the British retailer Marks & Spencer. John doesn’t have a taste for expensive wines, and he even cuts his own hair.
- Amancio Ortega eats lunch with his employees at his company cafeteria every day. The multibillionaire is more often seen on the factory floor checking new products with his designers than cooped up inside a spacious private office.
- David Cheriton flies economy class, and has lived in the same home for over 35 years. Cheriton’s style can be summed up as jeans and a T-shirt, and he enjoys cycling to work.
- Azim Premji prefers to fly coach and drives an old Toyota Corolla, which is an upgrade from his worn-out Ford Escort. Premji has also been seen riding a 3-wheeled auto rickshaw when he arrives home from his business trips.
- Mark Zuckerberg is content with a uniform of a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers instead of tailored suits and expensive leather shoes.
- Warren Buffett prefers a simple and frugal life. He still lives in the same 6,000-square-foot, 5-bedroom house he bought for $31,500 in 1958 in Omaha, Nebraska.
- Bill Gates knows where to put his brain and money, which he proved more than 4 decades ago. Although he is no longer the CEO and chairman of the company, Bill Gates remains a board member because, like his longtime friend Warren Buffett, he is more drawn to his own charitable foundation.
- Jeff Bezos donates to other foundations like the nonprofit TheDream.US. Reportedly, he drives a Honda Accord, and his desk at Amazon is made from a wooden door. He also made sure that Amazon’s other furniture was bought from garage sales and auctions.

The glacier that keeps collapsing - BBC News,"A glacier arch in Argentina has collapsed - but it's not due to climate change.
It's part of a cycle and means tourists can see the spectacle of huge chunks of ice falling off the glacier every few years.
The Perito Moreno glacier in Argentina's Patagonia region is one of very few globally that grows rather than shrinks but scientists say that overall the amount of glacial ice in the Patagonia region is decreasing.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Josie Man - Grow (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Josie Man - Grow (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Love is “all I really think about,” says Josie Man. The London-based singer’s candid obsession dominates ‘Stormy Skies,’ the follow-up to her nominally romantic 2020 EP, ‘aLOVINGboothang.’ Shimmery alt-pop production galvanizes the new four-song project; That includes its title track, which meditates on advancing a relationship through flaw acceptance. The spiritually-slanted Rihanna fan wants her music to spread “kindness and goosebumps” — and that’s definitely what went down in our London studio. These DSCVR performances of “Stormy Skies” and “Grow,” which preaches learning from past mistakes, conjured an aura of positive vibes from beginning to end.

35 INSPIRING DIYS AND CRAFTS,"Genius crafts and ideas to try at home

We all know that hot glue is there to help us fix things fast and make our life easier, but did you know that you can use it as a craft as well. For example, you can do some old-fashioned letter writing and seal the envelopes with real flowers trapped in blob of hot glue. 
Speaking of blobs, squeeze out some hot glue on some greaseproof paper and make it resemble a raindrop. Then, sprinkle some sequin pieces on top, add some jewelry attachment bids and voila. Your very own sparkly new jewelry from scratch. 
You can also make little lightbulbs for your fairy lights to decorate your home. The only thing you’ll need is a silicone mold to shape your little light covers. 
You can also use colored silicone mold and a clear phone to make it into an awesome 3D phonecase with all sorts of things embedded on it such as mini donuts, cupcakes and sprinkles. 
If you are feeling stressed all the time and you want something to occupy your hands with, I show you how to make your own little stress toy on your phone case. Simply create a round ring with some hot glue on your phone case and paint it white. Then take a slime, add it inside an empty balloon and finally add the small piece of slime inside. Again using hot glue stick it back on your case and voila. It will be like an egg, de-stress phone case. 
For your apartment decorations, I show you how to make crystals out of hot glue and decorate them in such a way that they will resemble real crystals like amethyst.

Lyrics: 
I’ve heard all the stories
Hundreds of times
The light and the glory
The wonders and signs
I never imagined
Or dared to believe
That something so holy
Could happen for me
 
But standing here with you
No way I could deny
The God who walked on waves
Sent you to change my life
 
I used to think
Miracles had to be
Water turned to wine or
The parting of a sea
But when I look in your eyes
I see heaven break through
And it’s making me believe
My miracle is you
 
Yeah, it’s easy to believe
My miracle is you
It’s you
 
My words can’t explain it
But my heart knows it’s real
‘Cause my broken pieces
Have started to heal
Like truth for a doubter
Like sight for the blind
Your love shows me power
From something divine
 
Somehow you were the answer
To all the prayers I prayed
I guess that’s what they meant by
Mysterious ways

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything

"Germany to mark 100,000 Covid deaths – BBC News","Germany has recorded 100,000 Covid deaths, a number that other western European countries, including the UK and France, passed several months ago.

Europe is at the epicentre of the crisis, according to the World Health Organization.

The death toll already exceeds 1.5 million in the 53 countries it terms as its Europe region.

It warned of ""high or extreme stress"" in intensive care units in 49 of the nations by March 2022.

Europe is facing a surge in cases, prompting Austria to return to lockdown and others to consider fresh measures.

He also killed his mother and himself. The Connecticut shooting prompted President Barack Obama to call for an end to such tragedies, but what policy changes can Americans realistically expect?

SHOE-MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL MAKE YOU SAY WOW,"Thanks to the talented ZR shoes (instagram.com/zrshoes) for cooperation!

HOW SHOES ARE MADE BY PROFESSIONALS

Shoes are just some of the favorite accessories for girls, though a lot of time and effort goes into making them without us realizing it. Today, I’ll take you on a tour with me to show you the process of how it all starts as a simple design on a piece of paper. 
First, they start by cutting out the fabric and then they go in to give the shoe some shape. After that, they stick everything together and puff all the excess materials out to make the shoes smooth. The heels on the shoes go in last and the best thing is the design. I show you how the shoemaker layers the paint on the shoes and then sprays them to polish to make them sparkle. 
Thought I also show you shoemakers make shoes, and how they polish them with fire. 
Watch until the end to find out some other shoe lifehacks I have for you. For example, you can make your high heels anti-slippery by buffing them down with some sandpaper. You can also use scarfs to make them fit you're better and give them some color. 
Another great trick is to spray your shoes with some glass clear – this will remove the dirt polish them right away.

The great mosquito swap - BBC News,"Every year, it’s estimated that nearly 400 million people around the world are infected with dengue fever, a potentially fatal illness that’s passed on by mosquitoes.

No vaccine is effective at preventing people catching the disease, but what if the mosquitoes themselves were treated to stop them spreading it?

In one city that is severely affected – Medellin in Colombia — an ambitious project is underway to swap wild mosquitoes for a variety that is identical in every way, but with one crucial difference. These mosquitoes have been bred from specimens injected with bacteria that make it impossible to transmit not just dengue, but also the Zika and chikungunya viruses, and Yellow Fever.

Buoyed by successful projects in Australia, the World Mosquito Program is releasing millions of newly-minted mosquitoes across Medellin, in the hope that they will replace the wild population.

And to reassure the public, schoolchildren are being taught to love mosquitoes, and even to breed them — a message that contradicts what they’ve been brought up to believe.

"Germany's conservatives celebrate, as far-right enjoy record result | BBC News","Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won Germany's election, well ahead of rival parties but short of the 30% vote-share they had expected.
 
""Let's celebrate tonight and in the morning, we'll get to work,"" he told cheering supporters. His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz.
 
Even before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that ""step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US"".
 
The other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%.

11 Myths You So Strongly Keep Believing,"Does shaving your hair make it grow back darker and thicker? Since childhood, we’ve been reading and hearing a lot of ""facts,"" the truthfulness of which we never doubted. However, many of them are artifice. There are so many false myths we spread from day to day that it’s about time the world of science created an entirely separate department dedicated to myth debunking! Otherwise, people will continue believing that the sun is yellow, beer makes you gain weight, and that it’s not harmful to rinse your mouth out with water after brushing your teeth. 

Bright Side recalled and destroyed 11 common misconceptions. Watch this video to learn about how some of the most acceptable “facts” are completely untrue. 

TIMESTAMPS: 
Certain parts of the tongue are sensitive to just one taste 0:50
Men get beer bellies from beer 1:36
Dogs see the world in black and white 2:25
Carrots improve eyesight 2:54
If you swim in the sea immediately after a meal, you can drown 3:37
If you pull out a gray hair, 2 gray hairs will grow back 4:11
Your body will explode in space 4:37
The sun is yellow 5:15
You can catch STIs from a toilet seat 6:00
You should rinse your mouth after brushing your teeth 6:55
Shaving your hair will make it grow back darker and thicker 7:30

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- At the beginning of the 20th century, German scientist D. P. Hanig came to the conclusion that different parts of the tongue are equally capable of determining taste, although the reaction rate is somewhat different. After years of research, scientists confirmed the statement.
- It is widely believed that men who constantly drink beer end up with a protruding beer belly. But it’s not the beer that’s to blame for this as much as the abundance of unhealthy snacks that often accompany the intoxicating drink.
- When we were children, most of us were told that dogs see the world in black and white. The truth is that they can distinguish colors — just not in the same way we do.
- It is worth noting that swimming after a meal may cause some uncomfortable sensations in the stomach, but this is unlikely to happen and isn’t life-threatening.
- Somehow, the world is convinced that if you pull out a gray hair, 2 will replace it. In reality, if you pull out a gray hair, a gray hair will replace it —but only one, not 2!
- Let’s get something out of the way now — the fear of exploding in outer space is not something that should hold you back! No, you won’t instantly explode as soon as you step out. However, after about 30 seconds, you won’t be able to breathe because there’s no oxygen.
- It may be hard to believe, but the sun is not yellow at all. It’s actually white. The sun appears yellow to us thanks to our atmosphere.
- The good news is that you don’t have to fear toilet seats as much as you may have previously thought since germs have found a different place to play: door handles and bathroom floors.
- The reason you shouldn’t rinse your mouth with water right after brushing your teeth is that it would cause the fluoride from the toothpaste to wash away. Fluoride forms a film over your teeth, and it helps keep your teeth from decaying.
- A razor simply removes thin, faded hairs, leaving them with thick bases. When they continue to grow, it appears that the new hair has become darker and thicker.

Good Things

Did I take Your joy for granted
Was I making friends with feelings
When all I had to do was let go 
And let You in 
Have I wrestled with devotion
In one day and out the other
When You were always gentle 
You were always good

There’s not a missing piece
When You are the thread between
Make right what’s wrong in me
You only make good things

(My Father) Tell me the truth again
Remind of who I am
Love me like no one can
You always do
Sing over me again
I live with open hands
I know You’re still working 
You’re not done yet

Did I let my dreams go wasted
By finding my worth from people
When you already told me 
Yours is who I am
So I’ll trade my plans for Jesus
Walk in His way of freedom
Everything I needed You already have

You will finish what You start
Your creation is Your heart
You are making good things
What is broken is not dead
You can always resurrect 
You are making good things

Hidden Gems: 10 Ordinary Objects Reimagined Through a New Lens,"Some things only seem simple and plain but, in fact, have their secrets and surprises. Eggplants are called this way because they literally look like growing eggs. Also, eggplants aren't vegetables: botanically, they're berries, just like watermelons. An artichoke is actually an unbloomed flower. Many turtles sleep inside their shells – it's an instinct to protect themselves from predators.

Lyrics:
Un minuto de silencio es lo que estoy pidiendo
Un minuto de tu tiempo no estaría demás
Para que hoy te enteres que mi alma ya no está muriendo
Te equivocaste en lo absoluto, no intentes regresar

Prefiero vivir mil años sin ti
Que una eternidad pasándola así
Fuiste el amor de mi vida
Y hablándote claro no te voy a mentir
Me da lo mismo lo que puedas sentir

Esto es una tormenta incontinual
Es como ir hundiéndose en el mar
Sería un poco absurdo un final fatal
¿Por qué seguirme haciendo daño?
Vivir así a tu lado no es normal
Yo busco paz y tú eres tempestad
Prefiero darme por vencido y terminar
No quiero ser mas tu rival

Han pasado muchos años y yo resistiendo, mmm
Hasta que borré el sabor de la felicidad
Me fuiste convirtiendo en tu enemigo, siendo la culpable
Y me perdí en tu laberinto del que hoy quiero escapar

Prefiero vivir mil años sin ti
Que una eternidad pasándola así
Fuiste el amor de mi vida
Hablándote claro, no te voy a mentir
Y me da lo mismo lo que puedas sentir

Esto es una tormenta incontinual
Es como ir hundiéndose en el mar
Sería un poco absurdo un final fatal
¿Por qué seguirme haciendo daño?
Vivir así a tu lado no es normal
Yo busco paz y tú eres tempestad
Prefiero darme por vencido y terminar
No quiero ser más tu rival
No quiero ser más tu rival
No quiero ser más tu rival
Esto es una tormenta incontinual
Es como ir hundiéndose en el mar
Sería un poco absurdo un final fatal
¿Por qué seguirme haciendo daño?
Vivir así a tu lado no es normal
Yo busco paz y tú eres tempestad
Prefiero darme por vencido y terminar
No quiero ser más tu rival
No quiero ser más tu rival
Uoh, uoh, uoh, uoh
No quiero ser más tu rival",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMhhBRj-2Q
Notre-Dame cathedral: Firefighters tackle blaze in Paris - BBC News,"A fire has broken out at the famous Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris and has spread rapidly across the building.

The cause is not yet clear, but officials say that it could be linked to renovation work.

A major operation to tackle the blaze is under way at the 850-year-old Gothic building, but the cathedral's spire and roof have collapsed.

Last year, the Catholic Church in France appealed for funds to save the building, which was crumbling.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who is on his way to the scene, said his thoughts were with ""all Catholics and all French people.""

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

———————————————————

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown , and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Lyrics below:
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

Well I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Why Beds Are Raised Off The Ground + 14 Other Cool Facts,"You can google anything you want on the Internet. It's full of answers to any questions, lifehacks, or tips to solve any problem. But isn't it so much cooler to impress you friends or classmates with your knowledge even without peeping at the screen of your gadget?

For example, have you ever wondered why beds aren't right on the floor? A long time ago, people didn't elevate their mattresses off the floor. This practice started in ancient Egypt and continued in many other cultures. Why was it convenient? And why do we still make beds so high off the floor?

Meet Anger - Inside Out,"Streaming Now on Disney+ – Sign Up at https://disneyplus.com/

Meet Anger. He's the reason you’ll never be happy that this week isn’t even half over.

Inside Out comes to US theatres in 3D on June 19, 2015. 

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x4lp2X214Y
Why Ancient Structures Are Always Found Underground,"Whenever you hear about ancient ruins, you almost never picture them being suspended somewhere, or just randomly hanging on the branch of a tree, right? In fact, for most of the ancient artifacts we have exposed in museums all over the world, archeologists did quite an impressive amount of digging! Ancient cities had a habit of gradually raising their ground level like a kid adding toppings to their ice cream sundae. But how do archaeologists know where exactly to dig?

Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the most important figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

LYRICS

Someone just told me that there’s no tomorrow
And if that is true I don’t know what to do 
Guess then these troubles are out of my hands
Guess then I’m free to use them to clap and dance
Remember when we didn’t know what to be
I can admit that was somewhat bittersweet
Guess then these troubles are out of my hands
Guess then I’m free to use them to clap and dance

All turned out as great as it could, knock on wood
Things are going just as they should, knock on wood
All turned out as great as it could, knock on wood
Things are going just as they should, knock on wood

Someone just told me to leave all my sorrow
If that is true I don’t know who to be
Could be these troubles are part of the plan
Could be we need the bad just to take a chance
So I forgive what was taken from me 
I will be free from the picture you paint you see
Tell them these troubles are out of your hands

Roma women seek compensation for coerced sterilisations in Czech Republic - BBC News,"Lawmakers in the Czech Republic are considering a new proposal to pay compensation to hundreds - possibly thousands - of women who were sterilised without their consent.

Most of the procedures were carried out during the 70s and 80s, and most of the women were part of the nation’s Roma minority.

Now campaigners hope they are close to winning a long-running battle for financial redress.

Nia Smith - Personal (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025,"Nia Smith - Personal (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

You know a cover song is great when fans are clamoring to hear some original music next. That’s exactly what happened when Nia Smith started posting reimaginations of her favorite songs onto TikTok. She’d echo SZA on the tube, and pluck Miguel in her bedroom. Particularly striking (and viral) were her takes on Adele and Amy Winehouse classics, the Brixton-born singer’s timbre being gloriously similar to those of the iconic vocalists. Under the trove of online videos that document Nia’s rise from classroom jams, to open mics, to increasingly larger stages, are comments pleading for her to get in the studio and drop her own stuff. After all, that is the rightful trajectory for an artist who has had self-described “tunnel vision” on a music career since her childhood. This May, fans’ hopes were fulfilled in the form of “Give Up The Fear.” Tangy boom-bap drums and somber piano score the track, released by famed Brit label Polydor. Its overall sparseness clears the room for the main instrument: Nia’s rich and affectionate voice. The following dancehall-inflected “Personal,” on the other hand, announced her ability to seamlessly slink into new sounds and flex her sharp pen. Though Nia only has one EP to her name, Team Vevo has seen enough to extend the invite for Artists To Watch 2025. When we asked her what she wants in 2025, her ambition continued to shine bright in her answer: “More of this, times 10.” 

Nia's debut EP 'Give Up The Fear' is out now: https://niasmith.lnk.to/GiveUpTheFearEP_

Putin tells forces to seal off last Mariupol fighters - BBC News,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops not to storm the Azovstal steel plant, where the last group of Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol is holding out.

Instead, the president told them to seal it up so ""not even a fly can escape"" and said Russia has control of the strategic port city.

The massive, four square-mile plant has become the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister has demanded that Russia allow an immediate humanitarian corridor for civilians to escape the steelworks in Mariupol.

32 SUPER SMART WAYS TO STORE ALMOST EVERYTHING,"Organizational tips and tricks

Almost everything in your house can be used to organize it. Here are some cool new uses for everyday items and amazing folding and storing hacks.

1. How to use a kinder egg
Once you are done with a delicious chocolate candy and checked a toy inside, you are left with a plastic kinder surprise egg. Do not throw it way - recycle it! You may use it as a travelling holder for your toothbrush to pack it safely in your luggage. Or glue inside a pencil sharpener and use it as a small bin for pencil shavings. My favourite hacks is to use a kinder surprise egg as a holder for your earphones for them not to tangle. Also, if you are not done with a lollipop yet and want to continue with it later, put it inside a plastic egg and close it. 

2. How to organize your cables
Here are some tips to get your tangled cables under control. The easiest cable management hack is to use cable ties. Use cable ties of different colors to tag and mark your cables to make it easier to identify them.

3. How to organize your fridge and kitchen
Here are some simple tricks on how to finally organize your fridge. For example, place all the sauces in an egg tray. Like this they will always be organized, easy-to-access and will not produce any mess even if leak.

Another great trick is to use a wire hanger and a kitchen paper towel holder. You can hand it in the kitchen next to the sink or cutting board. Quite a handy trick!

4. How to use empty Tic-tac boxes
Don't throw them away straight after you have eaten the last candy! We have some great ideas on how to recycle uded plastic boxes. They are just prefect for storing little things like clips, bobby pins, laces, ribbons, buttons or even spices.

UK plan to send refugees to Rwanda is “cruel” and “immoral” say critics - BBC News,"Plans announced by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK to Rwanda in Africa have been described as ""chilling”, “cruel” and “immoral” by charities and politicians.

Boris Johnson said the £120m pilot scheme would ""save countless lives”.  He claimed it would break the business model of ""vile people smugglers"".

The scheme would initially focus on single men arriving on boats or lorries in the UK.  They would be sent on a 4,000-mile trip to Rwanda where they would be processed and, if granted asylum, be offered long-term accommodation in the African country.

The UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to the Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda.

More than 160 charities and campaign groups called on the UK government to abandon the plan, which they described as “shamefully cruel”, as well as unworkable and unlawful.   The policy is expected to face legal challenge in the courts. 

Other critics said the announcement was an attempt to distract from Boris Johnson’s political difficulties. It was unveiled shortly after he was found guilty of criminal conduct for breaking his own lockdown rules, with parties in Downing Street at the height of the Covid pandemic.

Lyrics: 
I see the sun rise in the morning  
And a million stars at night  
I hear the birds they can’t stop singing  
Hallelujah  
I see his goodness  
When I fall down  
And his grace that picks me up  
Every day I can’t stop singing  
Hallelujah  
 
How can you not see God 
In every little thing  
In every little moment  
How can you not feel loved  
How can you not 
How can you not  
Cause He’s in the middle of  
Every little thing  
And every little moment  
How can you not see God 
How can you not  
How can you not  
 
I see the sunset and I wonder  
If He paints it just for me  
Nobody else could make a world so beautiful  
How could I question his love when  
It’s everywhere I go  
Wherever I look I find another miracle  
 
How can you not see God 
In every little thing  
In every little moment  
How can you not feel loved 
How can you not (x2)
Cause He’s in the middle of  
Every little thing  
And every little moment  
How can you not see God 
How can you not (x2)

Everything is evidence  
Showing me that you exist  
All creation singing hallelujah  
 
Everything is evidence  
Showing me that you exist  
All creation singing hallelujah  
 
How can you not see God 
In every little thing  
In every little moment  
How can you not feel loved 
Hmmm 
 
Cause He’s in the middle of  
Every little thing  
And every little moment  
How can you not see God 
How can you not (x2) 
 
How can you not see God 
In every little thing  
In every little moment  
How can you not feel loved 
How can you not 
How can you not  
Cause He’s in the middle of  
Every little thing  
And every little moment  
How can you not see God 
How can you not (x2)

Kara Marni - Love Just Ain't Enough (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Kara Marni - Love Just Ain't Enough an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. You’ve got to have guts to try your hand at Minnie Ripperton’s “Lovin’ You.” Off-kilter versions of the 70’s classic are many; it’s a song of nuance and control, and it takes some doing to get it right. But back in her high school days, Kara Marni took a shot at it and emerged victorious. In fact, it’s part of what got the 20-year-old London native her initial notice in the biz, and she hasn’t looked back since. Our new DSCVR artist is not only known for her amazing voice and skills when it comes to covers (her dad’s extensive vinyl collection turned her on to everything from Roberta Flack to Chaka Khan) but writing personal songs that are evocative and catchy. She’s said that her sound is a blend of old-school soul and current music (of many stripes), and her recent successes like headlining a sold out bill at the Lexington club in London and earning kudos from critics suggest that she’s broadening her fanbase with every passing month. There’s lots of emotional power in her new ‘Love Just Ain’t Enough’ EP, and when she brought her band into the DSCVR studio for a performance of the title cut, that oomph came right along with her. We’re thinking she’s an old soul in a newcomer’s body, and we can’t wait for you hear her impressive spin through “Love Just Ain’t Enough.” Subscribe to dscvr: https://bit.ly/2xmXxc Watch Kara Marni music videos: http://bit.ly/2Hs13Tc Follow Vevo Find us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/VEVO Follow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/VEVO Follow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vevo Follow Kara Marni https://karamarni.com/ https://www.facebook.com/KaraMarni/ https://twitter.com/KaraMarni https://www.instagram.com/karamarni/

A firefighter keeps watch as the wildfire burns a home near Malibu Lake in Malibu, Calif., Friday, Nov. 9, 2018: By FR170512 AP/Associated Press/East News, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/picture/id/68267775/i/119/t/127
Reportage on diabetic feet consultations in a hospital in Savoie, France: By AMELIE-BENOIST/BSIP/East News, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/picture/id/71841203/i/71/t/127
Animation is created by Bright Side.

SUMMARY:
- When a firefighter enters a burning building, they put on an S.C.B.A. – a special mask connected to an oxygen tank on the back. Smoothly shaved face provides a tight and sealed position of such mask. 
- According to research, teachers experience the same amount of stress as firefighters and... airplane pilots. 
- Do you find your profession really boring? Don't worry, there’s something much more tedious out there. It’s dry paint watching! 
- Do you suffer because it’s hard to get up for work in the morning? Hotels sometimes invite people to ""test"" beds.
- With regard to safety, a study was conducted in Germany, in which they found out which profession is the most beneficial for health – it's economists. 
- The Japanese spend more than 60% of their time at work in the office. So it's okay if you fall asleep in the middle of a working day or meeting. 
- It was scientifically proven that red color excites, green calms, and white gives energy, enhances activity, and inspires a sense of purity and... trust. That's why doctors always wear white clothes.
- Have you noticed that some cooks have small caps, while others have long cylindrical ones? This way, the hierarchy of cooks in the kitchen is maintained.
- You have all seen these huge Lego sculptures in stores and at exhibitions. They are constructed by real professionals. 
- It turns out your dog may have a psychological trauma or complexes, so feel free to take it to an animal psychologist.
- Pets have not only psychologists but also tasters. You can earn up to $25,000 a year if you feel that you have good taste and are ready to try such products. 
- The readiness and maturity of Parmesan cheese is determined not only by taste, but also by sound. Specially trained people tap Parmesan with a small silver hammer and determine its quality.

New Zulu king crowned in South Africa despite family feud - BBC News,"After a year-long family feud, Misuzulu ka Zwelithini is finally to be crowned Zulu king in a traditional ceremony in South Africa on Saturday.

The 48-year-old is the son of the previous king, but some royals argue he was not the rightful heir and that the late king's will was in fact forged.

Thousands of people are expected at Saturday's traditional coronation at KwaKhangelamankengane Palace, where the king-to-be will enter the sacred cattle kraal to invoke his ancestors before being announced to both the living and the dead as the new Zulu monarch.

He is expected to wear the hide of the lion that he hunted for the royal event, a key feat in proving he is indeed the chosen one. More than 10 cows have been slaughtered in preparation for the festivities.

U Know What's Up (From Disney and Pixar's Turning Red),"Disney and Pixar’s “Turning Red” introduces Mei Lee (voice of Rosalie Chiang), a confident, dorky 13-year-old torn between staying her mother’s dutiful daughter and the chaos of adolescence. Her protective, if not slightly overbearing mother, Ming (voice of Sandra Oh), is never far from her daughter—an unfortunate reality for the teenager. And as if changes to her interests, relationships and body weren’t enough, whenever she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS), she “poofs” into a giant red panda! Directed by Academy Award® winner Domee Shi (Pixar short “Bao”) and produced by Lindsey Collins “Turning Red"" is streaming exclusively on Disney+ now.

Mexico blames poverty and US border crisis for Texas lorry migrant deaths – BBC News,"""Poverty and desperation"" led to the deaths of at least 50 migrants abandoned in a Texas lorry, Mexico's president has said.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blamed trafficking and ""a lack of control"" at the border - the worst case of migrant deaths due to smuggling in the US.

Nearly two dozen Mexicans, seven Guatemalans and two Hondurans were among the dead.

Those found alive, including four children, were taken to hospital.

The White House called the truck deaths ""horrific and heart-breaking"".

Coronavirus: US state sues China over virus handling - BBC News,"The US state of Missouri says it is suing the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus which it says has led to severe economic losses.

In the lawsuit, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt alleges China did little to stop the spread of the virus.

Mr Schmitt claims Missouri residents have suffered possibly tens of billions of dollars in economic damages.

China's foreign ministry denounced the move, saying the ""frivolous lawsuit has no factual or legal basis"".

A spokesperson said: ""Really absurd. Based on the principle of sovereign equality, US courts have NO jurisdiction over the Chinese government.""

Legal experts have also questioned the move and how far it will get. A legal doctrine called sovereign immunity offers foreign governments broad protection from being sued in US courts.

thuy - u should feel special (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"thuy - u should feel special - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

When crafting a track, or delivering a performance, some artists are able to conjure two or three emotions at once. Turns out thuy has such skills; when she’s really on her game, the LA-based R&B singer imbues a tune with a variety of feelings that enrich the experience. In a flash she can come off as assured, nonchalant, poised, or vulnerable. It’s quite a feat, and it makes her new ‘girls like me don’t cry’ a must-hear. Adored by the singer’s ever-growing audience, tracks such as “trust” and “playing tricks” follow the success of “universe” and “chances” from last year’s ‘i hope u see this’ debut. A Vietnamese heritage and Bay Area background enhance a cosmopolitan confidence, and with a vocal agility that conjures Ariana Grande, thuy has numerous ways of bringing lyrics to life. Like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, pop icons she grew up idolizing, her performances are unique yet natural – she truly communicates with her listeners. She’s felt this power in herself for years; early on, her “Hands On Me” took top honors at a regional radio show’s talent contest, and her yen to be a performer started to take hold. But a life in music is risky to say the least, one reason why this well-rounded dreamer went to school, walked away with a degree in medicine, and took a job at Stanford. That pleased her parents, but the itch to create never fully left her, and little by little she returned to music with a parade of individual tracks, each one catchier than the previous. A few years ago, “All Night Long” went viral and thuy became a thing for sure. It’s been a steady progression since, and proud of her heritage, she’s also become a vocal advocate for the AAPI community. When you see her move through our Artists To Watch performances of “dumb luck” and “u should feel special” from ‘girls like me don’t cry,’ you’ll know she’s not shy about putting herself forward.

Covid pandemic's 'dramatic' effect on cancer care - BBC News,"Cancer patients have told the BBC of the devastating impact Covid-19 is having on their treatment.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans deferred their screenings last year, and many who wanted care could not access it due to the pandemic's strain on hospitals. 

Now, experts predict that an excess of cases of serious cancers is on the horizon.

The BBC spoke to Dr Ned Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, about the alarming trend.

As we begin to better understand its toll on our health, this Forum at the Harvard School of Public Health event -- in connection with a new poll by HSPH, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR -- shared the story of stress as perceived by many Americans. What are the biggest sources of stress? How can it affect our health? And what can we do in our homes, workplaces and communities to help us manage stress and to live calmer -- and healthier -- lives?

Presented July 9, 2014 in Collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and NPR.

Artemis Crew Access Arm retraction inside Vehicle Assembly Building,"On January 11, engineers and technicians with Exploration Ground Systems retracted and extended the Orion spacecraft crew access arm as part of ongoing work leading up to the Artemis I wet dress rehearsal targeted for late February. 

The arm rotates from its retracted position and interfaces with the SLS rocket at the Orion crew hatch location to provide entry and exit for the Orion crew module during operations in the Vehicle Assembly Building and at the launch pad. On crewed Artemis missions, the access arm also provides entry and exit for astronauts. The arm retracts from the Orion spacecraft before launch.",Science & Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76iHzxYJAWg

DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description might be affiliate links. If you purchase a product or service with the links that I provide I may receive a small commission. There is no additional charge to you! Thank you for supporting my channel so I can continue to provide you with free content each week!

In this video, I'll show you the top 5 Free traffic sources I use for affiliate marketing. If you don't use these traffic sources, you are leaving money on the table. 

But you just need to know that Pinterest is still less competitive than many other platforms and the types of content you need for Pinterest are in my opinion much easier to create than for other social media networks. 

And I am actually getting more Pinterest traffic to my blog than I get from Google. And on top of it, Pinterest doesn't require nearly as much work and time as Google SEO. 

All you need for Pinterest is this - either vertical images like these on my account or very short videos - about 5-10 seconds long. 

And to create these images and short videos in a matter of minutes I use this free online app called Canva. 
You can also get a forever free account using my link anastasiablogger.com/canva. And you see I just have a ton of free templates. All I need to do is use my blog post title and change the words or the background photo. Canva has a huge library of stock photos by the way. It takes about a minute to create a new pin. 

Then I hop on Pinterest, I upload the image, add a title and description and the link can be either to a post on my site with affiliate offers. 
Or it can even be linked to a landing page or even directly to affiliate products. 

If you add the actual affiliate link in the destination URL, make sure you added an affilaite disclosure in the pin description. It's enough to just add a hashtag promotion or affiliate. 
But if you want to know all the details about affiliate marketing on Pinterest, I have an in-depth video, I'll link in the description below.

I also love posting on Pinterest because it's a search engine. And this means you create a passive traffic source over time. Your pins if done correctly and if you included the right keywords in the titles and descriptions, and saved them to the relevant boards, your pins have a chance to bring you traffic for many months if not years. 

This is what search engines can do for you and Pinterest is the easiest search engine to rank in especially compared to Google. To learn more about Pinterest SEO watch my free masterclass, I'll give you a link to it up there and in the description below. 

The next great free traffic source 2. Quora and Reddit

Both sites are content rating and iscussion websites with huge audiences. Quora has over 300 million monthly active users and Reddit has more than 1.5 billion registered users, of which 430 million users are active monthly.

But keep in mind that you cannot add a direct affiliate link in your posts on neither Reddit nor Quora, you can even get your account banned for this. Instead of adding your affiliate links directly in the answers, you can add the affiliate links to your blog posts or landing pages.

"Delicious Stir Fry Dishes at Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) - Chiang Rai, Thailand","I have a couple favorite restaurants in Chiang Rai, one of them is Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) - a popular place that serves a menu mostly of Thai Chinese stir fry dishes. More details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/11/best-food-chiang-rai/

Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) is one of the most busy restaurants in all of Chiang Rai, every night, and especially on the weekends, they absolutely fill up with customers, ready to feast. The restaurant mostly serves a menu of Thai Chinese dishes, many of which are stir fried, but they do also have a selection of prepared dishes stashed in the front cabinet of dishes like boiled chicken, braised duck, and roasted meats. During the time I spent in Chiang Rai, this was a restaurant I kept coming back to, just to enjoy their wonderful home-comforting style food.

For this food video, I started off with a plate of a dishes known in Thai as pad yod on tandawan moo krob (ผัดยอดอ่อนทานตะวันหมูกรอบ), or stir fried sunflower sprouts with crispy pork belly. Sunflower sprouts are not all that common in Thai cuisine, especially at restaurants, though you probably can find them at health food stores - so that’s why I was so happy to see them on the menu. The dish was excellent, stir fried with just the right amount of seasoning, red Thai chilies, and finally a few pieces of crispy pork belly to really enhance the flavor.

Easily the most well known dish at Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) is pad makua sawuy (ผัดมะเขือเสวย), the dish that every table that eats there orders - at least I think so, and they should. The dish was basically a simple plate of eggplant stir fried with minced pork, chillies and basil, and the reason it was so good is that it was fried so fresh, served piping hot, and they really got the balance of seasoning - salty, sweet, spicy - down to perfection. I loved every bite of it, and if you ever go to Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) you should definitely order it too.

Next up on our menu, we ordered gai ban tom sab (ไก่บ้านต้มสับ), Chinese style boiled chicken. The chicken, although it looked a little on the scrawny side (it was a breed of chicken that’s skinnier and more like a free range chicken), it has some incredible flavor - not the type of succulent juicy meat - but more like slightly chewy, full of chicken flavor style of chicken. It was served with a fermented soybean sauce on the side, which was a little on the salty side, but nevertheless tasted wonderful.

Finally, to wrap up our meal this time around at Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) we ordered steamed egg (ไข่ตุ๋น), just a simple bowl of egg beat up with some minced pork and shrimp, and then steamed into a fluffy cake. It was juicy and again, just like everything else, it was seasoned perfectly.

There are a number of wonderful restaurants in Chiang Rai, and I think Ja Jaroenchai (ร้าน จ.เจริญชัย) is one of the best if you’re looking for stir fried foods.

KINDNESS REALLY IS SIMPLE,"YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE KIND TO OTHERS
Helping Others Is Simple

We know that you love compilations that are dedicated to situations everyone faced at least once. In this video, we show the power of kindness. Kindness is a very important part of our life as it can save the world. Besides, kindness has a lot of benefits to your physical and mental health. Being kind to people helps to develop a social connection and even could be the start of a new friendship.  
The next compilation will show you some etiquette mistakes you should avoid. You will learn how to behave in public, how to get out of a car, how to behave in the restaurant. Certainly, everybody should learn these rules to avoid mistakes in social and professional situations. One of the most important moments is how to behave with your boyfriend in public. If you are a girl, you should always carry your own bag and you should keep your romantic feelings as private as possible. Romantic evenings are the best time to display your affection, not in public. 
We share a list of important table manners you should know by heart:
-Always eat spaghetti using both a fork and a spoon
-Don’t forget to remove a tea bag from a cup and place it on the side of your plate
-Always fill the glass of wine below the middle to allow the wine to breathe inside the glass
-When you are having lunch with your friend always leave your phone in the bag, as it is considered rude if the phone is on, the table. You should always give the person you are having a meeting with your attention
-Always remember that you shouldn’t put your elbows on the table

Ukraine anger as Putin offers evacuation routes to Russia - BBC News,"Twelve days since the war began, many Ukrainian civilians are stuck in cities under fire, unable to flee the conflict. A promised evacuation corridor to allow civilians to flee failed to open on Sunday.

Russia has proposed some humanitarian corridors that lead from Ukrainian cities to Russia and Russia’s ally Belarus.

Ukrainian officials called the proposal “completely immoral” and said that Ukrainians should be able to flee through their own country.

Chuckles Garage: 1949 Ford F1 - The House Of Muscle Ep. 10,"It’s not a rat rod, nor a drift truck, nor is it a full-time road racer. It’s Old Smokey, the 1949 Ford F1 pickup that was conceived and built by Scott Birdsall the owner of Chuckles Garage in Santa Rosa, California. And while some may say that putting a 5.9L Cummins diesel with compound turbochargers in a truck is insane, to Birdsall it seem only fitting– especially when you want to go 200 mph in the measured mile.

Rafik Hariri tribunal: Verdict due over assassination of Lebanon ex-PM - BBC News,"The long-awaited verdict is due in the trial of four men allegedly involved in the killing of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri and 21 others in a 2005 bombing.

The defendants - suspected members of the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah - were tried in absentia by a special tribunal in the Netherlands.

Outrage at the attack in Beirut forced Hezbollah's backer Syria to pull its troops out of Lebanon after 29 years.

Hezbollah and Syria's government denied any involvement in the attack.

More than 220 people were also injured when a van filled with explosives blew up as Mr Hariri's convoy passed along Beirut's seafront corniche.

The killing was a watershed moment for Lebanon and gave rise to rival alliances that shaped Lebanese politics for years afterwards.

Thai Khanom Jeen Rice Noodles and Curry on the streets of Bangkok,"Download your FREE Thai street food guide now: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/free-bangkok-dollar-menu-guide/

This special Christmas 2011 episode of Bangkok street food is an introduction of Thai khanom jeen rice noodles topped with coconut curry sauce and raw vegetables.

It's one of my many favorite Thai breakfast dishes!

Khanom jeen are Thai rice vermicelli noodles that are lightly fermented so they remain soft and silky.

They are best eaten with a few scoops of spicy coconut fish curry known as ""nam ya kati"" and eaten along with freshly chopped bean sprouts, cucumber, string beans, cabbage, and a few herbs and dried chillies!

Enjoy and Merry Christmas and Happy New Years 2011!",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79WpEo0INuk

Afghanistan: Chaos spreads at Kabul airport amid scramble to leave - BBC Newsnight,"As evacuations continue from Kabul, what about the Afghans left behind the Taliban checkpoints? Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

According to Amnesty International there are already 2.6 million registered Afghan refugees in the world - the second highest number after Syrians. 

As yet, there is very little detail as to how the new bespoke UK Afghan refugee system would work - where they would be dispersed to and how much it would cost - not least in additional funds for the NHS and Education for complex needs. 

A guide to how it will operate is the  Syrian Resettlement scheme, but that was not without its detractors. 

The BBC’s Secunder Kermani reports from the heart of the Afghan capital, Kirsty Wark interviews Kosovo’s President Vjosa Osmani and Sima Kotecha reports on refugee resettlement.

Your Fridge Might Be Full of Fake Food,"The next time you open the fridge, watch out for some common fakes. They often fake Parmesan cheese by blending cheaper cheeses with additives, diluting the authentic flavor. In the vanilla world, synthetic vanillin is often passed off as pure vanilla extract, lacking the complex notes of the real deal. Maple syrup fraud involves substituting corn syrup or flavored water for the genuine, rich sap extract. Cinnamon scams often involve cheaper varieties like Cassia being labeled as true Ceylon cinnamon, which has a milder, more delicate taste. So, it's crucial to be a savvy shopper to ensure you're getting the real deal with these commonly counterfeited foods!

27 COLORFUL CRAFTING HACKS THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE,"COLORFUL CRAFTING HACKS 

Clay, yes I guess it is my new obsession for jewellery projects! And why not?! The possibilities are endless, it is affordable and so easy to use! For this project I combined three different colours of polymer clay and made these subtle heart shaped dangle earrings!

Like most of my DIYs, this is very suitable to adjust to your own taste:
– Make a heart, star, circle, etc, shape.
– Black-pink-white. Red-orange-yellow. Blue-green-purple. Choose your favourite color combo!
– Not a fan of gold earrings? Choose, silver or rose gold!

Make your new favourite pair of earrings in the style that you like best!

You'll need:

– 3 Shades of polymer play
– Rolling pin
– Earring hooks
– Pliers
– Something to create the heart (or circular, etc.) shape. I used a mold that I found in the baking section of a dollar/euro store.
– Jewellery glue
– Oven

What happened on the India-China border? - BBC News,"The fall out from a deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops in a remote part of disputed Kashmir continues. 

Satellite images suggest China has built new structures near the site of the clash, which left 20 Indian troops dead. 

Despite a promise to de-escalate, both sides are accusing the other of breaking agreements. 

Many questions still remain about what happened and why - after no fatalities there for almost half a century.

Lyrics: 

I remember when a long lost sinner
Met a good, good God
I remember when my heart was broken
But now it’s not

I’ve tasted and I’ve seen
You’ve been so good to me
From the moment that You changed my life God
You never stopped

I’m gonna sing it
I’m gonna shout it
I’m gonna lift my hands and praise
No matter what is gonna come my way
All You’ve done for me
I give You the glory
From the valley to the victory
I know my God is gonna fight for me
So when the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord
When the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord

From the moment when the sun starts rising
Till the sun goes down (sun goes down)
I’m surrounded by a million mercies
I can feel them now

I’ve tasted and I’ve seen
You’ve been so good to me
Got a melody inside my heart oh
Here’s a sweet, sweet sound

I’m gonna sing it
I’m gonna shout it
I’m gonna lift my hands and praise
No matter what is gonna come my way
All You’ve done for me
I give You the glory
From the valley to the victory
I know my God is gonna fight for me
So when the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord
When the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord

In every high
In every low
My hope is found in Christ alone
And here on earth when I get home
My hope is found in Christ alone

And I’m gonna sing it
Come praise the Lord
Come praise the Lord
Come praise the Lord
Come praise the Lord
I’m gonna sing it (come praise the Lord)
I’m gonna shout it (come praise the Lord)
I’m gonna lift my hands and praise
No matter what is gonna come my way
All You’ve done for me (come praise the Lord)
I give You the glory (come praise the Lord)
From the valley to the victory
I know my God is gonna fight for me
So when the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord 
When the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord

So when the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord 
When the devil come try to get me
Gonna praise the Lord

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

It took place in a market in the centre of the city of Magdeburg in east Germany. 
 
 Emergency services and police have been deployed in large numbers as local hospitals are prepared for a mass casualty event. 

The driver of the car is said to be a 50 year old doctor who's a Saudi national and who has been in Germany since 2006.

Working to End Fistulas in Congo,"Giving birth in good conditions can mean the difference between life and death. It can also prevent illnesses from occuring that can have disastrous consequences -- like obstetric fistulas. If a woman is experiencing complications during delivery and does not receive obstetric care, a fistula can form. A fistula is an opening between the bladder and the vagina, or between the rectum and the vagina. Close to a million and a half women in Africa suffer from them. Most of these women are shunned by society. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a project at the Masisi General Hospital in North Kivu Province. Working with the Congolese health authorities, MSF offers surgery, primary and secondary health care, and support for victims of sexual violence. Mobile clinics travel to the camps to provide medical consultations.

30 STUNNING DIY CRAFTS TO MAKE WHEN YOU ARE BORED,"BRILLIANT CRAFT IDEAS AND ACCESSORIES USING UNUSUAL ITEMS

Did you know that you can use little Coca-Cola tin cut-outs to make adorable pins for your backpack or jacket? It’s super easy too, the only thing you’ll need is some hot glue. I show you a ton more DIY craft projects you can start doing today. 
Speaking of hot glue, spray some oil on an Oreo cookie to make a mold out of it using hot glue. Then after it dries, remove the mold and use polymer clay to make your own Oreo keyrings. 
You can also use hot glue to make adorable jewelry, such as bracelets and earrings. But you can also make makeup brush holders prevent your fluffy brushes from getting damaged. 
I show you how to make a necklace using spider-print and then attach some fishnet fabric on top make it appear more realistic. This will great for a Halloween party. 
You can take some dried-up flowers such as roses and lavender, mix them up with liquid soap base and make your own natural bathroom soaps.

Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' racial identity | BBC News,"Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists.

Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"".

Kamala Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

PM 'utterly failed' on Brexit legal agreements - BBC News,"The Labour leader used some of the prime minister's words to tell MPs that ""nothing has changed"" over achieving a legal agreement with the EU about the use of the Northern Ireland backstop.

Jeremy Corbyn said that meant she had ""completely and utterly failed"" to get ""legal assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary"".

He said that she was facing a ""humiliating defeat"" on Tuesday over her deal, and she was blaming everybody but herself, before he made a renewed call for a general election and a new government.

We Destroyed the 4th Largest Lake in the World,"For a while now, people have been changing the environment to suit their needs. But in recent years, we’re starting to realize that nature’s resources aren’t, in fact, infinite. If you take the almost complete destruction of the 4th largest lake in the world as an example, we can see a really gloomy picture...

What led to the Aral Sea’s total demise 1:04

Was this lake a “mistake of nature?” 2:52

Toxic desert wasteland 😖 4:48

Can the Aral Sea be restored? 5:54


Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- The Aral Sea used to be the world’s 4th largest saltwater lake with an area of 26,300 square miles, which is roughly the size of West Virginia.
- With the coming of industrialization in the region, the lake started to get really polluted.
- In the 1960s, the Soviet government decided to irrigate the surrounding desert to try and make it bloom. For this, they diverted the two giant rivers feeding the Aral Sea: the Syr Darya to the north and the Amu Darya in the south.
- With the canals dug and the rivers successfully diverted, the Aral Sea began to shrink.
- In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, but the now independent states sharing the lake continued to use the water supply from the rivers that once fed it. 
- By the end of the ‘80s, it had divided itself into two lakes: the North and South Aral Seas. Not only that, the salt content in it had also risen drastically. By 1990, the salinity had reached 36.7%. 
- Over the decades, the Aral Sea had diminished by an astounding 80%! Some part of it remained, but much of the space it formerly occupied became a desert wasteland. 
- The fishing industry that had once thrived in the region was no more. Even the small part of the Aral Sea that still remained a lake wasn’t suitable for fishing.
- With financial aid from the World Bank, a recovery plan did begin in the North Aral Sea, and it’s currently being restored with the help of a concrete dam built in 2005 to separate the two halves of the lake. 
- The whole ecosystem has changed for the worse: a lot of land animals depended on the water and food that the Aral Sea provided, and they either died out or had to move somewhere else to survive.

Thailand legalises cannabis growing and trade - BBC News,"People in Thailand can now grow cannabis plants at home and sell the crop after the nation removed marijuana from its banned narcotics list.

The nation is the first to advance such a move in South-East Asia, a region known for its stringent drug laws.

But recreational use is still banned, even though advocates say the easing effectively decriminalises marijuana.

The government is hoping that developing a local cannabis trade will boost agriculture and tourism.

 I will show you how you build your website and launch your blog for FREE. And don't worry, you don't need to know anything about coding to build a blog. 
I started my blog about 8 years ago, and this decision changed my life and led to me starting this YouTube channel you are watching now. 
By the end of the first year of blogging, I was able to quit my day job. I am now grateful for every day I can spend a lot more time with my toddler and be there for her whenever she needs me, thanks to the flexibility of my online business which all started as a blog. 
In this tutorial I'll show you how you can start your own blog and online business- and it is Free for Everyone! 
You will get EVERYTHING you need UNDER ONE ROOF and for FREE including web hosting, a customizable podia.com subdomain. Something like I have here - see anastasiablogger.podia.com
And the best part is that you'll be able to build your blog on the same platform where you can also sell products, as well as collect emails from your readers.

I'm not going only to show you how to set this up, but I also will show some customizations that could fit your needs. Ok, so let's get into the tutorial. 

To start, you can click on the first link in the description below and you'll see this page that shows you how your blog can look like when you build it, so we'll just click on Get Your Free Account and then just submit your name, email and the password you want to set. 
I'll skip this step for privacy. 
And once you get inside your Podia account, the first thing you should do is verify your email address, just go to your inbox and find the email from Podia to verify your newly created account. 
Then you will see this Blog tab in the top menu, if I click on it, we can check out my blog built on Podia. You see, this is just an example of how your blog can also look like, you can customize the colors to match your brand like you see on my blog. 

This blogging functionality has just recently been launched on Podia, so I've been trying and testing it to make this detailed tutorial for you guys.

Chip & skin: The office that microchips its staff,"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
A new office block in Sweden is offering workers the chance to have a microchip implanted under their skin to allow them to access to various services within the building. A tiny gadget the size of a grain of rice is implanted in employees hands. It then allows them to open doors, or use the photocopier, without a traditional pass card. Chief technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to try it out.

A R I Z O N A - Electric Touch - Vevo dscvr (Live),"A R I Z O N A - Electric Touch - Vevo DSCVR (Live). 2017

They hail from the Northeast but named themselves after a Southwest state. The guys in 
A R I Z O N A honed their chemistry by steadily jamming together and sorting out their direction. From college in Boston to a practice room in Jersey, singer Zach Hannah, singer Nate Esquite and keyboard player David Labuguen kept polishing their sound until it was payoff time. Which is another way of saying that their irresistible “Oceans Away” has clocked almost 80 million plays on Spotify. They’ve toured with Coin, commandeered the stage at fests like Hangout and Gov Ball, and are embarking on their own headlining dates this summer. When they plugged in for their Vevo dscvr performance, we could immediately tell it was going to be strong stuff. Share their performance of “Electric Touch” with a friend.

Inside a Russian fur farm - BBC News,"Furs and animal skins are back in fashion, and are being transformed by top designers into accessories and clothes at jaw-dropping prices. But what do those who buy clothes and accessories made from fur and exotic animal skins know about where they come from? Reggie Yates went to Russia, to find out more about its fur industry. There he was given rare access to a Siberian fur farm, where sable - which provide one of the world's most sought-after animal skins - are bred. There were other animals too, all in small cages and many of them clearly in distress.

I’ve been doing this since 2009 with a few short breaks of about a year. But once you tried it, you can’t get enough of it and you’ll always find your way back to it. 

I’m talking about working from home! A lot of people are thinking about as an escape from the corporate world. Many actually didn’t plan on working from home but the current situation in the world has forced them. And I am 100% sure that working from the comfort of your home will become an increasingly common practice in the years to come.  

These days, a lot of people are literally forced to work from home but something tells me they will quickly figure out all the benefits of remote working. Do you think thousands of workers will want to get back to their office desks when this crisis is over? 

When you work from home, you don’t waste your time for commute. You can eat healthy food and save a good part of your budget because you don’t have to eat out. You can also spend more time with your family. And if you are lazy like I am :)  you don’t even have to change your clothes and can work in your pajamas. 

1. Pinterest marketing strategist or a Pinterest account manager
I’ve seen prices range from about $250/mo all the way up to $2000 per month for one managed Pinterest account. 
I personally went from offering my services for $350/mo to the numbers you can see now on my site it you go to the Word with Me Page. 

I used to charge that per month when I just started offering my services as a Pinterest account manager, and now I charge more just for an account audit and 1 hour on a coaching call. So you see, the sky is the limit and you could potentially make a few thousand dollars if you manage just 2-3 clients on Pinterest. And if you offer account audits and 1:1 consultations, you could earn over $300-$400 per day just from one client. 
2. Translator
And if you think that it’s medium level job, then think again because translators are actually paid quite high for their service. If we go to a site like Upwork which is great place for you to explore most of the online jobs and price ranges, you will see that freelancers in this field are often charging over $40/hour, some are even charging $70 for an hour of work. So you can tell that when I said you can definitely make over $100/day with this job, I didn’t exaggerate even slightly exaggerate the numbers.
3. Blogging 
I said it before and I will say it again: Blogging is not dead! And it won’t be dead in the upcoming years either. As long as we are in a digital age, blogging and bloggers won’t disappear. 
With that said, NOW is the perfect time for you to start a blog if you haven’t yet. Blogging gives you the opportunity to make income by working from home and creating content within your area of expertise or simply talking about things you love! 
So if you make about $100/day when you are a beginner or about 1-2 years in the blogging world, that’s really just the beginning. I’m in this business for about 3 years now and you can watch my recent income report when I shared exactly how I made over 25k dollars a month. 

4. Youtuber
I’d like to include Youtube creator as a great work from home opportunities because I personally see a huge potential of this platform for my own business, and it’s very interesting how Youtube keeps growing and taking over user attention and the time we spend online, compared to any other platforms. 
I can do just 2 sponsored videos a month worth about $1000 each, and together with the Adsense money, that will make $3000/mo. 
Watch the video to see all the work from home jobs on the list!

Saving The Forgotten Jews - BBC News,"30 years ago 2 remarkable mass movements transported this community to the modern State of Israel and now the festival has once again become recognised, much like the Ethiopian Jews themselves, as an authentic part of the wider Jewish tradition. This year as Sigd approaches we explore how this community came to arrive in the state of Israel. It is an incredible story of espionage, heroism and unyielding faith that led to tens of thousands of people leaving their homes and risking their lives. We join both those who were instrumental in the operations themselves and members of the Ethiopian Jewish community to explore how these so-called miraculous events happened and what they mean today.

UK troops’ families reflect on cost of Afghanistan conflict – BBC News,"The war in Afghanistan has been going on for 20 years. The UK officially ended all combat operations in 2014, but now it is removing the last of its troops assigned to Nato's mission in the country.

The BBC’s Jonathan Beale heard from one mother about the war's impact on her family.

Soleimani: Stampede kills at least 35 mourners at commander's burial - BBC News,"At least 35 people have been killed in a stampede as Iranians flocked to the burial of a top commander killed in a US drone strike, Iranian media report.

The deaths led to the postponement of Qasem Soleimani's burial. A new time will be announced later, officials say.

Soleimani is being laid to rest in his hometown of Kerman with millions already estimated to have packed the streets for funeral processions.

His killing has raised fears of a conflict between the US and Iran.

Soleimani was widely considered the second most powerful man in Iran behind Supreme Leader Khamenei. The US saw him as a terrorist and a threat to American troops.

President Trump adopted a tough stance against Iran after his election and Tehran responded with their own campaign. Tensions were raised further last month after the US attacked an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq it blamed for attacks on US forces.

It is unclear what caused the stampede in Kerman, south-eastern Iran, but vast numbers of people were in the streets ahead of Soleimani's planned burial.

Jeffrey Epstein: Questions raised over disgraced financier's death - BBC News,"The FBI has opened a formal investigation into how US financier Jeffrey Epstein was able to apparently kill himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
His body was discovered early on Saturday at a facility in New York.
Last month Epstein was found semi-conscious in his cell after an apparent suicide attempt.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it ""way too convenient"" that Epstein could no longer incriminate others.
""What a lot of us want to know is, what did he know?"" Mr de Blasio, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters in Iowa.
""How many other millionaires and billionaires were part of the illegal activities that he was engaged in?
""Well, that information didn't die with Jeffrey Epstein. That needs to be investigated, too.""

Lyrics

When we began, you could be so shy
But by the end, you became a different guy
And so I thought your eyes were fixed on me
But now I know, yourself is all you wanna see!

Mirror man, no one could love you
Better than a mirror can, no
Mirror man, I'll make it easier
For you to understand
Yeaah, I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth
You see perfection in your reflection
And troubles coming for you
Mirror man, I wish I could love you
Better than a mirror can!

You would say that I'm your only one,
But I would tell you to walk before you run
And I was right and I realize it now,
Guess I'm attracted to the kind that let me down!

Mirror man, no one could love you
Better than a mirror can, no
Mirror man, I'll make it easier
For you to understand
Yeaah, I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth,
You see perfection in your reflection
And troubles coming for you
'Cause all this foolish pride makes you the ugly guy
You can try to change, but you've already lost your way
Why don't you hear what I say?!

Yeaaah, I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth
You see perfection in your reflection
And troubles coming for you
Mirror man, I wish I could love you
Better than a mirror can!",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nplwr5simI

China warns US about 'playing with fire' on Taiwan - BBC News,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has used a virtual summit with US counterpart Joe Biden to warn that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be ""playing with fire"".

The talks are the most substantial since Mr Biden took office in January.

Both sides emphasised the two men's personal relationship and the summit was an attempt to ease tensions.

But they could not escape one of the most sensitive topics: the self-ruled island of Taiwan.

China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day.

The US recognises and has formal ties with China. But it has also pledged to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack.

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

25 DIY HOME REMEDIES THAT MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE,"HOW TO CURE YOURSELF AT HOME

The best thing about home cures is they're both easy to make and effective.
If you happen to burn your neck with a curling iron just put some toothpaste over it will soothe the burn.
If your ear blocked with ear wax, use ear candle it'll help.
If you need to prevent black eye appearance, do the following: pour half a cup of rubbing alcohol, add one cup of dish soap, put it in a plastic bad, let freeze. And when it's ready apply to bruised spot.
When you have a headache you can simply hold a pencil with your teeth. It helps to relax your jaw muscle and therefore reduces the pain!
In case you're struggling with mosquitoes: cut couple of lemons in halves and put cloves in them. Place them on your night stand and forget about the nasty mosquitoes.

Easy way to get rid of the toothache. Mix some salt, pepper and water in a bowl. Put this mixture on a cotton pad, apply to your tooth and wait 2 minutes.
Also find out how to apply Band-Aids and elastic bandages correctly. How to create an arm sling in case of arm injury, cure the minor cuts using Vaseline and bruises as fast as possible, securely fix an open wound, make gauze bandage, get rid of migraine and whatnot! Stay safe and sound!

And don't forget about the special spots in the body that can help you reduce pain and unpleasant sensations in your organism.
Yintang point helps to overcome eye fatigue.
Zan Zhu relieves a runny nose and improves vision.
Yingxiang opens sinuses, reduces headaches and toothaches and relieves stress.
Tian Zhu relieves nasal congestion, pain in the eyes, ears, severe headache.
Shuai Gu relieves pain in the temporal region, relieves eye fatigue.
He Gu, ATTENTION! Should not be done by pregnant women! Relieves back pain, toothache and tension in the neck muscles.

I highly recommend to try 'finger yoga', one of my favorite practices! Mudras can help you get rid of problems with memory and concentration. Deal with surplus of water and tears in the organism. Heal sickness of the ears and hearing. Get rid of throat pains, swallowing and voice problems. Help with weak immunity and loss of strenth. Deal with body polution. 
As you can tell there're no mountains high enough for Mudras! You should give them a try! ; )

I also wanna share with you curious way to get rid of pain using clothes pegs! All you need is put them on a certain ear spot, wait couple minutes and pain will fade away.
And last but not least let's try this easy and yummy recipe for cough drops. You're gonna need some sugar, water, honey, lemon juice, ginger and cloves. Put these ingredients together into a pot, make it boil, then lay out in little circles on the baking sheet or tray. Let it cool down. When drops take needed shape, sprinkle it with the powdered sugar. 
Remember health is wealth, my friends! ; )

LYRICS:
Give me something to believe in
Give me something I can trust 
Give me more than just a feeling
Give me something when my hopes gone 
I’m holding on to you 

Give me more than picket fences 
And a house beneath the stars 
Something rust can’t hold to ransom 
Something I can give my whole heart 
I’m holding on to you 

Empires of flags
They rise and they fall
But You sit above and beyond all I know
Oh say can You see
I know You’re more than an American Dream

Give me something to believe in
Give me something I can trust 
I need mercy like a river 
I need justice like a flood 
God I’m holding on to you

Parties have lines
They claim you can’t cross 
But You sit above and beyond all the stars
Oh say can you see
I know You’re more than an American Dream

Freedom comes and freedom goes 
But who You free is free for sure 
Until You come and make it right 
We’ll sing it out into the night 

Empires of flags
They rise and they fall
But Yours is the kingdom they can’t overthrow 
Oh say can You see
I know you’re better than 
You’re higher than
You’re more than an American Dream

That's Why Public Toilets Don't Need Lids,"Ugh, standing in line for the bathroom. Waiting your turn to a cacophony of flushes, stalls slamming open and closed, hand dryers blowing, and…other sounds. And why are some public bathrooms so stinky?

Well, one reason is that the toilets in most public bathrooms don’t have lids, so the aroma lets loose. Could it be that city planners want the smell to chase you away, thereby speeding up the line? Is that why public toilets don’t have lids?

What ancient Rome’s public bathrooms were like 4:24
Exploding toilets 💥 4:52

#publictoilet #hygiene #brightside

SUMMARY:
- Lids keep you from getting sprayed when you flush! They also prevent stuff in your pockets, like your keys, from falling in. 
- At home, things like toothbrushes and medication are way better off bouncing against a lid than falling down the hole. Luckily, in public bathrooms there’s less of a chance of this, as the sink is usually in a separate location.
- Lids can be icky and we spread germs by touching icky things and then absent-mindedly touching something else, like our food or our face. 
- Another reason we have lids on toilets is to protect our pets. hat goes double for public bathrooms, which battle those germs we talked about with powerful chemicals.
- Ancient Rome’s public bathrooms were simply long wooden benches with several holes that patrons would sit over.
- Sometimes the toilets exploded! These explosions happened because the things that dropped into the toilets contained a mixture of hydrogen and sulfide: making a boom-boom!
- Romans weren’t the first to install public toilets—that honor belongs to the ancient city of Crete. Flourishing and flushing as far back as 3000 BCE, Cretans developed ground floor latrines that flushed by means of an overhead reservoir.
- After Crete, flush toilets disappeared until 1851, when an exhibition in London charged patrons a penny for the honor. 
- Lids cost a lot to replace, and they need to be replaced a lot! Believe it or not, people steal them! 
- And when the lids aren’t stolen, they break! Hinges are a weak spot on any toilet seat and, if the bathroom is busy, hinges get a lot of use—some of it rough.
- Every city has a budget, and spending a lot of tax-payer money on tougher toilet seats is a hard sell. It’s easier to just remove the lids altogether.

HACK YOUR WORK || 26 HELPFUL OFFICE HACKS,"GENIUS HACKS ANY OFFICE EMPLOYEE SHOULD KNOW

Office environments can be a stressful place to be. Sometimes, not because of the workload but because of minor everyday problems that accumulate over time. So, in this video, I show you the perfect solution to those annoying little problems using some of my life-hacks.
If your laptop is over-heating at work don’t worry, you can take some egg cartons and turn them into a stand for your computer. It will help the fans work more efficiently. 
You can stick some pins on wooden clothing pins and use them to attach documents on the office board where you can post important announcements. 
If you’re digitizing documents and you keep trying to reach for the papers you need to copy, you can use a clothing hanger, attach it on your laptop screen and then attach the papers on the other side. This way they’ll always be on the correct eye-level you need them to be. 
To prevent your lunch from being stolen simply place it in a zip-log back and then draw with a green marker on it to make it look like the food is moldy. Nobody would want to touch that. 
You can mix some PVA glue with some gouache paint to make your own correction product.

Lyrics:
Sipping on rosé, sipping on sun, coming up all lazy
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh, as a daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's on me and then hazy
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All the girls vintage Chanel baby

It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, and the room leaves, my click happening, my Maseratti
Said to Barbara, chique, at the super rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah karaoke

It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This one goes out to ladies, at breakfast, in last night's dress
Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and it's Tuesday
Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money
Respect

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do
This is how we do

This goes out to all you people going bed with a ten and waking up with a two
This is how we do
Ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin’ ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do
What? Wait. No, no, no
Bring the beat back, that's right

"Coronavirus: Hong Kong on verge of 'large-scale' outbreak, says Carrie Lam - BBC News","Hong Kong's hospital system could face ""collapse"" as it grapples with a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam has warned.

She said the city was ""on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak"" and urged people to stay indoors.

New regulations, including mandatory face masks and the closure of dine-in restaurants, kicked in on Wednesday.

Hong Kong - which had early success against Covid-19 - is now regularly reporting over 100 new daily cases.

Less than a month ago, the average number of new daily cases was under 10.

Coronavirus: Cruise ship Grand Princess docks in California - BBC News,"Passengers aboard a virus-hit cruise liner in California have begun disembarking after being kept off the coast of San Francisco for five days.

Nineteen crew members and two passengers on the Grand Princess have tested positive for Covid-19.

The vessel carrying 3,500 people from 54 countries, has docked in Oakland.

The US has reported more than 607 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths. President Donald Trump said it had ""blindsided"" the world.

Cases of the virus have been recorded in 34 states plus Washington DC.

Some US politicians - including Mr Trump's newly appointed chief of staff Mark Meadows - are self-isolating after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive.



In Bologna, people are struggling to come to terms with their strange new reality.

One woman, who runs a hotel near the Piazza Maggiore, with its grand Basilica, said she was confused by what the government is doing.

""One day they say one thing, and the next day they do just the opposite,"" she told the BBC. ""One day they say we are in a terrible period, and the next day they say it is not so bad.""

Her business, like so many in the tourist trade, has taken a big hit. This should be high season, but the hotels here are deserted.

Lyrics:
So You catch me when I fall, right? 
And You hear me when I call cryin’ 
And You fix me when I’m broke, right? 
And that’s all I need to know 
So the storm is gonna break right? 
And the sun is gonna start shining 
Everything is gonna go right? 
And that’s all I need to know 

But what if You know something I don’t 
What if You will something I won’t
If You don’t give me what I want
But You give me what I need Is that enough to

Believe, believe, believe in Your love 
Will I still believe, believe, believe in Your love 

So nothing’s ever going wrong, right? 
And every day I’m gonna be smiling 
Turned my water into good wine
And let the good times roll 

Do I want You? Do I want You?
Do I want You or what You can do for me? 
Do I love You? Do I love You?
Do I love You or what You can do for me? 

Sometimes I don’t know
But all I wanna do is

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎

Southern Thai Food (แกงใต้) - Stink Beans and Fiery Chilies!,"There are many regional variations of Thai food, but southern Thai food (แกงใต้) is my absolute favorite. Get southern Thai food in Bangkok here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2011/08/serious-southern-thai-food-feeding-the-addiction-at-lan-luam-dtai-restaurant/

Thai cuisine is diverse and varies quite drastically by region. Northeastern food from the Isaan region often includes dishes like som tam (green papaya salad), grilled meats, and just about everything is eaten with sticky rice. Bangkok central Thai food is also different, with a number of stir fry dishes and creations. Southern Thai food (แกงใต้) is more similar to Malaysian cuisine, with rich coconut milk based curries, fiery chilies, and lots of turmeric roots. In the south of Thailand, seafood is also quite common, especially shrimp, squid, and fish.

So I'm going to be honest and say that I love every regional variation of Thai food, but southern Thai food has a special place in my heart. First of all, my wife, who is Thai, is from the south of Thailand, in Krabi. So most of the time when I'm in Thailand and eating at home, I am spoiled with southern Thai food. After years of enjoying the dishes, I still just can't get over how pungent and delicious the dishes from the south are. They use such wonderful combinations of fresh ingredients, curry spices, coconut milk, fresh turmeric root, shrimp paste, and fresh vegetables to garnish. Along with a range of different dishes, white steamed rice is always present and goes so well with any meal spread.

If you're not in the south of Thailand, and in Bangkok, my favorite restaurant for southern Thai food (แกงใต้) is Ran Luam Dtai (ร้านรวมใต้). This gem of a Bangkok restaurant serves all the southern classics that you can imagine, all prepared and waiting in the glass cabinet to be order and devoured. Everything looks amazing everytime I go, but the reality is that I had to choose just a few different dishes because I couldn't eat everything. While I really love other southern Thai food dishes like Kua Kling Moo (คั่วกลิ้งหมู) or Nam Prik Kaphi (น้ำพริกกะปิ), this time I chose: Goong Pad Sataw (กุ้งผัดสะตอ), Gaeng Tai Pla (แกงไตปลา), and Ganeg Som (แกงส้ม).

I began this meal with the Ganeg Som (แกงส้ม), a sweet and sour southern Thai dish that is made with fish, a choice of vegetable (in my case I got coconut shoots), and a fiery soup that incuded garlic, chilies, turmeric, and lime juice. Gaeng Tai Pla (แกงไตปลา) is another favorite, a Thai curry made with fish innards. The gravy is dark and super salty, but beautifully flavorful. For the third dish I ordered Goong Pad Sataw (กุ้งผัดสะตอ), one of my favorite dishes in the world. It consists of the incredible tasting stink beans, little green colored beans that have a heavenly flavor and a wonderful crunch. These three dishes along with a couple plates of rice and I was incredibly satisfied! When you visit Thailand, don't miss out trying southern Thai food (แกงใต้).

18 Things Even the Politest Taxi Driver Won't Tell You About,"If you use taxi services often enough, you might know that taxi drivers have secrets they don't tell their passengers about. For example, if an airport taxi driver assumes that you're a tourist, they may decide to give you a sightseeing tour you haven't asked for. Some taxi drivers can start the meter not when you climb into their car, but as soon as they arrive to pick you up. 

So let's figure out what things you should pay attention to while getting into a car, why you should check your valuables before leaving a taxi, and why it often takes taxi drivers so long to pick you up.

SUMMARY:
- Most modern taxis already have POSs, but there are still a lot of cars that don't. In these vehicles, people have to pay cash.
- It might not work in all countries, but in some places, taxis have a panic button hidden under their dashboards. 
- If there are some obstacles preventing them from going directly to your destination, for example, heavy traffic or some construction works, some taxi drivers may leave you several blocks away.
- According to this unwritten rule, the only person in the car who can start talking is you, the passenger. 
- If you need to make several stops before arriving at your final destination, discuss it with your driver.
- Before starting your trip, make sure that the meter has the correct settings. Taxi companies can have different prices for certain parts of the day and night. 
- You should not only sneak a peek at the meter at the beginning of your trip but also watch it throughout the ride.
- Don't let your valuables lie around during a taxi trip. Before leaving the car, make sure that you haven't left anything on the seat. 
- It's totally dishonest, but there are taxi drivers who tell you an estimate they know to be too low only to make you pick their car. 
- A fixed price often turns out higher than it would be with a meter. One of the few valid reasons for negotiating a fixed price is being short on cash. 
- Taxi drivers can manipulate GPS settings. It allows them to take longer routes and earn more money. 
- Keep in mind that a taxi driver has to have their license displayed inside the car at all times. 
- Most passengers don't know that many taxi drivers pick up a new ride before finishing their current one.
- Even though it's almost unheard of in most parts of the world, some taxi drivers can try to charge per person. Watch out for such cases and call the taxi company to make sure you aren't being fooled.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Lyrics:
I’m calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations 
I know that You will keep Your covenant
     
I’m calling on the God of Moses
The one who opened up the ocean
I need You now to do the same thing for me
   
O God my God I need You
O God my God I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock O Rock of ages
I’m standing on Your faithfulness

I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly
I know with You all things are possible

I'm calling on the God of David
Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath
But I've got my own giants 

You heard Your children then 
You hear Your children now
You are the same God 
You are the same God
     
You answered prayers back then
And You will answer now
You are the same God
You are the same God
     
You were providing then
You are providing now
You are the same God
You are the same God

You moved in power then
God move in power now
You are the same God
You are the same God

You were a healer then
You are a healer now
You are the same God
You are the same God   
   
You were a Savior then
You are a Savior now
You are the same God
You are the same God 

You freed the captives then
You’re freeing hearts right now
You are the same God
You are the same God
     
You touched the lepers then
I feel Your touch right now
You are the same God
You are the same God 

I’m calling on the Holy Spirit 
Almighty River come and fill me again

2019 Mustang Week to Wicked—1990 Fox Body Mustang Day 2,"Day 2 recap. This morning was dominated by completing the rear suspension. The torque arm is bolted to the rear end housing at the back and a crossmember welded to the subframe connectors up front. The evening of Day 2 ended when Jason and Christian lifted the stock fuel tank back into place after installing and plumbing the new Aeromotive 340 in-tank pump. When we return tomorrow, it’s time to stab in the Ford Performance Parts engine and Performance Automatic 4R70W transmission, at which point the Mustang will start looking like a complete car again. #WeekToWicked #Mustang",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VVmwmeHjog

Prosthetics that 'speak from the soul',"Subscribe to BBC News www.youtube.com/bbcnews
Sophie de Oliveira Barata started her career making realistic-looking artificial limbs for amputees. But at university she had studied special effects prosthetics for TV and film, and wondered if she could use her skills to make limbs that looked more unusual and ""spoke from people's soul"". Sophie set up the Alternative Limb Project and now makes bespoke, design-focused prosthetics from materials such wood, glass and metal that reflect the wearer's personality and imagination, as well as making ultra-realistic limbs. Among others, she has designed limbs for model and singer-songwriter Viktoria Modesta and athlete Jo-Jo Cranfield.
BBC News went to meet Sophie at her studio in north-west London. Video journalist: Alain Gales

Such oceans actually exist on one of Saturn's moons, called Titan. In fact, the methane and ethane on Titan play a similar role to the water on Earth: they cycle through the atmosphere and form clouds that eventually rain down onto the surface. Buy could humans survive there?

My 'smart drugs' nightmare - BBC News,"So-called ""smart drugs"" are drugs that can supposedly enhance your cognitive abilities. People all over the world are taking them in universities, offices and the comfort of their own home - to get ahead of the game. One drug, Modafinil - is amongst the most popular. It was labelled in August 2015 as the world’s first “safe” smart drug - off the back of research from Harvard and Oxford University. But is this true? And do “smart drugs"" actually work? In this film, our reporter Benjamin Zand tries a drug himself - as he takes a first-hand look inside the world of so-called smart drugs.

Artemis II: Mission Overview,"The approximately 10-day Artemis II flight test will launch on the agency’s powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, prove the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems, and validate the capabilities and techniques needed for humans to live and work in deep space. 

The astronauts will launch from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad 39B atop the SLS rocket as it generates 8.8 million pounds of thrust, beginning their 600,000 mile journey. Once out of our atmosphere, these star sailors will conduct a targeting demonstration and check the Orion spacecraft’s systems near Earth before they head around the Moon and back to Earth, reentering our atmosphere at 30 times the speed of sound, before gently splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.
 
Artemis II's crew is comprised of NASA astronauts commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch; and Canadian Space Agency astronaut and mission specialist Jeremy Hansen.

4x4 Garage Ep. 12: Cummins Heritage Center RAM Gets Upgraded | MotorTrend,"Christian is back at Big Tire Garage where he and Ian are cracking into a rare piece of Cummins-Ram history. Since it was originally stuffed with a 12-valve Cummins 5.9L turbodiesel engine to help prove the feasibility of the concept, this 1989 W350 has been a workhorse for Cummins, most recently used to test its 5.9L 24-valve crate engine. Christian and Ian give it the 4x4 Garage treatment to serve as a support vehicle for the Cummins Heritage Center, installing a vintage service bed stocked with a Cummins generator and battery system to support vintage Cummins race vehicles, converting it back from its current 2WD to 4WD, upgrading the wheels and tires, and of course, tweaking the suspension and axles to allow it to fully support Cummins as it pays tribute to its history and technologically marches into the future.

Gaza doctor describes polio vaccination campaign,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical team leader Dr. Naina Bhalla was interviewed by CBS News from Khan Younis in Gaza on September 4, 2024. Dr. Bhalla discussed the efforts to vaccinate some 640,000 children in Gaza against the polio disease, which has re-emerged in the area for the first time in 25 years.

The resurgence of polio in Gaza is a consequence of the continuous destruction of its infrastructure and health system by Israeli forces. The war has destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, forced people into unhygienic and appalling living conditions, and disrupted routine vaccinations—perfect conditions for diseases like polio to spread.

Belarus opposition leader's jailing called revenge - BBC News,"The sentencing of Belarusian opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky to 18 years in prison is ""personal revenge"" by the authorities, his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has said.

She said her husband was a leader for millions of Belarusians and the government of disputed leader Alexander Lukashenko feared him.

Tikhanovsky had rallied mass protests against Mr Lukashenko and planned to challenge him in the 2020 presidential election but was detained before the vote.

20 TOTALLY SURPRISING LIFE HACKS,"SURPRISING LIFE HACKS

If you often use eyewear you'll like these hacks.

If your glasses often fogging up, I advise you to rub some plain soap into the glasses and then wipe it up with a napkin as usual.
When your eyeglasses keep slipping down, take two rubber bands, tie them round the temples of the glasses. That's it, no more slipping down!

If you're just trying to pick up a new pair of glasses or buying eyewear for the first time, don't forget to take the table test. Simply put the eyeglasses right on the table and then carefully look at the glasses' temple tips, whether they both reach the table surface or not. If not, it means the temple tips are of different length! It may cause a lot of discomfort while wearing them.

In case you have high myopia of −6.00 diopters or more and accidentally lost your eyewear on the working desk. Grab your phone, turn on the camera and zoom in on the table surface until you see your glasses.

Another nasty problem every four-eyed probably faced - scratches on the lenses. Put some toothpaste on the lens and rub it in.

If you want rip your own jeans

After your jeans are sufficiently distressed, take your scissors or knife and use the edge (not the tip) to start horizontally scraping the area where you want your rips to be. If you don’t want holes all the way through, scrape enough that you start to see the white horizontal threads beneath the denim’s surface. Once you’re there, you can start using a tweezer to fray the threads. If skin is what you’re after, start cutting the distressed areas with your knife or scissors.

Tight bottle cap

Sometimes food gets stuck in the lid which in turn causes the lid to get stuck. Give the lid a few quick taps on the side with a spoon in order to dislodge any food. Or if it's a bottle, just hit it couple of times.

Growing a pineapple is easy (except for the 3-year wait) 1:42
Why pineapples are good for you 2:34
Foods that we were absolutely wrong about:
- Kiwi 4:15
- Eggs 4:36
- Strawberry 4:54
- Pistachios 5:12

- Apple 5:42
- Pomegranate 5:56

SUMMARY:
- On the outside of pineapple, it looks like it has some kind of scales, which are actually berries, fused together during the growth and ripening process. It has a lot more in common with a raspberry than with an apple if you think about it.
- The name was changed to “pine cones” in 1694, but pineapples, which resembled pine cones to the explorers, have kept their original name to this very day. 
- For the fruit to fully grow it takes an astonishing 3 years! That makes it quite clear why this delicious stuff costs so much!
- Pineapples are literally jam-packed with vitamins and other important nutrients. They contain so much vitamin C, for example, that they can ease the symptoms of a cold or even the flu!
- Kiwi is much easier to eat without peeling off its fuzzy skin at all – just cut off one side and enjoy it with a spoon. You know, like with a boiled egg! 
- Speaking of eggs, did you know that you don’t have to pick every little scale of eggshell from it? Its way easier to just press a boiled egg against a table and roll it a couple of times from side to side. 
- Cleaning a strawberry using a straw? How come so few of us know about this trick? Well, yeah, you can put a straw through a berry and its green cap pops off just like that! 
- Pistachios are generally known to be difficult to open. It turns out they can be easily opened with the shell of one that’s already been eaten. 
- Most of us are so distant from nature that we can mess up even peeling a banana. But monkeys sure know the deal, and they peel bananas from the bottom; not from the top like we do.
-  Stop throwing away the center of the apple! Seriously, you won’t even notice it if you eat an apple from the bottom up.
- Afraid of a pomegranate? I was too, but no more: it’s now known that the key to seeding it is just a bowl of water.

What Is Inside a Ship's Lifeboat,"Titanic has taught us the importance of lifeboats on a ship. Firstly, they are orange in color – and it’s not just some orange. This one has a special name - International Bright Orange. Of course, there is a good reason to use it: better visibility. All the equipment inside the lifeboats must meet international requirements and must be kept in good condition. Let's find out some more secrets behind cruise ships and voyages.

Notre-Dame cathedral on fire in Paris - BBC News,"A fire has broken out at the famous Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris and has spread rapidly across the building.

The cause is not yet clear, but officials say that it could be linked to renovation work.

A major operation to tackle the blaze is under way at the 850-year-old Gothic building, but the cathedral's spire and roof have collapsed.

Last year, the Catholic Church in France appealed for funds to save the building, which was crumbling.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who is on his way to the scene, said his thoughts were with ""all Catholics and all French people.""

"How to Eat Insects, Worms, and Bugs!!!","Here's the article, with photo and more: http://migrationology.com/2012/12/how-to-eat-scary-insects-worms-and-bugs-in-thailand/

Thailand is an absolutely amazing country to visit and it happens to be very famous for it's cuisine. There is Pad Thai, soup noodles, coconut milk curries, stir fries, and then there's the notorious bug carts! That's right, makeshift motorcycles prowl around and vend a bunch of edible insects that are fried up and ready to be served as your next snack!

So in this episode of Migrationology Food TV, I decided to head over to a little stall selling insects, worms, and bugs and give nearly everything a try. This is not my first time to sample these bugs, I've had them a number of times before.

This particular cart had a selection of bugs and insects that included grasshoppers, giant water bugs, crickets both huge ones and small ones, silk worms, and bamboo worms. A small bag of the Tha bugs costs just 20 Thai Baht but I chose a huge bag for 100 Thai Baht, and let me tell you, it was way more than actually necessary. Anyway, after I chose the bugs I wanted in my bag, the vendor sprayed them all with a mist of soy sauce and added a dash of pepper to the entire mixture. She then handed my big snack of insects in Thailand! Yumm!

What to edible bugs, worms, and insects taste like? Well since they are all fried until pure crispiness and then heavily salted, they honestly taste kind of just like crunchy salty snacks - with a bit of a bug flavor to them. The grasshopper was fried to a complete crunch and when I bit into it, it just complete crunched down like a Cheeto would. The giant water bug is a bit of a funny creature, and you do not eat the wings which are simply too hard to eat. You pull apart the body and then kind of work to suck out the juices from the body first, which taste quite similar to scrambled eggs with a flavor of anise or black licorice, and then you dig out the head meat which tastes remarkably similar to mush crab that's gone bad. Next up, there were two different kinds of crickets. The big cricket which appeared to have gone wild, was extremely sharp. When I bit into it, it nearly cut the side of my cheep with its razor sharp claws. It wasn't my favorite. The smaller crickets are alright but give one's mouth a little dryness. As for the worms, the silk worm was not entirely crunchy and I could almost detect a hint of peanut in the body. It was soft consistency wise and was actually quite flavorful. The bamboo worms on the other hand literally almost tasted like popcorn. If your eyes were closed, you would not even know you're eating a bug or worm, but you'd honestly think you were at the movies munching on a bag of salted popcorn!

What is the best edible bug or insect on the Thai insect cart? Well, they all don't have a lot of flavor, but I'd have to say that my favorite of everything is grasshoppers. They are funny to look at and they are also really good to eat. After the bamboo worms, grasshoppers are probably the most crispy of all the creatures consumed in this video (if you heard the crunch!).

So there you have a guide on how to eat scary looking insects, worms, and bugs in Thailand, and just to reassure you, they are all safe and edible to consume!

25 HACKS FOR EMBARRASSING MOMENTS,"TIPS FOR EMBARRASSING MOMENTS


Let's make these embarrassing moments less awkward together!

Imagine you're dancing at your friend's party in a beautiful summer top and all of a sudden your bra slips down! What a bummer! But I know how not to let that happen again! Just place your left bra strip onto the right сlasp and vice versa. 

And if your boots keep slipping down, place some adhesive tape to it. It'll be much more stable.

I just hate when my summer dress or skirt starts flying when I'm walking down the streets. If you've ever faced this problem you know what I'm talking about. Next time before you go out, stick some coins with Velcro to your skirt/dress bottom line. Now you can walk with your hands free! 

Once I tripped in my new high heels and fell down. Hurt my knees pretty bad. Since then I never wear new heels until I do this. I scratch the soles of the shoes with a nail file then spray it with a hair sprayer.

This one for those who always party hard. If you don't wanna get those smelly armpits, pour some vodka on the tissue and apply it to your armpits. Voila! You can dance all night long!  : )

What If the Sun Was Twice Smaller,"You've probably never thought how much the way you live on Earth depends on the size of the Sun! The Sun is a yellow dwarf: a perfect sphere of scorching plasma, generating a magnetic field 24/7. Despite being called a dwarf, its mass is 330,000 times bigger than that of the Earth! And the diameter of this giant is more than 864,000 miles! 

But what if it became a red dwarf? First of all, red dwarf stars are much colder than yellow dwarfs. So the climate all over the planet would be getting colder and colder, and it would become impossible to live too close to the North and the South poles. And quite soon, half of the planet would turn into an icy desert...

#space #planets #brightside

SUMMARY:
- It happened many centuries ago: something went wrong, and our star started to lose its mass.
- When our Sun turned into a red dwarf, it meant the end of life on our native planet, Earth. 
- Sadly, Earth turned out to be out of the Sun's habitable zone. The climate all over the planet was getting colder and colder, and astronomers' forecasts were getting grimmer.
- Quite soon, half of the planet turned into an icy desert. People had huge problems with food and other resources.
- Every next day was darker than the previous one. Dimmer sun meant that plants didn't have enough light to convert it into energy. 
- Since the Sun was becoming smaller, its gravitational pull on our planet was getting weaker. 
- Finally, our beautiful Earth turned into a lifeless chunk of rock covered with a thick layer of ice. 
- With the Sun turned into a red dwarf, the Solar System we had known disappeared. 
- Saturn and especially Jupiter used to partially protect smaller planets, including Earth, from asteroids! 
- Plus, thanks to gas giants, small space objects that still managed to sneak past them got ejected out of the Solar System faster. 
- And talking about the planet humans inhabit these days... it's Mercury. This planet is the closest to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System.
- The ice-covered polar regions of the planet are in permanent darkness. It makes these areas incredibly cold. 
- Don't think that our new home was overjoyed to see us. We had tons of different, often unpredictable problems and obstacles. 
- Mercury still doesn't have any breathable atmosphere. That's why I can't take a relaxed stroll outside with my pooch.
- We live in towns covered with protective domes and go outside only after putting on a special suit.
- We also have to be very careful with the Sun's radiation. Yes, the star isn't as big or as bright as before, but it still emits enough radiation to end your life should you step outside without special protection.

SIPHO - THE CHEMICALS (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"SIPHO. - THE CHEMICALS (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

One thing about maturing from youth to adulthood is that life gets more complex, thorny, and murky with each passing day. That’s why there’s always room for a guy like SIPHO., a just-into-his-twenties musician who’s smack in the middle of that learning period, but has the ability to take a 10,000 foot view of the whole process. “I’m neither an adult nor a child now,” he’s said while reflecting on his mindset while making his ‘PRAYERS & PARANOIA’ album. “I’m in that space in between.” During the pandemic, darling indie label Dirty Hit tapped the Birmingham native. It was a bet that quickly paid off, as his electro-gospel hymnal “BEADY EYES” grabbed plenty off BBC spins and playlisting. Follow-up track “OCCASION” dipped into a dusky R&B feel. It was such a vibe that NBA star Jimmy Butler showed it love on his Instagram. Sonically, you never know what you might get from a SIPHO. track. “SOBER” has a drum & bass engine; “THE CHEMICALS” could be from a New Orleans big band led by Jon Batiste. Rather, spirituality and a self-described “cosmic” perspective links his discography together. Check the cover art of the new album - you’ll see a prayer rug, dozens of books, and a reference to the famous photo of Malcolm X staring out the window. He describes it as a “juxtaposition” of id and super-ego. Heady stuff, but it’s all backed up in the music. Clearly there’s a depth to SIPHO.’s artistry that’s quite rare, and we can’t wait to see what he has in store. For now, we captured DSCVR performances of tracks from the new album, and this first one is nothing short of a religious experience. Stand up, clap along, and find a little truth.

Lyrics:

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened, for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal, is to keep me from falling
But nothings greater, than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me, thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars, for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_weSk0BonM

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains Space Telescopes,"How did the first space telescope arrive in orbit? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice explore the literal rise of telescopes from Earth into space. You’ll find out what telescopes were called before they were called telescopes. Discover more about early refractive telescopes and their issues with chromatic aberration. Then, you’ll hear how Sir Isaac Newton came in and changed the telescope industry for good by inventing the reflecting telescope. Neil explains why Earth’s atmosphere prevents you from seeing clear images from the ground. Take a trip through the space telescope hall of fame as we discuss the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the soon to be launched James Webb Space Telescope. Lastly, you’ll learn why Hubble might be the most successful science instrument of all time. All that, plus, Neil shares why the different bands of light act as different dialects for the language of the universe.

China abandons nuclear arms talks with US | BBC News,"China has suspended nuclear nonproliferation and arms control talks with the United States in response to US weapons sales to Taiwan, according to Chinese official spokesmen.

The United States and China resumed semi-official nuclear arms discussions in March for the first time in five years.

Last year, US President Joe Biden signed off on a $80m (£64.6m) grant to Taiwan for the purchase of American military equipment, via a programme called foreign military finance (FMF).

China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island.

But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.

What is measles?,"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. A person carrying the virus can infect up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people around them.  

A vaccine offers almost complete protection after two injections, so making sure that children are double-vaccinated is vital. In many countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), children slip through the cracks and measles are responsible for killing tens, and sometimes hundreds, of thousands of children every year.  

In 2022, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in DRC vaccinated more than 2 million children in 14 provinces and treated more than 37,000 children with measles; we also supported routine vaccination activities in other DRC provinces where MSF is present throughout the year.

Trudeau denies 'preferential treatment' in ethics scandal - BBC News,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied playing any role in picking a charity with ties to his family to manage a major government programme.

Testifying to the House of Commons, he rejected any involvement by him or his staff in the programme that has caused a huge political controversy in Canada.

Mr Trudeau is under scrutiny for failing to recuse himself from decisions around the programme.

He is being investigated by a federal ethics watchdog for failing to do so.

On Thursday, Mr Trudeau told the finance committee in Ottawa that the decision to tap WE Charity for the student volunteerism programme was made independently by the federal public service.

He says he only learned that the charity had been recommended by the public service for the programme in early May.

WE Charity had previously paid the prime minister's mother and brother to speak at events and Mr Trudeau and his wife were involved with the organisation.

Double Your Reading Speed with These Simple Tips,"Do you have plenty of books piled up at home but no time to read them all? Well, you can triple your reading speed if you follow some simple tips. The first thing you need to change in your reading style to read faster is to stop subvocalizing. Let's take this sentence as an example: ""Emily watches videos on Bright Side every day."" Instead of subvocalizing every single word, try: Emily Bright Side every day. Your eyes will still be able to capture all the words but practice subvocalizing fewer of them per sentence.

Driving With Confidence in Eswatini,"To mark this year's International Women’s Day, we asked women who are leaders and changemakers in Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) at different projects around the world to share their stories. Fikile Lauretta Ngwenya, a driver with MSF’s project in Eswatini, uses the resistance she gets from people who doubt a woman’s ability to drive as motivation. “I feel like they are picking me up, they are empowering me by undermining me,” she said. She also enjoys being a part of MSF and hearing from the community that the organization is helping them. Read more at https://bit.ly/3vFzv9v

"Put Wet Wipes in the Washer, See What Happens to Your Clothes","It may seem like today, nothing’s easier than doing the laundry: you just toss your well-worn clothing into a washing machine, and in no time, it comes out clean, right? But there are several tips that can make your laundry day much more fun! For example, try to put wet wipes into the washing machine before stuffing your clothes inside. 

You don't need to comb the town in search of some particular wet wipes - the ordinary kind sold at any supermarket will do! Take several wipes, put them in the washing machine, and load your laundry. It's a pretty cool trick that can make your laundry results much more satisfying.

SUMMARY:
- Put two dishwasher tablets into the drum of your washing machine and run a hot cycle with the machine empty. This way, you'll get rid of microbes, dirt, and even limescale! 
- Coca-Cola can help you to get rid of blood stains. You can soak the soiled piece of clothing in the soda overnight for the best result. 
- Put a couple of tennis balls into the washing machine whenever you wash your down jackets. The balls will keep the down fluffed up, and they’ll also remove all the foam. 
- Throw some ice cubes into the dryer, and you'll get rid of wrinkles on your clothes.
- Use balls made of aluminum foil to fight static buildup in the dryer.
- Your bed linen and clothes will be a lot softer if you put several neutral-colored balls of wool into the dryer. 
- Corn starch comes in handy when you need to deal with grease stains. Apply it directly on the dirty spot, and leave it there for a couple of minutes. 
- You can use chalk to remove grease stains as well. Rub a bit of chalk into the dirty spot and wash the item as usual. 
- To prevent the colors of your new clothes from fading, add half a cup of salt before washing them. 
- Half a cup of white vinegar will save dark denim from fading. 
- Both hand sanitizer and hairspray are powerful solvents that can help you to remove ink stains from your clothes! 
- Rubbing some white vinegar directly into the armpit stains before washing is another effective way to make your clothing spotless again.

Bryant Barnes - Introducing Bryant Barnes | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Introducing Bryant Barnes | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Bryant Barnes delivers scorching emotions with icy ease. His debut project, ‘VANITY,’ is like an Arctic glacier: beautifully complex, ever-changing, and a little bit dangerous. Those who have explored its curves and edges are left with a profound connection to murky and plaintive tracks such as “Don’t Want A Love Song,” “Adore You,” and standout piano ballad “I’d Rather Pretend.” As with natural phenomena, Barnes’ burgeoning popularity is the result of smaller but equally important moments in time; one doesn’t earn millions of views on TikTok and YouTube in a vacuum. Born in Texas, young Bry spent his childhood moving between states. The only constant was music, starting with classical piano lessons at the age of six. High school orchestra and a stint with the cello further honed his omnivorous skills. Inherently, he began to mix in personal taste. XXXTENTACION, Mac Miller, and Joji songs suited the somber and smooth glide of his own voice. These covers and more exploded on social media. Like most of Gen-Z, Barnes moonlights as a master self-marketer. His airport piano rendition of Hans Zimmer’s modish ‘Interstellar’ theme has likely scrolled onto your phone screen. “You have to take yourself seriously as an artist for other people to follow your vision,” he divulged at the Artists To Watch 2025 shoot. Wise advice. We’re pretty serious about our own vision: seeing the name Bryant Barnes up in lights for a long time.

Far-right Le Pen challenges Macron for French presidency - BBC News,"""Nothing is impossible,"" President Emmanuel Macron has warned, as polls suggest his far-right rival Marine Le Pen is closer than ever before to winning the presidency.

A month ago Le Pen was trailing President Macron by 10 points and fighting for a place in the second round against him but now she's seen as the clear favourite to challenge him for the presidency after Sunday's first round.

Marine Le Pen has led the Front National party for years since taking over leadership from her father.

If she does make it through to the next run-off election opinion polls suggest for the first time that a Le Pen victory could be possible.

My Blogging Tips https://anastasiablogger.com/blogging

LEARN ABOUT BLOG MONETIZATION STRATEGIES
https://youtu.be/SdWuaD0l2wQ 

4-years ago, I started my blog anastasiablogger.com to replace my day job. In my second year of blogging, I made more money than my day job and now my blog makes multiple six-figures consistently. In this video, I will talk about some of the harsh truths about blogging I wish I knew before I started this journey. 

And the first one is that the people around you will likely discourage you from starting a blog…

The Harsh Truth #1. People around you will likely discourage you from starting a blog

When I started my blog, I was still at my day job. A soul-sucking corporate job with a clear glass ceiling. 

And most of the people at my office hated cubicle life as much as I did. 

But when I shared with a few people that I've been working on a blog and planning to quit as soon as my blog makes enough money to replace my day job, their comments were very ironic. 

They simply couldn't believe ANYONE could be successful as a blogger. 
Well, what about you? Maybe the idea that someone could escape the corporate rat race makes you a bit uncomfortable or even skeptical. 

In your case, these people might be your colleagues, or even your spouse or your parents or friends. 
What is the solution for this? 

I could tell you, well, be confident and ignore the negative projections of other people. But if this comes from someone close to you, it might not always be easy to avoid or ignore.

So it might help to work on your blogging project silently. Anyway, in most cases, you could start a blog without changing anything else in your lifestyle and without leaving your full-time job. I worked on my blog on weekends and evenings for about 12 months before I quit my job.

You can also start a blog anonymously. use just a brand name instead of your real name on the about page, or pretend there is a team working on the blog. 

Instead of a profile photo on social media, many beginner bloggers use an avatar or just their brand or logo. 

You can always add your name and photo any time later, when keeping your blog in secret will stop making sense. 

Harsh Truth #2 - Blogging is Not Going to Pay Your Bills Right Away

There are people who are overly pessimistic about blogging as they think that all income reports of established bloggers making six-figure income or more are fake. These people are wrong and losing an opportunity of their life because most of the income reports I've seen are supported by proof and can be easily verified. 

But there are also overly optimistic people who think that they just need to write a few posts and they'll go viral and they'll get a full-time income from the blog in a few months. 

So the harsh truth is that it's very unlikely that a new blog can replace your full-time income source at least in the first year of blogging. There are always lucky exceptions to this, someone could have a previous job related to SEO and social media marketing, & it might be easier for them to take off their blog faster since they know exactly what they are doing. 

But for an average beginner blogger who is learning all the stuff by doing it, things rarely take off before the end of the first year of blogging. 

Solution: don't quit your day job too soon and prepare yourself mentally to see any kind of results at least 1 year into blogging. If you start getting traction earlier, great. If not, at least you won't be disappointed. 

You just have to accept the reality of a blogging business upfront. Yes, you can expect amazing life-changing income reports that you might have seen from established bloggers. Maybe you've seen my video income report where I showed you how I made about $40,000 in one month with my blogging business. 

But with these great potential long-term goals, you will need to keep your expectations from the first year of blogging quite low.",Science & Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h5wnref2-E

LYRICS: 

You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gonna blow up)

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna

We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow up)

Uhh
Beep-beep, bitch move

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, I'm Madonna

Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?

Poured up with my nose up and that rose up in that thinga
I'm froze up, with my stove up, 'cause he eating like it's his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back, cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got 'em awestruck, it's not a toss up, I'm the winner
Beep-beep, bitch move, 'fore I bang-bang with that uzz
That's Miu Miu on my shoes, ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night, it's that pop and urban just right
It's that ""go hard or go home"" zone, bitch
I'm Madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are?

Go hard or go home zone, bitch

21 GOLDEN PHONE HACKS,"Amazing phone DIYs and tricks to transform your gadget 

We see a ton of phone cases online that look amazing, but all of them are missing that personal touch you can get when you make your own phone case. So, in this video, I show you some cool ideas on how to make your own phone cases using hot glue, polymer clay and a ton of other stuff. Just follow my easy step-by-step tutorials. 
You can add little blobs of brown-colored epoxy resin on a clear phone case and then stick a little Coca-Cola label at the back. Then add the case on top and voila. It will look like a realistic soda container. 
You can also turn your case into a 3D abstract painting by pouring some nail polish on it and then drying it wit ha blow dryer. This will force the nail polish to dry faster and it won’t flatten out. 
I also show you how to make amazing marble cases using just a white plastic phone case, a sharpie marker and some rubbing alcohol. 
Another great nail polish phone decoration you can try is galaxy one. Where you paint your phone a dark blue color and then use pinks, purples, and blacks to make the sky and some white nail polish for the stars. 
Watch until the end to discover all my great phone decoration ideas.

At least 10 Palestinians killed as Israeli forces launch major operation in Jenin | BBC News,"At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 40 injured by Israeli forces during a major operation in the Jenin area in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says.
 
There were several air strikes on Tuesday as a large number of troops entered the city and its refugee camp, backed by drones, helicopters and armoured bulldozers, according to Palestinian media.
 
Israel's prime minister said it launched an ""extensive and significant"" operation to ""defeat terrorism"" in Jenin, long seen as a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups.
 
It comes three days after the start of a ceasefire in Gaza and highlights the threat of more violence in the West Bank.

Shamima Begum: IS teenager says losing UK citizenship 'unjust' - BBC News,"Shamima Begum - the teenager who fled London to join Islamic State group in Syria - has said being stripped of her British citizenship is ""unjust"".

Ms Begum, 19, told ITV news that she found the Home Office's decision ""heart-breaking"" - but she may try for citizenship via her Dutch husband.

Her family have said they plan to challenge the government's decision.

Government sources said it was possible to revoke her UK nationality as she was eligible for citizenship elsewhere.

Her mother is believed to be a Bangladeshi national which means under Bangladesh law Ms Begum would be too, said Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.

However, when asked by the BBC, Ms Begum said she did not have a Bangladeshi passport and had never been to the country

Mueller Report: President Trump cleared of collusion- BBC News,"It's the investigation that has dominated American politics for almost two years. Today the full report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential election has finally been released.The investigation was carried out by a former FBI director - Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His 2 questions: did President Trump collude with the Russian government and did the President try to obstruct subsequent investigations into the affair.   On conspiring with Russia - the answer was no. President Trump was cleared of that but on the question of obstruction, the report didn't reach a conclusion.

2016 Super Street Show Car Shootout! - Tuner Battle Week 2016 Ep. 2,"The Show Car Shootout challenges some of the sharpest and most pampered trailer queen tuner cars to compete on the road course and dynamometer. This year’s call for entries netted everything from a V-8-engine swapped BMW 135i to multiple Honda S2000s and Mitsubishi EVO 10s, to classic iconic machinery like an original Acura NSX and JDM Nissan R32 Skyline GT-R. All ran a set of Continental’s new Ultra High Performance (UHP) ExtremeContact Sport tires to tackle Streets of Willow Springs’ 1.6-mile, 14-turn circuit and the wind tunnel dyno at World Motorsports over the course of two days. Which car had all the right stuff? Which one could walk he walk, not just talk the talk? You’ll have to watch and see. 

Catch every episode of Tuner Battle Week 2016 on the Motor Trend Channel December 26th through December 30th with a new video premiering each day!

LETRA:

Qué bien se ve
Me trae loco su figura
Ese trajecito corto le queda bien
Combinado con su lipstick color café

Qué bien se ve
Me hipnotiza su cintura
Cuando baila hasta los dioses la quieren ver
Ya no perderé más tiempo, me acercaré

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

Permíteme bailar contigo esta pieza
Entre todas las mujeres se resalta tu belleza
Me encanta tu firmeza, te mueves con destreza
Muévete, muévete, muévete

Muy rica, latina, estás llena de vida
Sube las dos manos, dale pa´ arriba
¿Dónde están las solteras y las que no, también?
Sin miedo muévete, muévete, muévete

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

Baila conmigo
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
I know you like it when I take you to the club
I know you like this reggaetón lento
This is happend baby till I say so
Come get come get some more

Es imposible atrasar las horas
Cada minuto contigo es un sueño
Quisiera ser su confidente

¿Por qué no te atreves y lo hacemos ahora?
No te pongas tímida
Estamos tú y yo a solas

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?""
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

Muévete, muévete
Báilalo, báilalo
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Muévete, muévete
Báilalo, báilalo
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

¿Que quiénes somos?
¡CNCO!

Qué bien se ve
Me trae loco su figura
Ese trajecito corto le queda bien
Combinado con su lipstick color café
Qué bien se ve

On board an inflatable running parallel to the giant factory ship, Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner Sakyo Noda held the Japanese kanji symbol ""偽"" (""nise""), meaning ""fake"", next to the word ""RESEARCH"" which has been painted by the Japanese Fisheries Agency on the Nishim Maru's hull.
Reflecting a growing disquiet in Japanese society, ""偽"" was voted the best kanji symbol of the year for 2008. Its choice reflects recent food mislabeling scandals, problems over political funds and faulty pension records.
Greenpeace Japan is now using it to show that the use of taxpayers money to fund ""scientific"" whaling is yet another government scandal.

WHO ARE KARA AND NATE?!  - We decided to take a year off to travel the world in January 2016. Daily vlogging was not the original plan, but we quickly fell in love with it and now post a video of what we do every day! About halfway through the year, we knew we weren’t going to be ready to stop traveling in December, so now we have a new goal of visiting 100 countries before 2019! On our channel you can expect to see the best foods and adventures of every country we visit ;)

New Life Hacks I Just Discovered and Can't Live Without,"Did you know ketchup is super versatile and can be used for more than just fries? For instance, you can use it to remove rust thanks to its acidity, which breaks down the rust on surfaces. It also works wonders on copper and brass, helping to remove tarnish and bring back their shine. Plus, ketchup can act as a natural meat tenderizer, breaking down the fibers to make your meat more tender. Who knew this common condiment could do so much?

What If You Changed Your Bones to Metal,"Have you ever thought of what the world is going to be like in 20 years? For example, will it be possible to have metal bones? And what would happen if our bones were replaced with metal? Let's imagine the future has arrived. Cyborgs walk the streets, cars fly between skyscrapers, nano-computers are embedded in people’s brains, and the human body is almost invulnerable. Music has also helped as well. The cyber era came about very quickly thanks to a crazy and fearless rock musician who turned his bones into metal. 

By 2040, doctors have already learned to make complex changes to people’s bodies. But no one has dared to replace an entire skeleton with metal. They’re afraid to even try. Metal is an alien substance, and people assume the patient’s body would just reject it. The world needs someone who has enough courage to try. Meet Mel Metal, the lead singer of the world-famous metal band ""Iron Heart"". He lost his popularity many years ago. Mel wants to do something so unusual that the world will remember him forever. One evening, he comes up with the idea to replace his bones with metal.

Donald Trump and his Republican allies have made immigration a focal point of their criticism for Harris, calling her a “failed border tsar”.

How sensors could show you how fresh your food is - BBC News,"Australian scientists are developing a sensor that gives real-time information about how fresh your food is.

People can see if products are ok to eat by checking the colour of the sensors on the packaging.

It it's blue it's fine, purple means the food should be eaten soon, while red warns you the product has gone bad and shouldn't be consumed.

If successful, the scientists hope it could help reduce the huge global problem of household food waste.

World’s largest carbon dioxide sucking factory opens in Iceland - BBC News,"The world’s largest factory to capture carbon dioxide from the air has begun operations in Iceland. Reducing the amount of CO₂ in the Earth’s atmosphere would help reduce the effects of climate change.
 
It showcases a developing technology considered by some to be an important tool in the fight against climate change but sceptics question how much impact it can really have.                                                                                                       
Is it a futuristic vision of how to save the planet from runaway climate change, or a futile expense that distracts from the urgency of slashing co2 emissions?
 
According to the companies that constructed the plant, Climeworks and Carbfix, when operating at capacity the plant will draw 4,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the air every year.

WATCH THIS IF YOU THINK YOU'RE UNLUCKY,"THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO CLUMSY PEOPLE

We prepared a new collection of fails that usually happen to clumsy (or unlucky?) people. I bet you have at least one clumsy friend! Or maybe some situations usually happen with you? To tell the truth, fails may happen with any person and especially when they are too tired or stressed out. Usually, tired people tend to forget something or lose, for example, phones. One more fail is when you have prepared a delicious sandwich for breakfast and it falls to the floor. Fail! You always have a lot of bruises and when friends ask you how you got this bruise you can’t even imagine. Moreover, you usually find yourself spilling or breaking something. A kitchen is a dangerous place for you as you usually burn something or can’t open everything without getting everything all over the kitchen.   
 Also, we share a lot of summer lifehacks that will ease your life! Do you love to wear dresses? If yes you have faced at least once with problem when the wind blows up your skirt in a very inappropriate moment. Don’t worry we know how to solve this annoying problem. Attach coins to the skirt using band-aid. You can use a coffee filter to blot your skin and get rid of sweat. We choose coffee filters as they have high absorbing properties. Use tomato slices to cure sunburn! Tomatoes have a healing effect that speeds up skin regeneration. Make a mosquito repellent using lemons and tea tree oil. Check out the tutorial. Have you ever noticed that when it’s very hot your skin sometimes sticks to the chair and it’s really hard or even painfully to get up? You can solve this problem by using a spray deodorant.

Lyrics:
I’m coming with a heart of worship
I’m bringing in a brand new song
I’m ready to see the unthinkable
I’m ready for a miracle

Hearts praying for a fresh encounter
Souls looking to the living god
I’m ready for a real revival
O Holy Spirit come

Come like a flood
Like a fire
Holy spirit
Fall in this place
Fill our hearts
O Holy Spirit come

We’re on the edge of a new beginning
God We know you have so much more
We’re looking to a new horizon
We’re praying for your rain to pour

An overflowing of true redemption 
An overflowing of your kingdom
We’re ready for a real revival
Holy Spirit come

Oh can you feel it
Heaven is reaching
Oh can you hear it
Our God is speaking
Oh can you see it
He’s got your healing
Just receive it
Receive the freedom",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7npYkaJ8kWc

12 Tips on How to Spot Fake Jewelry,"Here are 12 simple ways to spot counterfeit jewelry. You can check your jewelry at home or even use some of these methods right there in the store before you hand over your hard-earned cash!

SUMMARY:
- It’s super easy to find information about which hallmarks are typical for different metals online. All you have to do is compare the information from the Internet with the engraving on your jewelry item.
- A genuine item of jewelry with a high content of precious metal won’t stick to a magnet. That's why you can take out that magnet you've brought with you and figure out if you're being offered the real deal or not.
- Real gold leaves golden traces on unburnt and unglazed ceramic tiles or porcelain, while the traces from counterfeits are usually gray or black.
- A simple method to check your silver is to use chalk. If it starts to darken when you rub it in chalk, it’s real!
- You can check gold with iodine. If there’s a stain left on the item after the test, it's an obvious sign of a fake or a really low content of precious metal. 
- Another way to check gold is the vinegar test. Fake or impure gold darkens in vinegar very quickly.
- If the item is made of real silver, then the place where you apply the ointment will become dark blue. And don’t worry about ruining your jewelry this way.
- Ammonia is a good way to check if the item you have is real platinum. When it interacts with most metals, ammonia causes the surface to blacken.
- A real diamond won’t fog up when you breathe hot air on it because it has a high thermal conductivity.
- In order to determine the authenticity of an emerald, you should examine the structure of the gem under a magnifying glass. A genuine emerald doesn't have tubular or spiral patterns inside.
- In order to determine the authenticity of a pearl, it’ll be enough to check it with your teeth. If you try to bite a pearl, you'll feel that it creaks like sand.
- Place a piece of amber into a glass of salty water. An item made of glass or plastic, as well as fake amber made of epoxy resin, will sink instantly.

Pink Floyd reunite for Ukraine protest song - BBC News,"Pink Floyd have reunited to record their first new material in 28 years, a protest song against the Ukraine war.
 
The song is built around a spine-tingling refrain from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox who had played as backing band for Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour in the past.

Gilmour says the song is a show of ""anger at a superpower invading a peaceful nation"".
But it is also intended as a morale booster for the people of Ukraine, and a call ""for peace"".

Proceeds from the single will go to humanitarian relief.

South Korea's parliament votes to block martial law | BBC News,"Lawmakers in South Korea have voted to block the president's move to declare martial law, after both the ruling party and opposition vowed to obstruct the declaration.
 
The resolution requesting the lifting of martial law was passed with 190 of 300 members in attendance, with all present in favour.
 
President Yoon Suk Yeol had declared emergency martial law in the country in a surprise late night television address, calling it necessary to protect the country from North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements.
 
Large crowds have been clashing with police outside the South Korean National Assembly since the unexpected announcement.
 
Martial law means rule by military authorities in a time of emergency, and can mean the suspension of normal civil rights.

You can grind some aloe Vera leaves in the blender, mix them up with some liquid soap base and then let them cool down. You can carve them up in squares and voila – You’ve made your own soaps that can benefit your skin too. 
You can also melt some soap base and pour it in a container with bubble wrap at the bottom. Then, pour some honey in the mixture and let it dry. Your soap will look like real honeycombs. 
If you put a store-bought rectangular soap in the microwave for a few seconds, it will expand and become a huge blob. You can use it in your bathroom and have your guests cut little pieces from it to wash their hands. 
Alternatively, you can take a Pringles container and fill it up with roses, then you can pour some liquid soap base on top and once it dries cut it up in smaller soap bars. 
For your soap gifts, use a peeler to slice off a layer of a rectangular soap and then roll it in your hands to turn in into little roses that will decorate the present. 
For those who love crystals, take a somewhat transparent soap and cut it up in smaller pieces. Then, add it in a plastic cup and then fill it up with a clear soap base. After it dries, cut uneven pieces off it and voila.

"Star Trek's William Shatner on ""unbelievable"" experience in Space - BBC News","William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, has become the oldest person to go to space, at the age of 90.

His trip on the rocket system - developed by Amazon[.]com founder Jeff Bezos - lasted about 10 minutes.

The actor, and three others who were aboard, got to experience a short period of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth through the capsule's big windows.

When he landed back on Earth in the Texas desert William Shatner told Mr Bezos ""Everybody in the world needs to do this… It was unbelievable"".

The new virtual country with no borders - BBC News,"If you were to create your own country, you might think about a territory, language and passports. Simon Anholt and Madeline Hung have taken a different approach. When they launched the Good Country in September, they ditched notions of national identity and focused instead on the international interest.
In the current climate of aggression and competition between countries and their leaders, the Good Country aspires to change the way that nations interact. Their research suggests that 10% of the world’s population could share their world view. Based on that, they aim to recruit 760 million “citizens of the world” and use the power of the masses to fix some of the world’s problems.
Is the Good Country a game changer or just a romantic daydream?

Lyrics: 

You got me tripping on love 
Too late, too late 
Trying to give some kind of respect 
Too late, too late 
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you 
You lost a diamond baby 
 
Wait wait wait
Now what you say 
Said I heard you say something like 
Let’s talk it through 
But there’s nothing more that you can do 

Cause it’s your mistake
I guess lipstick stains, and that’s okay but we’re through 
But you don’t hear I’m over you 

Maybe this is something you think crazy loved young lovers do 
(Crazy loved young lovers do)
But I’ll be on my way to some party tonight 
Without you 

You said it too late
You got me tripping on love
Too late, too late 
You said it too late
Trying to give some kind of respect
Too late, too late   
Ohhh
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you
You lost a diamond baby  
Oh yeah 

You said it too late
ooo I said 
You got me tripping on love 
Too late, too late 
You said it too late
I’m going somewhere tonight
Don’t wait, don’t wait
Ohhh
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you
You lost a diamond baby  

Wait wait wait
Now what you say
Cause I swear you called a thousand times yesterday 
Cause you can’t watch me walk away 

It’s your mistakes 
The foolish games you tried to play that I won’t play 
So there’s nothing left for me to say 

Maybe this is something you think crazy loved young lovers do 
(Crazy loved young lovers do)
But I’ll be on my way to some party tonight 
Without you 

You said it too late
You got me tripping on love 
Too late, too late 
You said it too late
Trying to give some kind of respect
Too late, too late   
Ohhh
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you
You lost a diamond baby  
Oh yeah 

You said it too late
ooo I said 
You got me tripping on love 
Too late, too late 
You said it too late
I’m going somewhere tonight
Don’t wait, don’t wait
Ohhh
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you
You lost a diamond baby  
ooo I said 

I’ll be there at that party tonight without you 
Cause you don’t know what love is 
I’ll be holding somebody tonight that ain’t you 

You said it too late
You got me tripping on love 
Too late, too late 
You said it too late
Trying to give some kind of respect
Too late, too late   
Ohhh
I am an island baby 
Do you think that I need you
I don’t need you
You lost a diamond baby

It suggests the country is still capable of developing weapons despite food shortages and an economic crisis.

Japan said it had ""significant concerns"" and the US military said the tests posed threats to the international community.

Violence is surging in Afghanistan, even as the government is holding peace talks with the Taliban, and foreign troops are withdrawing.

Ramón Vega - BeSos aL vIEnTo :( (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Ramón Vega - “BeSos aL vIEnTo :(“ - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

Ramón Vega es el miembro más joven de la clase DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023. De hecho, con tan sólo 16 años, el cantante mexicano es uno de los escogidos de ATW más jóvenes en la historia de nuestra serie. Pero, ¿cómo llegó hasta aquí? Empecemos con su talento. Ramón no sólo posee una voz delicada de alto registro, sino que también es un artista multidisciplinario que escribe, compone, y produce su música. Este último detalle es importante para la próxima razón por la cual apoyamos con gusto al cantante: la música del tipo no conoce las barreras de los géneros. Partículas atómicas de trap, R&B, música regional mexicana y synth pop chocan a través de toda su discografía. Para escuchar la evidencia de la fuerza de sus experimentos, chequea ‘La Nueva R’. Ideado por Ramón y su hermano en su habitación durante la cuarentena, el EP del 2021 generó muchísima atención ya que presentaba una voz Latine fresca y con mucho star appeal. Con aires de disco de los 70, “Tírame un Hello” es la canción para comenzar la fiesta con todo. En cambio, “El Sonorense” encuentra a Ramón rapeando encima de una cama de synths oscuros. Pero es la canción de apertura del proyecto, “Romántico”, la que en realidad demuestra la ambición del sonorense –fusionar el acordeón norteño con los 808s poperos. Hemos cubierto demasiado material aquí. Ramón trajo “BeSos aL vIEnTo :(“ y “BeSos “eScoRpiÓn :)” a nuestro nuevo DSCVR set. Sus fans están respondiendo a la canción y es muy fácil saber por qué. Como diría Ramón, los resultados son :)

Ramón Vega is the youngest member of our DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023 class. At 16, the Mexican singer is actually one of our youngest ATW choices ever. Which begs the question: how’d he get here? Start with the talent. Not only does Ramón possess a delicate, high-register voice, he’s a multi-hyphenate artist who writes, plays and produces. That last detail is important to the next reason behind our support: dude’s music knows no genre boundaries. Atomic particles of trap, R&B, regional Mexican, and synth pop collide throughout his discography. To hear evidence of his experiments’ strength, look to ‘La Nueva R.’ Concocted by Ramón and his brother in their bedroom during the lockdown, the 2021 EP earned lots of attention by presenting a fresh Latine voice with tons of star appeal. “Tírame Un Hello” is a disco-tinged party starter. “El Sonorense” finds him rapping over moody synths. Project opener “Romántico” really shows off his ambition: fusing regional Norteño accordion with pop 808s. There’s lots of ground being covered here. Ramon brought ““BeSos aL vIEnTo :(“ and “eScoRpiÓn :)” to our brand new DSCVR set. Fans are really responding to the latter Michelle Maciel collab, and it's easy to see why. As the singer might put it, the results are :)

LYRICS:
Some people tell me they don’t recognize me
They say the man I used to be ain’t here
They wonder how I got this joy and where it’s from
They can’t help but want some, it’s clear
 
I just tell the story bout the God who set me free
I just tell the story and how it makes me wanna sing
 
Hallelujah, say Amen
Devil had me in the grave, Jesus told him think again
Hallelujah, that’s what I said
Cause I’m a born again, resurrected sinner been forgiven
Yes I am (Yes I am)
Yes I am (Yes I am)
I’m a born again, resurrected sinner been forgiven
Yes I am
 
You might be standing there exactly where I was
Scared and lost and on the run, that’s fine
Cause I’ll introduce you to somebody who can change 
Any heart that comes His way like he did mine
 
I just tell the story bout the God who sets us free
 
I’ve been bought by the blood
Born again, yes I am
I’ve been washed in the water
Born again, yes I am

14 Popular 'Facts' That Are Completely Wrong,"Have you ever believed something only to find out it was a myth? There’re numerous facts in this world that we think are real. But then they result being lies! The dark side of the Moon, the wetter water firefighters use or bugs in strawberry Frappuccino - have you ever heard any of these facts before? Let's find out if they're myths or real things...

For example, did you know that our planet isn’t round? Its shape even has a special name to it: geoid. I’m gonna show you what it looks like, but one thing is for sure: the Earth spins at a mind-blowing speed, making it a bit elongated, true, but the tectonic plates moving inside it also affect its shape.

SOAP SATISFACTION || 22 MAGICAL DIY SOAP IDEAS,"Brilliant soap DIY’s and crafts with soaps 

Everybody likes to have a scented soap in their bathroom or kitchen. Though, not all of the soap bars look very unique. Well, in this video I show you how to create your own adorable soaps from scratch that you can give them to your loved ones as gifts. 
You can make a mold using kitchen foil and melt some soap base inside. Then, you add a few drops of white dye and then you create a yellow soap egg yolk to add in the middle. This way you can create a fried egg soap bar. 
You can embed some toys inside a soap bar to encourage your kids to wash their hands. 
Another great soap trick is to add some bubble wrap paper inside a baking tray and then pour some liquid soap on top. You can mix some honey in the mixture to give it a natural organic smell. Then, let the soap dry and cut it in smaller pieces. It will look exactly like a honeycomb
For those of you who like oddly satisfying soap carving videos, I show you how to turn a boring soap bar into amazing creations using just a small knife. You can wet the soap bar while you sculpt it to help it get a more natural-looking shape.
Watch until the end to see how to make your own mini watermelon soap bars and how to add flowers to your soaps.

"No, your Covid jab isn't magnetic - BBC News","Videos of people sticking magnets to where they claim they've had the Covid vaccine have racked up millions of views on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

Some people say there must be something magnetic in the vaccines and others have gone further to say it’s proof of a microchip - a theory which just isn’t true.

SUMMARY:
- After all that fun and utter joy is out of your system, you start asking yourself “what’s next?” Well, maybe it’s time to try and figure out what really happened and why everyone just disappeared? 
- The first thing you need to figure out is food and drinking water. Sure, you’ll have as much as you need for a while, but some products will start to spoil pretty quickly, like fruits and veggies.
- With no electricity to keep the fridges and freezers going, rice, beans, and canned foods are gonna be your best friends. After a while, you’ll probably need to learn how to grow food yourself.
- Medical supplies are also super important. You need to hit up as many pharmacies as you can for future supplies in case of an emergency. 
- Farming and DIY water-filtration aren’t the only things you need to learn. In a world where you’re the last human on earth, you’ll need to learn crucial survival skills, like hunting, first aid, cooking, and so on. 
- In a decade or so, all these buildings will become quite unsafe without regular maintenance to keep them up. 
- Perhaps you’ll move away from the city? The good news is you can go anywhere you want. There are no borders, migration laws, passports, or anything stopping you!
- Make sure you have garments for every season and plenty of warm clothes and blankets. 
- . You can learn to paint, make pottery, try your hand at sculpture, or even write your own story!

What Will Happen If You Start Eating Oats Every Day,"Doctors and nutritionists highly recommend making oatmeal a part of your diet and having it as your healthy morning meal. The secret is simple: good-quality environmentally-friendly oats help you feel and look better on the inside and out.
Oats have some unique properties thanks to the wide variety of vitamins and minerals they contain.  Zinc helps cleanse the skin and remove toxins and other harmful compounds. Iron is one of the most important elements for the nutrition and saturation of moisture in skin cells. Magnesium promotes blood circulation and noticeable skin cell renewal.
While protein is extremely important, your body also demands carbohydrates and fats, both of which you can find in oatmeal. Oats are also rich in antioxidants that help alleviate itching, inflammation, and high blood pressure.
The slow carbohydrates found in oatmeal help curb your appetite and maintain normal blood sugar levels. All those nutrients in oats not only boost your metabolism but also prevent the accumulation of fat and toxins in the body. Thanks to the antioxidants present in oatmeal, the probability of damage to the walls of blood vessels by free radicals is reduced significantly.
If you find it boring to just have oatmeal for breakfast every day, you’ll love the recipes we have put together to help you turn a boring oatmeal breakfast into something way more flavorful.

SUMMARY
-Oatmeal is ideal for treating inflammatory conditions, like eczema, dermatitis, and skin rashes. It also promotes healthy skin overall.
-One serving, or about half a cup, of oatmeal gives your body 15% of the recommended daily amount of protein. Don’t forget about vitamin E, antioxidants, and glutamine, which help muscle fibers regenerate faster.
-Oats are rich in antioxidants that help alleviate itching, inflammation, and high blood pressure.
-Oatmeal is full of carbohydrates that give your body the energy it needs.
-Beta-glucan in oats keeps you from overeating by helping you feel fuller for a longer amount of time and promoting the release of a satiety hormone.
-The linoleic acid and soluble fiber contained in oatmeal helps lower the level of bad cholesterol in the blood.
-Oats are rich in good healthy fats and support the cells in the heart and circulatory system.
-Experts recommend getting at least 25-38 grams of dietary fiber every day since it’s ideal for good digestion.
-Try apple pie oatmeal to boost your metabolism. You’ll need oatmeal, almond milk, cinnamon, maple syrup, a large apple and apple sauce to cook it. 
-The ingredients you’ll need for oatmeal raisin cookies are flour, sea salt, baking soda, butter, an egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, apple sauce and fast-cooking oats.  
-To cook almond butter-banana oatmeal, you’ll need oatmeal, milk, almond butter, honey and a banana.

"If Earth and Saturn Crossed Paths, Which Planet Would Win?","This planet's called ""The Jewel of the Solar System."" Made up mostly of gases, it could float on water - should you find a reservoir 75,000 miles across and just as deep. But what makes the planet so recognizable is its beautiful rings - gray, tan, and beige. They consist of dust, rocks, and ice. Some bits are as tiny as grains of sand, others - as large as skyscrapers. It's Saturn, and right now, Earth is hurtling toward it at breakneck speed. So what would happen if Saturn hit Earth? What happens when planets collide? 

Okay, let's imagine that all of a sudden, Earth changed the course it had been following for several billion years. But instead of rushing toward the Sun, it started to move away from the star. On second thoughts, it might be for the better - we've got more time to find a solution. Earth used to move around the Sun at a speed of 67,000 miles per hour. For some mysterious reason, when it left its orbit, the speed remained the same. It means we're going to cover 746 million miles separating our planet from Saturn within a year and three months... Here's another what-if video for space lovers!

"Gabzy, Odeal, JayO - Too Fine (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","Gabzy ft. Odeal & JayO - Too Fine (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Whether it be whisky, wine, or beer, musicians have a long history of booze-drenched lyrics. But can you recall one about Disaronno? Gabzy’s “Piano” might not be the first to tip the Italian amaretto, but his new track surely matches its taste. Every word from the Southeast Londoner goes down smooth, with just a hint of bite: “Girl, I see you/Don’t play games, I’ll read you/Follow me, I’ll lead you/Let me show you how we do.” One could be convinced that producer Lekaa Beats filtered the instruments through the amber-hued liquid. Raised by Nigerian parents, Gabzy reps a worldly vibe. For two years, he lived in the States and absorbed the country’s R&B on the radio. Mostly, the man who also goes by Mr. Malone - an “alter ego” - credits the “multicultural vibe” of Peckham, the London neighborhood where he resided the longest, with shaping his art. Music was always a first love; but his artistic career was sidetracked by his footballing talents. That was until some local rhymers caught wind of a freestyle and urged him back on course. The AyoJay fan often points to his 2019 EP, ‘Summers,’ as an artistic inflection point. It’s the project that solidified his creative partnership with American producer Melvitto. Recently Amaarae gave the duo a shoutout, joining Saweetie on the growing list of big names that have dapped up our man. In a surprise release, fellow UK heartthrobs Odeal, and JayO joined Gabzy for ""Too Fine."" All three artists have made a stamp on their own lanes within the UK RnB and Afroswing space, the collab captures the essence of their attraction.

Meet Disgust - Inside Out,"Streaming Now on Disney+ – Sign Up at https://disneyplus.com/

Meet Disgust. She is to thank when you see #TransformationTuesday photos of your trusty old bowl cut.

Inside Out comes to US theatres in 3D on June 19, 2015. 

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yKL4XdvoFs

#everydaylife #factsyouneverknew #brightside

SUMMARY:
- The toner melts and is finally fixed on paper, so you get a clear image and a warm sheet.
- When the AC cools the warm air, moisture forms, which accumulates and gradually flows out. 
- Many have heard that a fridge filled with food consumes less electricity. Sadly, this is a myth. The energy consumption is the same no matter if it’s stuffed or not.
- Microwaves only penetrate a couple of inches and do it unevenly around the dish. That's why your sandwich can be partly cold and partly scalding hot. 
- PWR (power) — everything is clear here. A light indicates whether your router is connected to the electrical outlet and receiving power.
- SYS (often indicated by a gear icon) is a system indicator. If it blinks, everything is in order; if it is constantly on, then it means an error in your system.
- WLAN is our favorite Wi-Fi icon. If it blinks, it means the wireless network is working fine and you can continue watching YouTube.
- LAN — these are 4 identical icons. Most likely, they will never bother you. They’re only on if several more computers are connected to your router via cable.
- WAN — the Internet icon. It shows that you are connected to the global network and must always be on.
- The QWERTY layout is said to have been invented specifically to slow down the typing speed. At the time of the first mechanical typewriters, metal keys were arranged alphabetically, and people sometimes typed so fast that the keys jammed with one another. 
- Black indicates a hot or live wire that’s carrying a current and brings power to all circuits.
- Red is the second hot wire for large appliances such as a stove, clothes dryer, or air conditioner. 
- Blue and yellow are hot wires too. They maintain common plug-in electrical devices, such as fans or lights. 
- White or gray indicate a neutral wire needed for safe work with electrical devices. Green, green with a yellow stripe, or bare copper work in a similar way. 
- Don't rush to put the dirty stuff in the dishwasher, though. The smell of detergent, warm water and the tactile sensation of plates — all this reduces stress levels by about 30 percent.

Ella Langley - Introducing Ella Langley | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Ella Langley - weren’t for the wind | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Excuse me, you look like you could use some Ella Langley in your life. With a voice like top-shelf whiskey splashed on an ex-lover’s shirt and set ablaze, the Alabama native has been hot on the country scene in 2024. The big spark came from her straight-out-the-saloon waltz “you look like you love me.” The flirty duet with Riley Green is country music at its best: sparkling piano and slide guitars, wry lyricism, and an imperfect romance. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 over the summer. The subsequent arrival of her ‘hungover’ album proved that where there’s smoke there’s fire. Tracks such as the simmering power ballad “nicotine” and rollicking “better be tough” recall the outlaw versatility of Miranda Lambert and pop capabilities of Kacey Musgraves. A couple years back, Ella moved from Hope Hull (pop. 4,000) to the Mecca of music, Nashville, where she paid dues at bars, honkytonks, and local festivals. Word spread about her ‘Excuse The Mess’ EP, and soon opening slot invites were rolling in from Jon Pardi, HARDY, Morgan Wallen and Luke Bryan. At the end of the day, however, Ella only needs Ella. “Hate to break your buckle, baby, you ain’t the only John Wayne here,” she warns on “cowboy friends.” “In the spur of the moment, some other boots could buy me a beer.” A little bit like the hair of the dog, Ella and her band cured all our nerves during her Artists To Watch shoot. “hungover” and “weren’t for the wind” came out sounding rich and fiery. Easy to knock back, with just the right amount of bite.

15 Chillingly Fun Facts About Ice Cream,"How long do you think ice cream has been saving humanity on hot summer days? No one knows for sure the story of how ice cream was discovered, but it likely dates back at least as far as the fourth century BCE. Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, would enjoy snow and ice covered in honey and nectar.  The Roman Emperor, Nero Caesar, was eating snow flavored with fruits and juices. Of course, it wasn't ice cream like we know it, but the story of real ice cream started outside of Europe.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

"39 COOLEST SUMMER IDEAS || Beach And Pool Life Hacks, Summer Clothing DIYs","TIPS FOR AN AWESOME SUMMER

Summer is the best time of the year and you can spend time at the beach, camping or having pool parties. We share a lot of tutorials and crafts that will make your holidays very comfortable. You will be surprised that pool noodles are very multifunctional and you can make a lot of useful crafts. Grab pool noodles and watch this video full of fun! Let’s make pool noodle candles that will help you to create a romantic atmosphere. Cut pool noodles to size and insert battery-powered tea lights. Besides, these candles could float. 
We know a trick for windy days: if the wind is blowing up your skirt on a windy day, we know a perfect decision. You will need band-aids and coins. Attach coins to the inner part of a skirt and the problem is solved. 
Sunburn is a real summer disaster. If you have forgotten to apply sunscreen, cure sunburn with tomato slices. Tomatoes have a healing effect that speeds up skin regeneration.
Mosquitos are very annoying and we share an all-natural repellent.  You will need paraffin or old candles and citronella oil. Melt paraffin and add a few drops of citronella oil, attach a wick and let you new candle cool. Citronella oil is one of the most effective repellents that is also natural.
Sunlight may hurt your eyes and you can make a simple and cheap sun visor from craft foam. This sun visor attaches to the earpieces of glasses. Take a craft foam and draw the visor shape, cut it out. Make holes for earpieces using a hole punch and attach to the glasses.

"Unbelievable Moroccan Food!! 🇲🇦 STUFFED PIGEONS + Medfouna! | Morocco, North Africa","🇲🇦 Best Moroccan Food in Rabat: https://youtu.be/Xcc6VMuROx0

RISSANI, MOROCCO - Welcome to the Sahara desert of Morocco, home to incredible people, culture, and unique food. Today we’re going on a Sahara Moroccan food tour to eat some of the most prized regional delicacies. 

A huge thank you to Moroccan Food Tour (https://moroccanfoodtour.com/) for arranging my trip to Morocco! 

Family home lunch - First we were invited to a local family home to prepare a delicacy of stuffed pigeons, filled with a mixture of scrambled eggs, kofta, and spices. The pigeons were roasted in the oven until golden crispy. I couldn’t believe how tasty they were - one of the best and most unique meals in Morocco! 

Rissani Bazaar - Rissani is a small but bustling town when it’s market day, and we arrived prime time to see all the action. We headed into the bazaar to buy meat and spices to make a food speciality called medfouna - which is a Moroccan stuffed flatbread filled with meat, spices, and nuts. We took the meat mixture to the baker where they prepared this incredible delicacy. 

After drinking some fresh camel milk, and taking an ATV ride we then headed to make another style, but more traditional medfouna baked in the sand. He added almost the same meat filling as the first, and then flattened it out and covered it in hot sand. A few minutes later, it came out - slightly burned - but after taking off the char, it was perfectly cooked, gooey on the inside and meaty on the inside. 

It was an incredible day of food and fun in the Sahara desert in Morocco! 

Thank you again to Mohamed and the entire team from Moroccan Food Tours (https://moroccanfoodtour.com/) for arranging this amazing experience!

7 Curious Facts Your Appearance Says About You,"Research continues to show that our appearance can say a lot about our personality and lifestyle. Let’s find out what exactly your facial features can say about you. 
Psychologist and neuroscientist Dr. Keith Welker studied the facial structure of around 1,000 World Cup soccer players and found that a player’s facial width-to-height ratio was closely connected to the number of goals he scored. The higher the number, the more competent a person is.
Your wrinkles tell the story of your life. There are certain muscles that work every time you smile, cry, frown, or raise your brows. After some time, they get used to particular emotions and “draw” them on your face, making them visible even when your face is resting.
There's a slight differentiation between genders when it comes to picking “the good side”. Women tend to turn to the camera with their left side. Researches believe that this is because the left part of our face is controlled by the right hemisphere of our brain, which is responsible for our emotions. That's why it seems way more attractive.
In 2015 a group of scientists analyzed 123 selfies taken from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site sort of like Twitter. The researchers found a fascinating connection between types of selfies and people's personalities. Selfie takers with the infamous duck face and high angle tend to be neurotic. People who are friendlier and more open to new experiences tend to use the bottom-up approach while taking selfies.
Have you ever noticed how identical twins start to look less and less alike as they get older? You can have the best genes ever, but the lifestyle you lead will still affect your appearance.

SUMMARY
-According to the research, the visually wider your face, the higher your chances of being successful are.
-British scientists have found that men with higher levels of testosterone have wider faces with broad cheekbones.
-Crow's feet and smile lines say that you're a true optimist who's pretty emotional but also just loves to laugh and have a good time. A crease on your forehead between your eyebrows suggests a completely different story.
-Engineers, mathematicians, and chemists usually pose with their right side to the camera, while art critics and psychologists prefer their left side.
-People who are friendlier and more open to new experiences tend to use the bottom-up approach while taking selfies.
-The bigger a person's nose, the more ambitious they are.
-Your bad habits are slowly being imprinted right on your face.
-Beautiful people might seem way friendlier than they really are. Those with a round face and big eyes are often seen as naive, genuine, and kind.

Lyrics:
Fear’s got me living with the lights out
Chained down like a prisoner in my own house
Shame cycles like a daily medication
I try but I can’t change my situation
 
‘Cause the liar comes to rob my joy
Yeah, I’m bruised, but I’m not destroyed
I’m rising like an army
And you’re gonna hear the sound
 
I’m calling the angels down
I’m storming the gates of hell
Tell the devil he don’t own my soul
I’m taking back what the enemy stole
 
I’m raising the battle cry
I’m holding the banner high
With the power of the Holy Ghost
I’m taking back what the enemy stole
 
Oh Oh Oh
 
Taking it all back
I'm taking back back what the enemy stole
Oh Oh Oh
 
I'm taking back back what the enemy stole
Nah you can’t have that, I’m taking back what the enemy stole
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh

Coronavirus: Trump extends US guidelines beyond Easter - BBC News,"President Donald Trump has said federal coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing will be extended across the US until at least 30 April.

He had previously suggested that they could be relaxed as early as Easter, which falls in mid-April.

""The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,"" Mr Trump said.

He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals.

White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci had earlier warned that the virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans.

Dr Fauci said that it was ""entirely conceivable"" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85z4N_sHXJw
Coronavirus: Beijing's back and forth lockdown - BBC News,"An increase in the number of cases of Covid-19 has led to fresh restrictions in some parts of the UK. But how do other countries cope?

Much of China has returned to a more normal pace of life after authorities began relaxing coronavirus lockdowns in late spring.

But as many cities have found out, loosened containment measures can be short-lived. In June, Beijing experienced a sudden surge of cases linked to a wholesale market, leading authorities to immediately quarantine close contacts, lockdown nearby areas, and mass test residents.

The upside is that with surprise outbreaks like this cropping up across the country, officials have fine-tuned their emergency response.

But the downside is that until there’s a vaccine widely administered, there will be a continued risk of repeat lockdowns.

The BBC’s China Correspondent Stephen McDonell explores the new ‘normal’ in Beijing, which has gone in and out of lockdown.

"Metal Balls Fell from Space in India, What Are They?","Do you like to listen to the sound of rain? And what if it rained money instead of water? That's what really happened in Germany once: a woman was driving, when she suddenly saw banknotes swirling down from the sky, so she hit the brakes. In several villages in India, in the middle of May 2022, huge black and silver metal balls started dropping from the sky, the first one weighing over 15 pounds. And this is still not the most unusual kind of rain!

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

LYRICS:
It’s a vicious cycle for a young boy coming from where I live
Your family strugglin so you got hustle to put food in the crib
Dem bills due fresh up out of school to see your mama tears
It's okay, mama. Imma get this bag and get us out of here
(You ain't think about no law when you seen roaches crawling in your crib)
Just a week ago the police shot your homie so you ain't got no fear
Had to take a chance to get them bands because it's that time of year
And he just got a handle, he might fan em if it's hot in here
 
Streets got guidelines, it's one code you don't break no matter what 
Baker Mayfield I'm living life like a scout I'm trying to grab a buck 
I put three zips up in a Peach Crush, look how stained the cup  
You had went to court and told I can't believe bruh used to hang with us 
Sold some bags, get your bread right 
Brabus truck, go check the headlights 
I grew up playing truth or dare, but I wouldn't dare stop at no red light  
Industry ain’t what it seem lil homie, though I got some millions from it 
Thought bruh survive a leg shot but he ain’t get to heal up from it 
Caught a distribution they came and took him off the street  
Incarcerated he cherish small things, he miss his bed 
We come from trenches, you never know what you gone see 
And I ain't never ever seen nobody beat the feds  
 
And I'm not one of them rappers who gone to try and diss the dead 
But I can't lie I smiled when I had heard he got buried 
Jojo sleeping with a knife, they don't turn the lights off when it's night  
He use a towel to hide the light and your girl don't answer the phone or write cha 
 
It’s a vicious cycle for a young boy coming from where I live (yeah, yeah)
Your family strugglin so you got hustle to put food in the crib (oh, oh)
Dem bills due fresh up out of school to see your mama tears (yeah, yeah)
It's okay, mama. I'm going to get this bag and get us out of here
You ain't think about no law when you seen roaches crawling in your crib (oh, yeah)
Just a week ago the police shot your homie so you ain't got no fear  (oh, oh)
Had to take a chance to get them bands because it's that time of year  (yeah, yeah)
And he just got a handle, he might fan em if it's hot in here (yeah, yeah)
Now he in a field just got a pack and his uncle traps, so he  taught him that 
And his daddy just came home from doing ten and they just sent them back (sent them back)
Like really, is this how you supposed to live when you come from the Jack? (This ain’t what we got to do)
That pressure on him, he heard it's time to win
He goes straight to the Mac (to the Mac)
All the ones that's supposed to be in your corner they just turned they back
The system dirty they’ll try to destroy you if you ain't in they pack
(Tell me what’s wrong)
Life is so crazy like a movie it's on Cinemax
He only 16 and he just had a baby that needs Similac (Whoo)
He just lost some friends (He just lost some friends)
(You look like my brother dawg)
He just lost some fam (He just lost some fam)
He just lost some bands (He just lost some bands)
Like when is it going to end (Trust me. Trust me)
He call on God he's trying to figure out why is life so hard (Life so hard)
And he trying to make it out but it looks so far (Looks so far)
Cause the streets and ripped it out now he ain't got no heart (he ain’t got no heart)
 
It’s a vicious cycle for a young boy coming from where I live (yeah, yeah)
Your family strugglin so you got hustle to put food in the crib (oh, oh)
Dem bills due fresh up out of school to see your mama tears (yeah, yeah)
It's okay, mama. I'm going to get this bag and get us out of here
You ain't think about no law when you seen roaches crawling in your crib

8th grade on Khan Academy: 8th grade is all about tackling the meat of algebra and getting exposure to some of the foundational concepts in geometry. If you get this stuff (and you should because you're incredibly persistent), the rest of your life will be easy. Okay, maybe not your whole life, but at least your mathematical life. Seriously, if you really get the equations and functions stuff we cover here, most of high school will feel intuitive, even relaxing.

"""God is a good lead to look into societies"" - BBC News","The career of the acclaimed Iranian photojournalist Abbas has spanned more than four decades and has taken him from the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City to perhaps the greatest boxing match of all time -- Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.  But it is his documentation of religion and its influence on culture, that's perhaps the most personally relevant to Abbas.  An avowed atheist, Abbas says it is his failure to comprehend religious fervour, that motivates him.  He spoke to the BBC 's Dan Damon about  a retrospective of his religious work, called 'Children of Abraham,' at the University of Pennsylvania's Arthur Ross Gallery

Mr Bean's January Sales Adventure... & More | Full Episode | Mr Bean,"Mr. Bean's misadventures take a turn for the wild during the January sales at the Arding & Hobbs department store. Not one to be outsmarted by a queue, Bean cleverly skips the line with a comedic ruse involving a dummy. His shopping spree, reflective of his unpredictable nature, ends with the purchase of a large armchair. But, as often is the case with Bean, transportation becomes a challenge. In a quintessential Bean move, he creatively drives his Mini from an armchair strapped to the roof, turning his journey into a comedy spectacle. The downhill diversion and failed brake attempt add suspense and hilarity, culminating in a genius save when Bean crashes his Mini into a mattress-laden lorry. It's Bean at his best: comically resourceful and entertainingly unpredictable.

Sneaking pets || 33 Weird hacks and tricks for pet owners,"Brilliant hacks for your pets and other DIYs every pet owner should know

Pet owners learn a bunch of tricks over the years. Some of those tricks are acquired by research; others by experience and a few of them by trial and error. Owning a dog, cat, rabbit – whatever animal you have, is one of the best things you can do in life as an adult. And with the tricks I show you in this video, I wanted to make your life a bit easier. 
Let’s start with a bed for your dogs. Sometimes, animals prefer the scent of their owners because it makes them feel more comfortable. So, you can take one of your old sweaters and turn it into a cute bed for your dog. Or, you can try something similar with an old pair of jeans. 
I also show you a trick on how to get your dog to play with his/her tennis balls. Watch the entire video to discover some smart tricks for your cats, and how to tackle all the hair shedding problem that comes with furry animals.

Tyla - Water (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Tyla - Water (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

There’s a new genre coming out of South Africa, and Tyla is one of its most promising young talents. “Amapiano, it’s the sound right now,” she explained to us after gliding through her DSCVR performances, where she put the emerging blend of house, R&B, and African dance genres such as Kwaito in the spotlight. In Zulu dialects, Amapiano means “the pianos,” a reference to the lounge keys usually weaved into its skipping four-to-the-floor rhythms. Tyla herself is a master of taking its glossiest elements and imbuing them with the sensuality of American R&B. “Getting Late,” her breakout debut, was all about making the most of a night’s final hours. Considering she designs her songs in the shower, it makes sense that a certain steaminess and nonchalance runs through recent bops “Been Thinking” and “Girl Next Door.” But like a rose garden, there’s thorns nestled between those Tyla’s delicate sonic petals and romantic aromas. “My first love was not my first heartbreak,” the Aaliyah and Rihanna disciple whispers in “To Last.” Ouch. Clearly, she’s learned how to pack punches from her pop-R&B heroes. “Water” is a particularly fetching track. “It’s kind of a naughty song,” she confessed, before adding, “It’s a summer song.” What else is there to say: dive in, but don’t expect to cool off.

"Ultimate Mexican Street Food Tour!! MEAT JUICE TACOS + Sonoran Hot Dogs in Tucson, Arizona!!","🌯 Eating the Original Chimichanga: https://youtu.be/sTzIkTh580o
👕 NEW T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

TUCSON, ARIZONA - Welcome to Tucson, Arizona, a small city, with huge heart and a lot of delicious Mexican food. Today we’re going on an ultimate Mexican street food tour of Tucson, and I can’t wait to share all the food with you today!

Friends in the video:
🔹 Adam Lehrman: https://tucsonfoodie.com/ (https://www.instagram.com/tucsonfoodie/)
🔹 Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!
🔹 Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures  (https://www.instagram.com/mexi_papa_adventures/)

Here are all the street food stalls, trucks, and restaurants we ate at:

Taqueria El Rapido: https://goo.gl/maps/y3f6GN9v2mrnZUhC8 - We started off with Taqueria El Rapido a laid back food truck selling a variety of different tacos. Mexi Papa ordered a combination taco for all of us, including asada, tripa, and cabeza, three wonderful different textures. It was a delicious taco and a great way to begin this food tour.

El Guero Canelo Restaurant: https://goo.gl/maps/83VH1GQEXy46YTvc8 - Sonoran hot dogs are one of the most popular foods in Tucson, and there are many to choose from. We decided on El Guero Canelo as it’s one of the most legendary, historical, and because this restaurant has even received a James Beard award - an award winning hot dog. It didn’t disappoint, a delicious creation.

Rollies Mexican Patio: https://goo.gl/maps/cBLJmU9auogWZ5yu6 - Next up for a modern twist to local Tucson Mexican food - Rollies. We had rolled tacos, flat enchiladas, carne asada fries, birria tacos, and birria ramen. You could taste the quality and amazing flavors. Great laid back spot with delicious Mexican Tucson style food.

Cocteleria La Palma Mariscos: https://goo.gl/maps/zqz6hc2Hcb9qah1T9 - When you have the meat sweats, head over to Cocteleria La Palma Mariscos for their ceviche and coctels. The mix of seafood was extremely refreshing and perfect for the hot afternoon in Arizona. I also thought their ceviche shrimp tostada was fantastic.
 
Tacos De Cabeza Estilo Cajeme: https://goo.gl/maps/jjoo3r9kv22S26h86 - Finally, probably one of my favorite places on this Mexican street food tour and favorite places in Tucson is Tacos De Cabeza Estilo Cajeme, where they specializes in head and tongue tacos. The owners are extremely friendly and their tacos will melt in your mouth.

And that completes this ultimate Mexican street food tour in Tucson, Arizona. We all really enjoyed it. Tucson has so much character, unique food, and friendly people.

What If It Rained in One Gigantic Drop,"If just 1 inch of rain fell over an area of 5,000 acres, the amount of water would be enough to fill almost 3-and-a-half million 40-gallon bathtubs! Imagine all the bubble baths! But what would happen if all this rainwater gathered in one gigantic raindrop and fell to the earth? 

So, it's a stifling day in the middle of July, and you're staying outside, trying to catch a breath of fresh air. Suddenly, you spot a dark cloud growing on the horizon. ""Finally,"" you think. ""I wouldn’t mind a cool shower!"" But then, as the cloud is coming closer, you notice that it doesn’t look like a regular cloud. For one, it's too big. And secondly, it's narrower at the bottom and spreads wider at the top...

What If The Sun Went Out for Just One Day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJNF1R4EDnw&

TIMESTAMPS:
The grass would catch fire?! 2:36
What if you stood right under the center of the drop? 3:14
What if you stood a bit to the side? 4:16
Real-time horror movie 5:31
What if it happened in the mountains 6:30
The largest raindrops ever 7:11
Phantom rain 7:25
Rain is snow 7:58
Speed of a falling raindrop 8:39

SUMMARY:
- This drop, which is almost a mile across, appears several miles above the ground where rain usually condenses. 
- The raindrop is rushing toward the ground at 200 miles per hour. Its outer layer gets whipped up into spray and turns into foam after mixing with the air. 
-  At the moment of impact, the water is already moving at 450 miles per hour. 
- Mere seconds before the monstrosity touches the ground, the grass right under the middle of the drop catches fire. 
- And what would happen to you if you stood right under the center of the falling drop? Well, assuming that the drop was symmetrical, the water would just fall around your body and wouldn't sweep you away. 
- Its pressure equals 155 atmospheres, and it's 155 times more than what you feel on land at sea level. 
- The soil simply explodes in the places where the water hits it. But the bedrock underneath is unyielding. It forces the water to rush sideways, destroying everything in its path.   
- In a matter of minutes, all that’s left for miles around is bedrock covered with pools of mud. 
- If the drop has fallen in a place surrounded by mountains, their ridges prevent the water from spreading further. Instead, massive streams surge to rivers and lakes and fill the valleys.
- The largest raindrops ever recorded fell from the sky in Brazil in 1995 and on the Marshall Islands in 1999. They measured roughly a third of an inch across! 
- There’s so-called ""phantom rain,"" when raindrops falling from a cloud evaporate when they're nearing the Earth's surface. 
- Usually, rain starts as snow. Clouds consist of teeny crystals of ice and freezing cold water. 
- Large drops of rain fall faster than their smaller mates.
- Large raindrops can accelerate up to 20 miles per hour. 
- That's why it usually takes such a drop around 2 minutes to reach the ground if it's falling from 2,500 ft, which is where most rainclouds hang out. 
- But if a raindrop is smaller, it may need up to 7 minutes to fall to the ground.

Extra content from Primates
Monkeys, lemurs, lorises, bush babies and, of course, the great apes. Countless faces, one remarkable animal family. Engrossing new stories combine family drama with the latest science. On Congo’s volcanic slopes, we meet an apparently fearsome silverback mountain gorilla, who turns out to be a gentle and attentive father to his young. Cutting-edge research indicates that caring fathers are the most successful silverbacks. In South Africa, we join an elusive and diminutive lesser bush baby from a newly discovered urban population, on a night-time raid of the city zoo. In Malaysia, we experience a Lar Gibbons’ canopy world from their perspective, in a filming first. From snow-capped mountains to the hottest deserts, and from the most remote, unexplored landscapes to the very heart of our modern world, Primates is the ultimate, definitive celebration of our very own animal family.

Tove Styrke - Mistakes - Vevo dscvr (Live),"Tove Styrke - Mistakes - Vevo dscvr (Live) - an exclusive live performance for Vevo dscvr, the channel for the best in new music. 

Tove Styrke got the performing bug from her parents – dad topped the Swedish pop chart in 1975 and mom taught ballet. Tove danced, learned piano and sang in a jazz band, did a stint as a model, and first entered the spotlight in 2009 when she appeared on the Swedish edition of Simon Cowell's 'Idol' (she finished third). Her self-titled electro-pop debut dropped in '10, featuring the single “Million Pieces,” which was co-written by Lykke Li. Tove has kept it rolling with a pair of EPs and her second album, 'Kiddo' (2015), and the April release of “Say My Name,” which was applauded by Elton John and Lorde, who placed the song on her Spotify playlist, “Homemade Dynamite.” Her new runaway-bride-themed video, “Mistakes” is a must-see, and the news that she'll be the opening act for the first 15 US dates of Lorde's Melodrama World Tour in 2018 is rocking her world. Her reaction: “Dreams are real...*pinching myself*.” Watch her tear it up the live version of “Mistakes” in our Vevo dscvr session.

Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol? - BBC News,"Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is facing disciplinary proceedings by the International Gymnastics Federation for displaying the letter ""Z"" on the podium next to a Ukrainian rival in Qatar. 

In Russia, the ""Z"" is fast becoming seen as a staunchly pro-war symbol of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 

It has been sported by politicians, seen on the sides of cars, vans and advertising hoardings - as well as daubed on bus shelters. 

It has even been used by Serbs at pro-Russian demonstration in Belgrade. Photographs have been widely shared on social media.

But what does the symbol mean?

TELEHEALTH: How New Technologies Are Transforming Health Care,"Telehealth combines telecommunications and health systems to deliver care and support across distances. However, this simple definition belies the complexity of this rapidly evolving field. A cadre of increasingly sophisticated technologies — matched with a need to reduce healthcare costs, serve more patients, and improve quality — drives the field in both high-income and low-income countries. Panelists in this Forum event examined aspects of telehealth in the U.S., including doctor and patient buy-in and the impact of the Affordable Care Act, and in other high-income countries. They also took a look at the role of telehealth in low-income countries, where technologies such as mobile phones can serve as vital tools for healthcare workers to ensure and evaluate standards of care in the diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses.

Part of The Dr. Lawrence H. and Roberta Cohn Forums, this webcast was presented May 15, 2015 in collaboration with The Huffington Post.

Wild West
This wild frontier has been forged by the elements and built by monumental forces. Over millennia America's most iconic landscapes have been carved out; wind sculpted deserts, like Death Valley and the Grand Canyon; giant redwood forests fed by precious waters; and extreme coastlines - from the wave sculpted shores of the pacific to the warm sheltered sea of cortex. Nowhere in America is more extreme, more varied and more spectacular than the Wild West.

Lyrics:
You think it's all about the swag
(over here)
You think it’s all about the bag
(over here)
Really we just spit the facts
(over here)
Really you just wouldn't last
(over here)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
New Kid
Yeah

New kid on the block a Smith & Wesson in my locks (locks)
Head is just a weapon and I look like static shock
One time for the threads I got the blessing from my pop (once)
Two times for the paper like a second Michael Scott
Serpent said the name was Lucy and she's recruiting
I’ma get the holy lose leaf and get to shooting
Say you know a better roster, please introduce me
Indie Tribe the biggest movement since freeing Boosie
I came from the clay just like I'm Cassius' son
I'ma be the greatest like I'm Ash Ketchum
Yeah, got some living water, I could pass you some
And the way that I be spraying gonna have you Harlem shaking like
Shake it, shake it, shake it, I'ma shake it off
Like Taylor
I'm a Saiyan, I'm a spirit bomb
I’m a slayer, I’m a slayer like I play guitar
Just a player with the head that's like a cinder block

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn me up, turn me up
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Let me cut them off

You think it’s all about the swag
(over here)
You think it's all about the bag
(over here)
Really we just spit the facts
(over here)
Really you just wouldn't last
(over here)

Yeah
Look
New kid on the block a Smith & Wesson in my locks
Head is just a weapon and I look like static shock
One time for the threads I got the blessing from my pop (once)
Two times for the paper like a second Michael Scott
Fresh off tour, I got the juice, (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bless my Lord, I got the loot
Kiss my boo then hit the booth, (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got the force like I was Luke
Not a fool, spit the truth, out my tooth, yeah
Take you to really new altitudes, yeah
And my crew got the cool interludes, yeah uh
Made it through out the tomb if I lose, yeah uh
I hit Marty on the celly, call me Padawan
Most you rappers don't believe what you got tatted on
You say the kids are all gimmicks and we don’t get it
But you just readin' the script and we really live it
Metaphysics – way I write it, they gon' quote it like the POTUS penned it
Keep my focus on my soul, not on your own opinion
Got the Tribe all on our skin and on my golden pendant
So you know the difference
Yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

You think it's all about the swag

You think it's all about the bag

President Xi warns China will not be bullied in Communist anniversary speech - BBC News,"China's President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will ""get their heads bashed"" if they attempt to bully or influence the country.

The 100th anniversary celebrations on Thursday morning saw military jet fly-pasts, cannon salutes and patriotic songs played.

Mr Xi delivered a defiant speech at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday.

He also said Beijing would not allow ""sanctimonious preaching"", in remarks widely seen as directed at the US.

It comes as China faces criticism over alleged human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong.

WORLD MENTAL HEALTH DAY 2017   Healing Minds,"Please  Subscribe: MSF International Channel  For Humanity   🆘
Your Comments  And Likes is Your  Feedback.
We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Rescuers rush to save beached pilot whales - BBC News,"Around 100 pilot whales have beached themselves near the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

Navy personnel and local volunteers have rushed to rescue them, but pushing the animals back into the ocean has been difficult as many get washed up again.

It's not clear why whales get stranded but it's not uncommon.

In September, hundreds of whales died on an Australian beach, in one of the largest strandings on record.

ADOPTED Three Legged Dog Rescued From Puerto Rico Plays With New Brother | The Dodo LIVE,"Great News - Lenny was JUST adopted by his foster family - which means that he'll be able to stay with his dog brother that he loves forever!! To support Lenny's upcoming surgeries visit: https://www.youcaring.com/lenny-936282

More on Lenny: Lenny was just another stray dog who tried to get by day after day, begging for scraps of food, running away from the danger. Only this time the danger caught up with him. Someone chopped off Lenny's paw and let him go free.  Unfortunately we probably never will find out what monster did that to Lenny, but what we could do was to save his life.

Aime Simone - Oh Yeah (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Aime Simone - Oh Yeah (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Aime Simone gave us an adorable answer when we asked him to list some of his inspirations. “My daughter"" said the French newcomer. Sometimes it’s easy to forget there’s a whole person behind an artist, especially one of Simone’s profile. His beats, typically employing riveting trap hi-hats and distorted 808s, hit hard; his personal style consists of flamboyant fabrics and a totally cutting-edge haircut. In a previous life, Simone was part of the LA fashion scene (hence his stellar English). That said, his self-labeled “post-pop” sound carries a tenderness reminiscent of Billie Eilish, another inspiration of his. So maybe the cute shoutout to his daughter shouldn’t be that surprising. Although Paris is Simone’s home city, Berlin was the place where his musical career took root. He recorded his debut album there. ‘Say Yes, Say No’ arrived in 2020 and quickly garnered buzz in the German club scene. You can hear his sonic breadth on the two album standouts. “In This Dark Time” is borderline emo rap, whereas “Shining Light” glides along with airiness and finger snaps. Both tracks have earned more than 10 million Spotify streams. The former track was embraced by pro-Ukraine activists. The new ‘Oh Glory’ album further embraces life’s more shadowy moments, but on “Give Me Love or Give Me Nothing” he finds the power to issue an ultimatum. You can really feel the catharsis when the final chorus hits in this DSCVR performance. Meanwhile, “Oh Yeah” has an alluring romantic slant, and some passionate dance moves, too. Guy has a lot of heart.

A-Eazy - Autopilot (Official Video),"It’s easy to lose your way after going through the motions of life for so long. Going through the motions is like being stuck on autopilot, mindlessly going through life day to day in a endless loop of hopelessness running from your pain. But there is a way to break this and that way is through the Lord. Jesus can steer you back onto the right path but you have to also want this for yourself. Break free of the autopilot today.

Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles at Xi'an Famous Foods & Flushing New York City Chinese Food Tour!,"Xi'an Famous Foods serves amazing food in Flushing, Queens, NYC!

On Day 31 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance we decided to take a New York City food tour to Flushing. The main thing I wanted to eat was at the famous Xi'an Famous Foods for their spicy cumin lamb noodles. But we also enjoyed some incredible dumplings and a rack of cumin coated lamb. It was incredible.

00:22 Journey to Flushing, Queens - The first part of the day was to take the train from Manhattan out to Queens, and more specifically to Flushing. It takes a while, but it’s pretty straightforward to get there by public transportation.

1:42 Xi'an Famous Foods - Located in the basement of the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens, Xi'an Famous Foods is a well known Chinese food restaurant with a number of branches throughout New York City. Xi'an Famous Foods was one of the top places I wanted to eat in NYC. At the bottom of the shopping center there’s a nice food court, and it really does feel like you transport yourself from NYC to China. I ordered the spicy cumin lamb noodles and an extra side of spicy cucumber salad. The spicy cumin lamb, with hand pulled noodles, was absolutely incredible - one of the best food dishes I ate in all of New York. And the spicy cucumber salad also went superbly with the noodles. The chili oil and the cumin was just absolutely superb. Total price - $15.51

6:56 Tianjin Dumpling House - Next up in the same Golden Shopping Mall, I walked over to Tianjin Dumpling House and I ordered their classic pork dumplings. Although you could choose from a range of many different types of dumplings. Overall, they were pretty good and I liked how they were cooked fresh so they were piping hot. Pork dumplings - $5

10:28 White Bear - For won ton lovers in New York City, taking a trip to White Bear in Flushing, Queens, is one of the food lovers pilgrimages. So after the spicy cumin lamb noodles we walked over to white bear. The won tons came with hot chili oil on top and an assortment of mostly pickled mustard greens. Although the chili wasn’t spicy, but was extremely fragrant and tasted amazing. It was another delicious places of dumplings in Flushing. Wonton with hot sauce - $5.50

13:35 Fu Run Restaurant - Finally, our last Chinese food meal in Flushing, we decided to sit down at a restaurant called Fu Run. Along with hot and sour soup and fries string beans, what I really wanted to try at Fu Run Restaurant were the Muslim lamb chops, fried and seasoned with an abundance of garlic and cumin. They were absolutely awesome, fall apart tender lamb, crispy on the edges and just coated in toasted crispy cumin seeds. Although some people say the quality of the Muslim Chinese lamb chops at Fu Run has gone down, I thought they were still absolutely superb. Though I’d like to try the same dish from other restaurants in Flushing, next time I’m in Queens. Total price - $49.50

19:14 Times Square station - Central Park - After coming back from our food trip to Flushing, Queens, we then took a walk around Central Park, just enjoying New York City.

21:03 Fresh&Co - For dinner, since I think I had eaten my share of meat for the day, I decided to go vegetarian and had a salad. Although it was too expensive, it was pretty good. Gaucho salad - $9.95

Nearly two years ago, we lost Bika the Roadkill dog and in June our buddy Big Joe the Shop Dog (aka BJTSD) was hit by a car. We knew it would eventually happen, as he just wouldn’t stop chasing vehicles, and he refused to live on a chain or behind a fence. He was really just a permanent stray, yet we’ll always remember him.

Raffaella - BLONDE (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Raffaella - BLONDE. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

“Hey someone famous/hit me with your car,” requests Raffaella in “On The Lookout.” That feature on the Neil Frances track was the singer's widest exposure in 2020, giving her lots of fresh ears on which to rain her acid wit. To OG fans, this was Raf being Raf - the indie pop owner of an acerbic POV who’s ready to call bullshit. 2017’s “Sororicide,” her debut single, was a delicate piano ballad with not-so-delicate lines about the pros and cons of Xanax and lip-filler that would make Regina Spektor blush. It entered the Spotify Viral Top 50 chart soon after release. Esteemed indie label Mom + Pop have backed the New York native from the start, and it’s been a good bet, as her pop craft takes better form with each release. This year’s “GROWN UP” sports an irresistible chorus over which the Billie Holiday fan tackles buying groceries, mani/pedis, trips to Kinkos, and pet ownership; previous single “BLONDE” ponders the particulars of 21st century hotness. They’re two of six tracks that make up her ‘LIVE, RAFF, LOVE (Act I)’ EP. There's nothing shy about this one - these unflinching DSCVR performances prove she’s happy to climb onstage and tell us how it is, exactly as she sees it.

17 Easiest Ways to Repurpose Your Old Laptop,"So you’ve bought yourself a new computer and suddenly there’s no place for your old one in your home. You can always sell it, of course, but there are much more interesting ways to use your old laptop or desktop PC. Turn it into a home server. Instead of keeping all your files on your new computer’s hard drive, you can set up a home group and connect all your devices in a single network.

Then, make your old computer’s drive shared with the whole network, and everyone in your house will be able to view and use files stored on it, as well as share their own. This comes in especially handy when someone in your family has a device with low space — this way, they can always keep new files in the shared storage. You also can make a surveillance camera out of it. It might look weird, though, if you just hang your laptop outside the door, so you may want to rewire it a little bit and extract the camera first. So, not sure what to do with your old laptop? Here are some cool ways to reuse it.

Breonna Taylor: Louisville to pay family $12m over police shooting - BBC News,"Officials in Louisville, Kentucky have agreed to pay $12m (£9.3m) to the family of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was killed in her home by police.

Taylor was 26 when she was shot at least five times and killed on 13 March during a mistaken drugs raid.

Her name has featured prominently in anti-racism protests in recent months.

Lonita Baker, a lawyer for Taylor's family, called the settlement just one ""layer"" in the effort to seek justice, and praised new police reforms.

""Justice for Breonna is multi-layered,"" said Ms Baker at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.

She called the agreement ""tremendous, but only a portion"" of what the family hopes for, including the arrest of the officers involved in her death.

Ooh
Bet i’d look good in some sheets
it’s been a long week
think i’m finna kick up my feet
I’m craving isolation
& a few tangerines
i crave a little me time
on my free time
But time be movin
Slow
But ain’t No stagger when I step
I’m a causal man
so I always watch before I tread
I ain’t mad
I’m just tryna get my ass up out this desk
it’s real hard to ease pressure off
With Ties around my neck

It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up
It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up

Cos
Its just better like that
Cos Its just better like that

It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up

It’s all good wait a minute
I got joy in my spirit
I got money in my pocket
And some seasoning for my chicken
Why am I stressing
won’t even address it
leave my problems
on my nightstand
Worries on my dresser
see now there’s a bigger picture
but I already know that
passing through the fire boy
I couldn’t take the blowback
& that right there’s the throwback
Ain’t really tryna go there again
it’s real hard when you’re in it
but i guess in the end

It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up
It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up

Cos Its just better like that
Cos Its just better like that

It’s all good baby
Just think I need to loosen up",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ih2_EKT0Xo
DNC 2024: Ex-Trump press secretary among Republicans back Harris | BBC News,"Former Trump spokesperson Stephanie Grisham has spoken at the DNC (Democratic National Convention) in Chicago, as well as those who have previously voted Republican, who now say they are backing Kamala Harris.
 
Speakers at the second night of the DNC include democratic luminaries as well as some very unexpected voices.
 
Grisham said Trump has ""no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth"" and that he mocks his supporters in private.
 
Meanwhile, the former US president has been holding his own speaking engagement in Michigan, where he issued a response to some of what was being said at this week's convention.

"Jordan Feliz - ""The King Is Alive (Official Music Video)""","Listen/Stream ""The King Is Alive"" at: https://fanlink.to/TKIA

Lyrics:
Come on now, getting loud with it
Sing it out, tell ‘em God did it
He Beat the grave and He’s still living
Risen to set the soul free

Why would I keep this song inside
I think it’s time to testify
Throwing my hands up to the sky
“Jesus is alive!”

The praises don’t stop, the devil’s been dropped
Got some good news coming straight from the top
He saved me from the fire, lifted me higher
Feeling so good, gotta sing it with the choir
‘Cause He’s alive, alive
The King is alive, alive

Crazy days got my head swimming BUT 
 we know the One who keeps the world spinning
We never lost, and we keep winning
‘Cause Jesus is still on the throne

Why would I keep this song inside
I think it’s time to testify
Throwing my hands up to the sky
“Jesus is alive!”

The praises don’t stop, the devil’s been dropped
Got some good news coming straight from the top
He saved me from the fire, lifted me higher
Feeling so good, gotta sing it with the choir
‘Cause He’s alive, alive
The King is alive, alive

Come on and praise the name
Somebody praise the name (Jesus)
Cause we’re forever saved
And death is in the grave (Oh Yeah)",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IlGhVA6KwM

What If You Were Born and Raised in Zero Gravity,"Imagine waking up every day in a world where up and down don't exist, where you float effortlessly through the air. Born and raised in zero gravity, your body adapts to this environment from the moment you enter the world. You'd learn to move with grace, mastering the art of propulsion without the constraints of gravity pulling you down. Everyday tasks like eating, sleeping, and even going to the bathroom would require unique adaptations and technologies to ensure your survival and comfort. But what if the opposite happened and gravity actually doubled? Let's see!

Russia's independent TV Rain channel back on air - BBC News,"Russia's last independent channel, TV Rain, is back on air more than four months after being forced to close over its coverage of the war in Ukraine.
 
Known as Dozhd in Russian, it resumed broadcasting from Latvia, streaming a news programme on its YouTube channel.
 
Dozhd was blocked by Russia's authorities in early March - just days after Moscow had invaded Ukraine.
 
Many employees then fled Russia, and later started work on rebuilding the channel abroad.

Coronavirus: Australian scientists first to recreate virus outside China - BBC News,"Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of China's coronavirus outbreak, as more deaths and cases were confirmed.

Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas island 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland.

Japan, the US and the EU are also repatriating their citizens.

British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, as the UK's Foreign Office warned against ""all but essential travel"" there.

Several other airlines have taken similar measures. United Airlines and Cathay Pacific are restricting flights, while Lion Air - one of the region's biggest airlines - is stopping flights to China from Saturday.

Cathay Pacific has also suspended inflight trolley services, changed some aspects of its meal offer, and stopped giving out hot towels, pillows, blankets and magazines in an effort to prevent the virus spreading.

LYRICS:

Verse 1:
I fill my vacancy with better times in hours with you
You give me freedom while I walk this oﬀ
But I care for you
And I feel the weight of your words
And they're pulling me out of dust
Cause I've been away with the world
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under
I feel a vacancy inside it's true
But I care for you

Chorus:
And I was wading in the water high
Crossing through the tide in the water, water
And I found reason in the deepest dive
With these hands of mine
In the water, water

Chorus:
And I feel the weight of your words
And they’re pulling me out of dust
Cause I’ve been away with the world
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under
In the water
In the water
In the water
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under

Verse 2:
Patiently moving you are on my side
While I’m falling through (falling, falling, falling)
Holding me higher champion my life
But you’re falling too
And I feel the weight of your words
And they’re pulling me out of dust
Cause I’ve been away with the world
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under
Holding me higher you are on my side
But you’re falling too

Chorus:
And I was wading in the water high
Crossing through the tide in the water, water
And I found reason in the deepest dive
With these hands of mine
In the water, water
And I feel the weight of your words
And they’re pulling me out of dust
Cause I’ve been away with the world
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under
In the water
In the water
In the water
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under

Middle 8:
In the water
In the water
In the water
(Tipping and tripping and taking, tipping and tripping and taking me under)

Chorus:
And I was wading in the water high
Crossing through the tide in the water, water
And I found reason in the deepest dive
With these hands of mine
In the water, water
And I feel the weight of your words
And they’re pulling me out of dust
Cause I’ve been away with the world
Tipping, and tripping and taking me under
In the water

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Bru-C - No Excuses (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Bru-C - No Excuses (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Thanks to Beyoncé and Drake releasing projects that heavily draw from dance music, the public’s consequent heightened interest in the genre can only be a good thing for Bru-C. With origins as a rave promoter, the Nottingham MC lives and breaths the UK club scene - considered by many as the Garden of Eden of dance music. For many these sweaty dance floors are escape routes from the hardships of real life; Josh Bruce was no exception. “It’s important for me as a young, mixed-race lad from the Midlands to just be transparent,” he says about the “thoughtful edge” to his party tracks like “Paradise” and “No Excuses.” Specifically, Bruce/Bru-C (he says he can’t separate himself from his artist moniker) has been celebrated for leading the resurgence in bassline - a cultural subgenre of UK garage. His biggest streaming hit post-COVID “Streetside” led crowds back to the dance floors following lockdown. Latest track “Playground” kicks off with hyper drum ‘n’ bass percussion. In it Bru-C’s vocals act as a gravitational force, dictating ebbs and flows of energy. “This is England, the kingdom/The world is ours,” he smoothly declares. Confidence on Drake and Beyoncé levels, with beats to match.

"half·alive - ""RUNAWAY"" (Live) | Vevo DSCVR","half•alive – “RUNAWAY” (Live Performance - DSCVR)

Long Beach, CA trio half•alive has a knack for supple grooves, lots of hooks, throwing down some crazed choreography. All three elements were in their bag of tricks when the band recently hit the Vevo studios. Singer Josh Taylor, drummer Brett Kramer, and bassist J Tyler Johnson have a puckish sense of humor as well as skills at building unique pop tunes, and with nod to their forebears OK Go, they always have a trick up their sleeves regarding a cool, coordinated presentation. They rolled through the terrific ""RUNAWAY"" with sharp rhythmic attack, but their ""arrow"" performance couldn't concludes without some cool synchronized steps that you need to see.

Measles outbreak could have deadly consequences in Nigeria,"Measles-related admissions have reached record levels at Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) facilities in Borno State, northeast Nigeria. Measles can be deadly on its own or as a precursor to malnutrition. 

Vaccination coverage is low in this region, and recent vaccination campaigns urgently need to be reinforced. However, the security situation, significant funding cuts by international donors for Nigeria, and the continuous neglect of public health infrastructure could create the conditions for a range of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.

MSF is warning international and national stakeholders not to ignore what could worsen the humanitarian crisis in northeast Nigeria in 2024.

29 SCHOOL HACKS YOU WISH YOU KNEW BEFORE,"Brilliant school tricks you'll love trying in school

In this video, I show you some cool hacks and ideas that will change your life in class. 
If you got bad grades in a lesson, you can change it using the marker tricks I show you. You can turn all the minuses to plus signs and your letters to As. 
If you want to remember an equation for math class but you can't, you may simply write the equation on a Coca-Cola bottle and flip it upside down. Then, you can bring the half-filled bottle with you in class, and every time you need to check your notes flip it upside down. 
You can also write those cheating little note in between two identical rulers or at the back of a ruller. 
If your rolling ball pen is no longer working, simply warm up the tip. It will let the ink flow and you can use it again.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mn9EKDopQU
Tamera - Poison (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Tamera - Poison (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Like many artists of her generation, Tamera studied at the University of Beyoncé. When listening to her Afrobeats-tinted R&B and scrolling through her well-manicured Insta page, it’s not hard to imagine that the rising Brit singer actually took classes in The Art of Sasha Fierce. Each move has been a wise one. Raised just outside of London in Kent, young Tamera was molded into a confident vocalist by her church minister grandma. “She would push me to sing in front of other people,” the appreciative granddaughter recalls. After navigating the wild world of competitive singing TV shows and an early label deal, the then-teenager emerged with an eye on the indie route. R&B is the “main thread” of her sound, she says, but early singles such as “Wickedest” revealed an inclination to mix son clave riddims and the various guitar sounds of West African pop into her intoxicating sonic potions. With only one EP to her name - 2021’s ‘Aphrodite’ - Tamera has cultivated a community of like-sounding UK artists such as Tay Iwar (“Good Love,” “Honest”) and DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023 alum Nonso Amadi (“Shivers”). Not to mention, her 100k+ followers love the way she mixes positive vibes with lavish aesthetics on her socials; it’s all about manifesting success after all. To that point, “Poison” might be Tamera’s strongest release to date, a zephyr of soft keys, undulating percussion, and romantic tension. Now she’s the one doing the teaching.

Lennon Stella - Fortress (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Lennon Stella - Fortress (Official Performance) 

After wowing viewers of 'Nashville' as Maddie Conrad for the last few years, the multi-talented Lennon Stella didn't waste time strolling into a music career to parallel her acting endeavors. And it has moved forward quickly. The Ontario native, who comes from a musical family, has earned herself lots of a fans in a short time. She made a nice entrance with ""Like Everybody Else"" and grabbed a big splash of visibility working with Jonas Blue and Liam Payne on ""Polaroid."" Last year's 'Love, me' EP, featuring ""Bad,"" ""Breakaway,"" ""La Di Da"" and ""Fortress"" solidified the fact that she's an instant charmer. We had her in for an exclusive stripped-down spin on the latter tracks, and the came out great. Don't miss our latest DSCVR session.

I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

François Chollet is the creator of Keras, which is an open source deep learning library that is designed to enable fast, user-friendly experimentation with deep neural networks. It serves as an interface to several deep learning libraries, most popular of which is TensorFlow, and it was integrated into TensorFlow main codebase a while back. Aside from creating an exceptionally useful and popular library, François is also a world-class AI researcher and software engineer at Google, and is definitely an outspoken, if not controversial, personality in the AI world, especially in the realm of ideas around the future of artificial intelligence.

A Balloon Trip to the Highest Point on Earth,"Hey there! Ever wanted to have a ride in a hot air balloon? Well, look no further: today I’ll take you into the skies… and even a little beyond! My balloon here is made of a special material, so we’ll fly as close to outer space as possible.

By the way, our trip's gonna be really fascinating! You'll find out what the tallest things on Earth are. And you'll see them, course! One of them just drives me crazy. It's the Millau Viaduct in France. Yes, it’s a bridge, and it’s three times as tall as the tallest tree on Earth! Can you imagine that? Oh, I've waited so long to see it! So, ready to ride? Hop in, then!

#tallestthings #FactsYouNeverKnew #brightside

SUMMARY:
- We’re going further upwards, and we’re finally at the height of the tallest tree on Earth: Hyperion. Located in California, this redwood stands at 380 ft  tall. 
- Now, going juuust a little bit up, and we’re looking at the top of the tallest rollercoaster in the world, Kingda Ka in New Jersey, standing at 418 ft.
- At the height of 1,125 ft, we’re flying over the Millau Viaduct in France. Yes, it’s a bridge, and it’s three times as tall as the tallest tree on Earth. 
- At 2,080 ft, we’ve reached the top of the Tokyo Skytree — the tallest observation tower in the world. 
- Now we’re finally reaching the height of the tallest building ever made: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It’s 2,722 ft tall, and the sky seems to be closer here than the ground.
- Did you see that lightning? We’ve just passed through a real storm cloud. They’re the lowest hanging clouds of all because they’re the heaviest.
- A little bit of respite, and here we are, approaching one of the highest elevations in the world: Mauna Kea, the tallest volcano on Earth, located on the big island of Hawaii.
- The higher we climb, the more difficult it is to breathe. At this height, though, there’s still enough air for us, it’s just a bit too fresh for my liking.
- And at the moment, I present you the tall, mighty, and unbeatable Everest — the tallest peak in the entire world, located in the Himalayas. 
- As we’re rising higher and higher, we’ll soon be saying hello to… yes, here they come: cranes! Yep, these birds are crazy when it comes to flying, and climbing up to 33,000 ft is a piece of cake for them.
- 36,000 ft is the altitude that’s often called a sweet spot for airplanes. In fact, it’s anywhere from 35,000 ft to 42,000 ft.
- Tropopause is a layer that separates the troposphere from the stratosphere, and the air here doesn’t become colder with increasing altitude.
- And finally, we’re out of the tropopause and into the stratosphere. The sky here is deep blue, and it’s the highest we can get on our balloon. 
- In 2005, a man from India rose to 69,850 ft, setting a world altitude record, and safely returned to the ground after that.

MINIATURE CRAFTS || 20 Cute And Useful DIYs And Decor Ideas,"An adorable miniature craft and other projects you should try at least once

In previous videos, we showed you how to make a miniature house from tiny bricks. We also showed you how to make small knives, little scissors from paper clips, and even realistic foods using polymer clay. Well, today, we’ve got a brand new project. We show you how to make a tiny stove using tiny bricks. The best part? It’s a fully functioning stove. You can use it to cook anything you like (but it’ll be a really small meal). 
It’s also essential to eliminate the amount of trash we produce, and one way to do that is through recycling projects. So, I give you some ideas on repurposing multiple plastic bottles into an outdoor sweeping broom.  
Now for the engineering enthusiasts, I’ve got a fun project to try when you’re bored. I show you how to make a robotic arm using cardboard. You won’t need batteries or electricity to make it work either, just a few syringes, tubes, and colored fluid to make it hydraulic.

MSF Responds to Cholera Outbreak in Lebanon,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working with Lebanon’s Ministry of Health and other humanitarian groups to respond to the country’s first outbreak in 30 years. People living in refugee camps and host communities have been impacted by the highly contagious waterborne disease, which causes profuse diarrhea and vomiting and can quickly lead to death left untreated. Lebanon’s current economic crisis has led to the breakdown of water and sanitation systems, creating the perfect conditions for a cholera outbreak, which can rapidly spread through contaminated water supplies. MSF outreach teams are raising awareness of the symptoms, treatment, and prevention of the disease in several parts of Lebanon, and our medical teams are preparing to open cholera treatment centers, training local medical staff, and adapting our hospital in the Bekaa region to treat cholera patients.

Fake News & Post Truth: How world changed in 2016 - BBC News,"Last Christmas David Cameron was 7 months into a 5-year term as prime minister of a Conservative government. Donald Trump was 6 months into his campaign for the US presidency and still seen as a maverick candidate with no chance of success. Syria was in turmoil. And then 2016 happened. Syria still in turmoil but the other political realities turned upside down amid much talk of fake news -- and post-truth politics. In first of a series looking at how the world changed in 2016 here's our special correspondent Allan Little.

Iran Crisis: Tehran launches missile attack and President Trump responds - BBC News,"President Trump says Iran appears to be standing down after it launched more than 20 missiles at Iraqi bases where US troops are stationed. He urged countries - including the UK - to send a ""clear and united message"" to Iran that its ""campaign of terror"" will no longer be tolerated.  
 
The ballistic missiles were launched from the western Kermanshah Province in response to the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani by the US.
  
Al-Asad airbase in Iraq’s Anbar province was hit 17 times, including two missiles that failed to detonate.  According to the Iraqi government, a further five missiles were targeted at a base in Irbil. Both the UK and American governments have said none of their citizens were killed or injured. 

In his address this afternoon Donald Trump said the US would impose additional sanctions on Iran.

Meanwhile, just hours after the Iranian missile attacks a Ukrainian passenger plane, carrying 176 people - including 3 Britons, crashed shortly after take-off in Iran. There were no survivors. 

The majority of passengers on the Boeing airliner were from Iran and Canada.  Several airlines have now said they will avoid Iranian airspace.

Coverage presented by Sophie Raworth with reports by Jeremy Bowen, Nick Bryant, Laura Kuenssberg and Tom Burridge.

7 Tricks That Can Make Your Car Last Longer,"If you want your car to serve you longer and save money on expensive service and maintenance, pay attention to these simple yet really important rules. Experts recommend a few things to keep in mind and a few common mistakes to avoid to make your car last longer. If you stick around till the end of the video, we’ll tell you how you can fix a cracked windshield with garlic.
Having the correct tire pressure is a sort of “Goldilocks” situation. If it gets too low OR too high, you can have serious problems. Don't forget about seasonal tire changes and remember to swap your front and rear tires at least once a year.
Sharp acceleration and abrupt braking might feel like fun, but they’re actually extremely harmful to vehicles. If you decide to park on an incline and put your car in Park, it puts too much pressure on the transmission. In rare cases, it can even become dislodged or break down. So the best option is to use the emergency brake.
With the help of the symbols on the car's dashboard, your car can tell you when something's wrong, like when the engine's overheated, something's wrong with the electrical system, or the brake fluid level is too low. Go to an auto repair shop as soon as possible to save yourself from expensive repairs or even an accident. Weighing your vehicle down excessively does nothing good for the car's suspension, steering, transmission, tires, and engine. Plus, overloading increases fuel consumption and makes the car more difficult to handle.
Remember that cars, just like people, need regular check-ups and “health” tests.

Music: Retro - Wayne Jones

TIMESTAMPS
Keep your tire pressure in-check. 0:40
Take it easy on the gas and brake pedals. 2:03
Park correctly. 2:42
Don't ignore the dashboard. 3:54
Don't forget about vehicle inspections and repairs. 5:13
Avoid overloading. 6:03
Don't overload the clutch. 6:50
Bonus: fix a cracked windshield with garlic! 7:18

SUMMARY
-Check your tire pressure at least twice a month (but once a week is even better). While adding air to your tires, make sure they aren't warm to the touch and don't overfill them.
-If you’re a fan of sharp acceleration and abrupt braking, remember both of them are actually extremely harmful to vehicles. Plus, you’re just burning more gas than you need to.
-Avoid throwing the car into Park before coming to a full and complete stop. The same goes for putting the car into Drive or Reverse before stopping fully: don’t do it.
-If you notice the engine light flashing while you're driving, slow down right away because this might be a sign of a serious problem. The brake light lets you know that somewhere in the braking system something has gone wrong.
-Check your car’s manual to find out how often you should change your oil or air filter and remember that a lot of it depends on your driving habits. Get yearly inspections and keep in mind that routine maintenance will depend on the season and the mileage.
-Get acquainted with the maximum load capacity for your car and stick to it. Try to get rid of all of the useless stuff in your car.
-Don't hold the clutch in at long traffic lights. During short stops, shift to Neutral and press the clutch right before you start moving.
-Take a clove of garlic, cut it lengthwise down the middle, rub the cut side over the crack, and wipe away the excess juice with a paper towel or napkin to keep the crack from getting worse until you can get it repaired.

Towa Bird - Sorry Sorry (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2025,"Towa Bird - Sorry Sorry | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Towa Bird knows that angst manifests in many forms. From the romantic, to the economic, to the existential, the rising indie rocker with Filipino and English roots speaks to all forms of anxieties with a precision that only comes with personal experience and a sharp pen. It’s all there on her debut album, the cheekily titled ‘American Hero,’ which Rolling Stone recently named one of the 100 best from 2024. Its tracks range in areas of concern. “Sorry Sorry” sticks out the stiff arm to an unfortunate friend who wants to be more than that; the jangly “B.I.L.L.S.” rails at paying rent and wider pitfalls of capitalism. Fan-fave “Drain Me!,” meanwhile, lets the endorphins flow a bit. Longtime Towa fans know that the guitar is her first musical ally, having been inspired by the Kinks and Jimi Hendrix as a kid. Raised in Hong Kong, Towa would cut her teeth playing street festivals and dive bars around the massive city. Eventually she started posting covers to YouTube, which further extended her reach. “Having guitar-centered music… it’s always been my focus,” she explained to us. Tyler, The Creator and Willow Smith have given Towa daps for her celebration of queer experiences and reimagination of what energetic rock music can look like in the LGBTQ+ space. No surprise, more like-minded artists have joined the fan club. This fall, Towa joined Billie Eilish on tour for a handful of dates. “Hehe im nerv,” she wrote on Insta - vulnerable in her worry yet ready for the challenge as always. The Towa mindset is one we can all take to heart.

Donald Trump sues US justice department over Mar-a-Lago search – BBC News,"Former US President Donald Trump has asked a judge to freeze the justice department's investigation of files seized from his Mar-a-Lago home.

Eleven sets of classified files were taken from Mr Trump's Florida estate on 8 August, according to the FBI.

US presidents must transfer all of their documents and emails to a government agency called the National Archive.

The FBI is investigating whether Mr Trump improperly handled records by taking them from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after he left office in January 2021.

He has denied any wrongdoing and said the items were declassified.

Rise Up (Lazarus)
Come Forth 
Dead man open your eyes 
The Lord ain’t finished with you 
Wake up You sleeper
Watch what he can do
Dead man open your eyes 
Jesus is calling for you 

In the dark and all alone 
Growin comfortable
Are you too
Scared to move
And walk out of this tomb

Buried underneath 
The lies that you believed 
Safe and sound 
Stuck in the ground
 Too lost to be found 

You're just asleep 
And it’s time to leave 

Come on and rise up
Take a breath, you’re alive now
Can’t you hear the voice of Jesus calling us
Out from the grave like Lazarus 
You’re brand new
The power of death couldn’t hold you
Can’t you hear the voice of Jesus calling us
Out from the grave like Lazarus 

When He said your name 
The thing that filled your veins 
Was more than blood
It’s the kind of love
That washes sin away

Now the door is open wide 
The stones been rolled aside 
The old is gone 
The Light has come 
So… 

He’s calling us to walk out of the dark
He’s giving us new resurrected hearts

Armani White - BILLIE EILISH. (Live) | Vevo DSCVR Artists to Watch 2023,"Armani White - BILLIE EILISH. - Live Performance | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2023

The “it factor.” The “whole package.” Call it what you want, but when we had Armani White come through our Ctrl studio earlier this year, we were pretty blown away by his skills. So much so that we insisted he return, this time to our Artists To Watch 2023 stage. Even if you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve still probably felt the Philly rapper’s “BILLIE EILISH” rattling your coop. Crafted by July Da Producer and riding a sly rework of N.O.R.E.’s “Jewel,” it emphasizes the hop half of hip-hop - it’s impossible to stay seated while it bumps. White says Billie is a big inspiration; dude’s been a fan since the “my boy” days, and an even bigger fan of the superstar’s fashion choices. “I wanted to make something that pays homage to her creativity and playfulness while also displaying my very similar character,” he told us. Mission accomplished. Those plugged into the Philly rap scene likely know White’s 2019 project ‘Keep In Touch.’ His charismatic delivery and penchant for ambitious beat selections really came through on standout tracks “Onederful” and “Public School.” Think a little Brockhampton here, a smattering of Aminé there. Even though this was his second time performing his breakout hit for us, this new spin feels super fresh. A live drummer and more room to bounce around helps with that. Watch out, whirlwind coming through.

Levent Geiger - 2 Dumb Kids Remix (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Sometimes music is just part of your DNA. “There are old video recordings of me where I was singing and dancing in a diaper as a one-year-old,” says Levent Geiger, our latest DSCVR artist. The German-born, world-traveling polyglot spent his childhood leveling up at various instruments and skills. Piano. Sax. Guitar. By the time he was a teen, this voracious musician had won singing competitions and toured as part of a classical piano duo. Now in his late teens, it’s pretty clear young Mr. Geiger is the full pop package. Last year’s “Bad Days” showed the charming songwriter-producer has a sharp ear for those glimmering beats that masses love to eat up. More recent track “2 Dumb Kids” bottles up the infinite feelings of being a carefree teen. And check his TikTok. Dude has a funny side, not to mention a natural self-promoter. “When I started, Charlie Puth was a huge inspiration,” he told us. The similarities are easily apparent. He definitely charmed us in our studio when we captured “2 Dumb Kids” and latest track “Lost.” Likability on 1000%.

6 Little-Known Ways to Buy the Cheapest Airplane Ticket,"An airplane ticket for $5 seems to be nonsense but not when you know how to search! Have you ever heard, for example, about the 24-hour rule? Check the same flight the next morning after you’ve booked it because search engines often set filters to default and may suggest cheaper options. If the price is lower, you can cancel your booking and re-purchase your ticket! 

One more cool thing is well known to experienced travelers: they hide their destination in the middle of the route. If you need to get to Istanbul, don’t rush to book a direct flight. Sometimes, a flight to Rome with a transfer at Istanbul may be much cheaper. Interested? Here're some unusual ways to find the cheapest option!

SUMMARY:
- The 60-day rule works perfectly. Look for your flight not later than 1.5 to 2 months before the trip. Buy tickets on dates from mid-January until early March. Try to purchase your tickets on Tuesdays between 2 and 4 pm. Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons are when the ticket prices are the lowest.
- The website airfarewatchdog.com has a ""Top 50 Fares"" section that is updated daily. Another site, secretflying.com, posts a selection of system errors daily. Better follow it on Facebook and Twitter to stay updated.
- They are otherwise called budget airlines, and their policy is the best price you can get. Ryanair, one of the most popular budget airlines in Europe, is well known for its crazy discounts.
- Use other search engines too, rather than only the low-cost airlines as they track budget airlines and system errors. However, don’t forget to check the airline companies’ websites — on rare occasions their fares might be lower.
- Cheap ticket search engines analyze the prices among hundreds of airlines for the route you need and sort them by price, date, time of flight, number of stops, and other factors.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W6rntBADUQ

Alaina Castillo - just a boy (Live Session) | Vevo DSCVR,"Alaina Castillo  - just a boy. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

“Since I can’t say stuff to people’s faces, might as well sing it.” So says the somewhat introverted Alaina Castillo. A self-professed shy girl, the Houston-raised, LA-based singer-songwriter is one of those performers who’s much more comfortable entertaining people in front of a camera than she is making small talk face to face. Vlogging and singing covers in ASMR on YouTube was the longtime Elvis fan’s original outlet. A few of those covers, like her spin on Billie Eilish’s “lovely"" say,  now boast millions of views. Singing comes naturally to Castillo, who’s been sharpening her skills since youth church choir days back in Texas. While in college, she began writing songs from her own perspective, penning lyrics in both Spanish and English. 2019’s ‘antisocial butterfly’ was her proper debut EP, a collection of bilingual bops that quickly garnered some buzz. “Just A Boy” dropped a year later and immediately took off, positioning the girl with the dyed locks as an artist with a future. In May, her debut album arrived - well, the first half it, at least. Like a diary, ‘parallel universe pt 1’ contains intimate odes to weed, romance, and personal wellbeing. Spacey and sensual, ‘pocket locket’ is one of ’em, and it sounded great in our DSCVR studio. “just a boy” did too. Prepare to be captivated.

15 Ways to Recognize And Avoid Low Quality Clothing,"15 tips that will help you detect a poor-quality item right on the spot. When we buy a piece of clothing, we want to get a quality item. Unfortunately, it often happens that new clothes shrink or get torn after the first wash. 

TIMESTAMPS
Check the quality of cotton by squeezing it 0:40
Hold the fabric up to a bright light 1:09
Pull the seams to see the gaps 1:33
Avoid open zippers 2:02
Check the hem 2:24
Give fabric a tug 2:53
Make sure the zipper matches in length 3:13
Well-cut 3:26
Pay attention to the label 4:09
Make sure the seams and threads match 
Check buttons and buttonholes 5:07
Check if it has a yoke 6:17
Look at the coloring of the folds 6:42
 A center back seam 7:08
Patterns matchup 7:33
How to Select the Perfect Clothes for Your Body Shape 8:26

SUMMARY
- When buying clothes made of cotton, do this simple but very illustrative test: grab some fabric and squeeze it as tightly as you can in your fist for a few seconds. Then check if the fabric looks like a crumpled piece of paper. 
- To check the thickness, hold the fabric up to a bright light. If you don’t see much through it, you are safe to buy it. 
- A pull test can help you understand if you are holding a piece of junk in your hands, or if you have to pay for it right now feeling happy that you found it. So, try pulling stitched pieces apart. 
- Make sure you buy clothes and accessories with metal zippers covered with a strap: they are the most reliable and long-lasting. 
- Pants and skirts should have a hem of up to 2 inches. Blouses and shirts can do with a smaller one of about 1 inch. If there is no hem at all or it’s simply stitched, we do recommend buying this item. 
- A quality item will always keep its shape. Take a stretchy part of a dress or a skirt, tug on it and then let it go. 
- Zippers on dresses, skirts, or any other kinds of clothing should be equal in length, even and math in color. 
- If you notice symptoms like this, don’t jump to the conclusion that you shouldn’t have skipped your gym. It’s possible that the manufacturer just saved money and didn’t use enough fabric. 
- Natural fabrics, such as cotton, silk, and wool are strong and more durable than synthetics. However, 100% cotton can quickly shrink after washing. 
- Examine fabric pattern and thread colors. If patterns don’t match and stitches are made with threads of different colors, it is a clear sign that this item was made in a hurry. 
- When manufacturers make a fake or a low-quality item, they often don’t pay attention to little details. This is why you should always carefully examine buttons and buttonholes before buying an item. 
- Good shirt and blouses must have a shoulder yoke. It makes the top look neat on you. Cheap items of clothes don’t have a yoke, so they don’t just look bad, but also uncomfortable to wear. 
- If the coloring on the handles, straps, or fastenings looks faded or leaves marks on the folds, this is a clear sign of a low-quality item. 
- When you buy a jacket or a coat, pay extra attention to the center back seam. The thing is your back probably doesn’t look completely flat, so if you want it to look beautiful, there must be a quality back seam. 
- Even a very quick look at them can tell you a lot about how much effort has been put into producing the item. For example, if the pattern on the pocket doesn’t match the pattern on the rest of the item, it means that the production was sloppy, and they tried to save money on the materials.

"Jon Batiste - Born to Play (From ""Soul"")","Everybody has a soul. Joe Gardner is about to find his. Watch Disney and Pixar’s Soul in theaters now.

What is it that makes you...YOU? In theaters and on Disney+, Pixar Animation Studios’ feature film “Soul” introduces Joe Gardner (voice of Jamie Foxx) – a middle-school band teacher who gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22 (voice of Tina Fey), who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions. Directed by Academy Award® winner Pete Docter (“Inside Out,” “Up”), co-directed by Kemp Powers (“One Night in Miami”) and produced by Academy Award nominee Dana Murray, p.g.a. (Pixar short “Lou”), Disney and Pixar’s “Soul” is streaming on Disney+ and in theaters for the first time ever.

Disney+ is the only place to stream your favorites from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic and more.

Abba on new album Voyage: 'We don't need to prove anything' - BBC News,"Forty years after their last studio album, Abba have made one of the most anticipated comebacks in music with the release of their new record, Voyage.

But the 10-track album has divided opinion among critics.

Benny Andersson isn't worried. ""I don't think we're taking a risk because if people think that we were better 40 years ago, fine.""

He said he thinks Voyage will be the quartet's swansong and told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson: ""I don't want to do another Abba album.""

7 Natural Disasters That Might Happen in the Next Years,"It happened 74,000 years ago, and it was one of the Earth’s largest explosive eruptions. It caused a global winter that lasted for years. Volcanic gases were ejected into both hemispheres and moved all around the planet. The eruption created the famous Lake Toba, which covers an area of 436 square miles. The Toba volcano is still active, and if a similar eruption happens again, it will directly affect both Indonesia and Malaysia. But Toba could also pump out enough gas to affect the whole world’s climate. 

There is no bigger force than nature. Every year natural disasters occur all over our planet. Despite the fact that we can fly into space, we still can't withstand the forces of nature. Let's find out which natural disasters are possible in the future. From bad solar storms to global earthquakes and meteor strikes, these catastrophic events might threaten the world in the near future and affect millions of people.

US Supreme Court backs protection for LGBT workers - BBC News,"America's top court has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country's civil rights laws.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said federal law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, should be understood to include sexual orientation and gender identity.

The ruling is a major win for LGBT workers and their allies.

And it comes even though the court has grown more conservative.

Lawyers for the employers had argued that the authors of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had not intended it to apply to cases involving sexual orientation or transgender. The Trump administration sided with that argument.

LYRICS:
I’ve been looking for a clean fix
No more games or cheap tricks
I feel like a crooked line
I’m done saying I’m alright
 
I’m learning to let things go
I’m trying to live on hope
And even when I let myself down
Let myself down
 
I’ll still be here tomorrow
God’s still holding me up
There’s gonna be
Trials troubles and sorrow
But God’s still holding me up
Holding me up
Holding me up
Holding me up
 
I’m sick and tired of comparison
And all those wasted moments
I was looking guiding light
What I found was a jaded mind
 
When I’m running out of patience
When I’m running out of truth
You call me to the table
And say the Fathers proud of you

Praise Him all you creatures great and small

Hollowing wind, rushing streams
Rolling hills and crashing seas
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Praise Him gleaming moon and burning sun
Praise Him all you spinning spheres above
Shining stars, golden beams
Choir made of galaxies 
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Holy 
You are holy
Earth and heaven
Sing forever
Holy 
You are holy
All creation
Praise Creator

Praise Him who stepped into what He made
Paid our debt and pulled us from the grave
Every heart He set free
Every soul that’s been redeemed
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Holy 
You are holy
Earth and heaven
Sing forever
Holy 
You are holy
All creation
Praise Creator
This my great and everlasting hope
I’ve been saved and heaven is my home
I can’t wait for that day
When I see You face to face
For I was made to magnify my Maker
Yes I was saved to walk beside my Savior
I’m created to worship my Creator
Holy 
You are holy
Earth and heaven
Sing forever
Holy 
You are holy
All creation
Praise Creator
Holy 
You are holy
Earth and heaven
Sing forever
Holy 
You are holy
All creation
Praise Creator
Yes all creation

Lyrics:

I’ve seen it on the internet 
I’ve seen it in my DMs 
I’ve seen it in a late text 
That’s a fucking body 
 
I’ve spied it with my little eye 
Something that could change me 
Better than a day dream 
That’s a fucking body 
 
Ooooo experience it for myself 
Doooo you think that we could work this out
Ooooo experience it for myself 
Oooo are you up whatcha doing right now cus 
 
That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body  
And I really wanna get to know it 
 
That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
Do you got somebody 
Cus I really wanna get to know it 
 
The way the lines make a V 
Mark the spot for the thing I need 
Baby I just want the keys 
That’s a fucking body 

I hope that this behavior is admissible 
Cus I know you know that this is all consensual 
Ooooo experience it for myself 
Do you think that we could work this out

That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body  
And I really wanna get to know it 

That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
Do you got somebody 
Cus I really wanna get to know it 

I can’t seem to focus on anything else 
The only thing I notice is the way you carry yourself 
I can’t seem to focus on anything else 
Are you up, whatcha doing right now cus

That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body  
And I really wanna get to know it 

That’s a fucking body 
That’s a fucking body 
Do you got somebody 
Cus I really wanna get to know it 

I can’t seem to focus
That’s a fucking body
That’s a fucking body
And I really wanna get to know it

I can’t seem to focus
That’s a fucking body
Do you got somebody
Cus I really wanna get to know it",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a2bVCMZPms

Chile protests: Clashes in Santiago as unrest continues - BBC News,"Five people died after looters torched a garment factory near Chile's capital Santiago, bringing the death toll in violent protests to at least eight.

The military and police used tear gas and water cannon against protesters and a curfew was imposed in major cities.

A state of emergency already in place in Santiago is to be extended to cities in the country's north and south.

The unrest, sparked by a now suspended metro fare hike, has widened to reflect anger over living costs and inequality.

There is set to be major disruption on Monday with many banks, schools and shops expected to remain closed.

Grade 7th on Khan Academy: 7th grade takes much of what you learned in 6th grade to an entirely new level. In particular, you'll now learn to do everything with negative numbers (we're talking everything--adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, decimals... everything!). You'll also take your algebraic skills to new heights by tackling two-step equations. 7th grade is also when you start thinking about probability (which is super important for realizing that casinos and lotteries are really just ways of taking money away from people who don't know probability) and dig deeper into the world of data and statistics. Onward! (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Lyrics
It looks like heaven, it feels like hell
This picture perfect paradise this pretty lie I show and tell
And if I'm honest, I'm someone else
And every story testifies I'm terrified to be myself
 
So, here’s another sunrise, here’s another good time
And here’s my outfit of the week
Here’s a great throwback, here’s the lunch I had
It seems like I'm living the dream
 
I want you to lie like me, I want you to lie like me
God forbid you see the things I don't want you see
I want you lie like me
 
This broken mirror, this painted screen 
It started as a way to feel better 
But it just never works for me
 
So, here’s another sunset from the day that he left
I guess I’ll go on with the show
Does the golden sky make you think my life is fine 
Well, even if you don’t
 
I want you to lie like me, I want you to lie like me
God forbid you see the things I don't want you see
I want you lie like me
 
I don’t even wanna buy what I'm selling 
I don’t even wanna buy what I'm selling
What I am selling? What am I, what am I…
 
I want you to lie like me, I want you to lie like me
God forbid you see the things I don't want you see
I want you to lie like me
I want you to lie like me
I want you to lie like me

John Hopfield is professor at Princeton, whose life's work weaved beautifully through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology through the piercing eyes of a physicist. He is perhaps best known for his work on associate neural networks, now known as Hopfield networks that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed the development of the modern field of deep learning.

Donald Knuth is one of the greatest and most impactful computer scientists and mathematicians ever. He is the recipient in 1974 of the Turing Award, considered the Nobel Prize of computing. He is the author of the multi-volume work, the magnum opus, The Art of Computer Programming. He made several key contributions to the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms. He popularized asymptotic notation, that we all affectionately know as the big-O notation. He also created the TeX typesetting which most computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and scientists and engineers use to write technical papers and make them look beautiful.

The planet, called HD 219134b, is a bit larger than Earth and located a mere 21 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation, near the North Star. While HD 219134b orbits too close to its star to sustain life, it is the closest exoplanet to Earth to be detected transiting, or crossing in front of, its star – which makes it perfect for extensive scientific research. The results of this discovery are the subject of a study accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Resale tickets price to be capped in UK | BBC News,"The UK government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.
 
They are also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing after Oasis fans were charged £200 more than advertised for tickets to their reunion tour.
 
The cap would also apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.
 
They will launch a consultation to seek views on capping resale prices on a range, from the original price to up to a 30% uplift, and limiting the number of tickets resellers can sell.

"Mumbai Street Food Day - Paneer Tikka Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Bhel Puri, and Sev Puri","SUBSCRIBE NOW► http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe 
T-shirts: http://bit.ly/2bCOj2c

Day 5: Mumbai, India - We started off the day by first dropping our bags off at the airport. Then we had an amazing street food dosa from Anand Stall. Then we headed to Juhu Beach, which is a favorite beach to hang out and eat Mumbai street food. I tried pav bhaji and bhel puri, then we headed to have some marvelous sev puri, and finally went to the airport to catch our Air India flight from Mumbai to Muscat.

1:49 Anand Stall for Dosa - Located not far from Juhu Beach in Mumbai is Anand Stall that serves one of the best street food dosas in Mumbai. They have a list of creative types of dosas you can order, and when I saw the paneer tikka dosa on the menu, I knew that’s what I needed to order. They cooked it up in front of me, with the batter and then adding in all the toppings. The paneer tikka was scooped onto a plate with the rolled up dosa. It was incredibly delicious, one of the best street foods I ate in Mumbai.

6:04 Juhu Beach and Street Food - From the amazing Anand Dosa, we took an auto rickshaw over to Juhu Beach. Juhu Beach was a bit stormy on the day we visited, and it was incredibly windy. So I decided to just have a quick coconut refreshment while standing on the beach before heading into the food area.

8:00 Pav Bhaji - One of the most popular Mumbai street foods is pav bhaji, which includes bread and bhaji, which is a combination of potatoes, tomatoes and spices mashed up into an almost gravy like consistency. The bhaji is eaten with the buttered bread and it’s a favorite Mumbai food.

11:12 Bhel Puri - Another common Mumbai street food is bhel puri, and it’s especially known for being served on the beaches of Mumbai. The recipe for bhel puri includes puffed rice and sev, which is stirred up with a variety of chutney and some spices, and onions and tomatoes and potatoes. It was awesome, and made a fantastic beach snack.

14:07 Sev Puri (6th Road Sev Puri) - When it comes to Mumbai street food chaats, sev puri is one of my all time favorites, and I was happy to have the opportunity to eat it one more time before leaving Mumbai. Not far from Juhu Beach is a street food stall called 6th Road Sev Puri, that serve a variety of chaat, but sev puri is what they are known for. It’s the best sev puri I’ve ever had. The combination of chutneys and the toppings were sensational.

16:51 Rickshaw to airport - After our final Mumbai street food snack, we jumped into an auto rickshaw and drove to the Mumbai airport to catch our flight.

18:53 Air India lounge - Waiting for our flight, we hung out at the Air India lounge, and they actually had some very good food at the lounge, including some more paneer tikka.

22:02 Arriving to Muscat, Oman - We flew from Mumbai to Muscat on Air India.

Does America Make a Better Barra?! Vortec 4200 Turbo Engine Builds!—Hot Rod Garage Preview Ep. 85,"Watch the full episode on MotorTrend: https://bit.ly/2OmYS8Z
On this episode of HOT ROD Garage, hosts Tony Angelo and Lucky Costa are going to take on the legendary Aussie engine, the Ford Barra. It’s a beastly 4.0L six-cylinder turbocharged unit that churns out enough combined tire smoke yearly to blot out the sun! These engines are the best that Australia has to offer, and they reign supreme in the land down under. The boys think that Chevrolet might have just built something in the Vortec 4200 that could be a better Barra! Both engines are around four liters, both are inline-six cylinders, both have 24 valves, so there’s only one thing to do, and that’s build a couple of these Vortec engines up, bolt turbochargers to them, and see what they can do!",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ekE1ibCFvo

39 BRILLIANT IDEAS TO REUSE ANY PLASTIC ITEMS,"SIMPLY GENIUS WAYS TO REUSE PLASTIC BOTTLES

Check out a new collection of ideas on how to reuse plastic and turn it into something really helpful. People throw away millions of plastic bottles every day and 80% of them simply becoming non-biodegradable litter. It is convenient to consume drinks straight out of plastic bottles, but the waste that is accumulated in the process takes huge damage to the health and the environment. 
 You will find how to make jewelry from plastic cups, how to remove light using a plastic bottle, how to hide money during the travel and a lot more. You can even make an aquarium from plastic bottles. It’s a cool choice for beginners. You can easily inflate a balloon at home using soda. Yes, it sounds crazy but you can take a cola bottle, add soda and vinegar. Place a balloon in the top of the bottle to inflate. We share an easy way to fix clogged showerhead. Take a plastic bag, mix baking soda, liquid soap, and vinegar in it. Place a showerhead inside and wait for 20 minutes. The result is incredible!
One more cool idea is to make a kebab machine by your hands! This project is inexpensive and won’t take much effort. But the result is great to share with your friends! You will need a coke bottle, a can, and an elbow-shaped piece of PVC pipe and skewers to make perfect kebabs. Cut off the top of the plastic bottle. Make a hole in the center of the pipe and connect the pipe to the bottle. Kebab machine is ready! Now try your incredible kebab machine!

"Heat Comparison: Places, Objects And Stars","Have you ever heard of Burkina Faso? It's a Colorado-sized African country near the Sahara Desert. Its name means “Land of Honest People.” And the temperature here averages 28°C (82°F). It's the warmest country in the world. But the hottest place on Earth is  Iran’s Lut Desert. It holds the record for having the Earth’s hottest surface temperature, which can climb as high as 71°C (159°F). By the way, sand dunes in this desert can be over 1,500 ft in height – taller than Empire State Building!

As for the hottest inhabited place on Earth, it's Dallol, Ethiopia – a cauldron of burning salt, volcanic rock, and sulfuric acid. It has the world's highest average temperature for an inhabited place, calculated at 35°C. However, the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth is 57°C (134°F). It happened on July 10, 1913 in Furnace Creek, California. Okay, yes, maybe it's a bit confusing. But there's nothing that you need to remember! This is just a new compilation of cool facts about our planet. Ever thought how hot (or not) different objects are? Watch this video to find out.

#RomeoSantos #OfficialVideo #EresMía

Lyrics:
Ya me han informado que tu novio es un insípido aburrido
Tú que eres fogata y él tan frío
Dice tu amiguita que es celoso, no quiere que sea tu amigo
Sospecha que soy un pirata y robaré su flor

No te asombres si una noche
Entro a tu cuarto y nuevamente te hago mía
Bien conoces mis errores
El egoísmo ha de ser dueño de tu vida
Eres mía, mía, mía
No te hagas la loca, eso muy bien ya lo sabías

Si tú te casas
El día de tu boda, le digo a tu esposo con risas
Que solo es prestada la mujer que ama
Porque sigues siendo mía (Mía, mía, mía)

You won't forget Romeo
Ah-ah
Gostoso

Dicen que un clavo saca un clavo pero eso es solo rima
No existe una herramienta que saque mi amor

No te asombres si una noche
Entro a tu cuarto y nuevamente te hago mía
Bien conoces mis errores
El egoísmo ha de ser dueño de tu vida
Eres mía, mía, mía
No te hagas la loca, eso muy bien ya lo sabías

Si tú te casas
El día de tu boda, le digo a tu esposo con risas
Que solo es prestada la mujer que ama
Porque sigues siendo mía (Mía, mía, mía)

Te deseo lo mejor
Y el mejor soy yo
The King

You know your heart is mine
And you'll love me forever
You know your heart is mine
And you'll love me forever
Baby, your heart is mine
And you'll love me forever
Baby, your heart is mine
And you'll love me forever

No te asombres si una noche
Entro a tu cuarto y nuevamente te hago mía
Bien conoces mis errores
El egoísmo ha de ser dueño de tu vida
Eres mía, mía, mía, mía
No te hagas la loca, eso muy bien ya lo sabías

Si tú te casas
El día de tu boda, le digo a tu esposo con risas (Jajajaja)
Que solo es prestada la mujer que ama
Porque sigues siendo mía",Music,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iPcqtHoR3U

General Election 2019: Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim - BBC News,"A row has broken out after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed his party had obtained documents that show the NHS has formed part of talks with the United States about a trade agreement after Brexit. Mr Corbyn says the papers are 'proof' that the Conservatives would put the NHS at risk. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claims were 'nonsense' -- and the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. 

Meanwhile in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the Scottish National Party's manifesto. The SNP leader said the party promises to 'escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands'.

BBC News at Ten coverage with Huw Edwards in the studio, Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg in Westminster, Scotland Editor Sarah Smith in Glasgow and Lorna Gordon in south-west Scotland.

Lyrics 

My momma called me crying 
Why you broke and and up to no good?
mom you know I've really been trying 
To do everything I could

So I hanged up and went back to bed
Cause I Got pictures inside of my head 
Yes I know, I know, I know
That some day, one day, Monday I will be

High with somebody 
I wanna reach and touch the sky 
with somebody 
I wanna feel so freaking fly with somebody 
and If I had to pull a heist with somebody 
then it would have been somebody like you

Somebody like you 
Somebody like you

Forgive me if I am whinin' 
But she may have been the one 
She was diggin' for money 
and we know that I've got none
Let me be 

High with somebody 
I wanna reach and touch the sky 
with somebody 
I wanna feel so freaking fly with somebody 
and If I had to pull a heist with somebody 
then it would have been somebody like you

Somebody like you 
Somebody like you 

It's a good thing I've been hurt before 
and that I love staring at the wall 
I'll be waiting 'til tomorrow comes
the sun will shine, I'll be fine and Friday I will be 

High with somebody 
I wanna reach and touch the sky 
with somebody 
I wanna feel So freaking fly with somebody 
and If I had to pull a heist with somebody 
then it would have been somebody like you

Somebody like you

Sam Smith - Writing's On The Wall (from Spectre) (Official Music Video),"Writing's On The Wall (from Spectre) (Official Music Video)

The official 'Writing's On The Wall' music video.

Lyrics:
I’ve been here before
But always hit the floor
I’ve spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I’m feeling something
That makes me want to stay

Unprepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I’m going to make it through the day
Then there’s no more use in running
This is something I’ve got to face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won’t be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

The writing’s on the wall

How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

Steven Pressfield is a historian and author of War of Art, a book that had a big impact on my life and the life of millions of whose passion is to create in art, science, business, sport, and everywhere else. I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic, including Turning Pro, Do the Work, Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and the Warrior Ethos. Also his books Gates of Fire about the Spartans and the battle at Thermopylae, The Lion's Gate, Tides of War, and others are some of the best historical fiction novels ever written.

LYRICS: 
Dylan on that speaker warnin’
He not busy being born is dying

God I wanna be reborn
I swear my failure’s ain’t for lack of trying 

My broken history 
decomposes
But it’s the part in me that’s
Pushing up roses 

I’m a desert in bloom
I’m a desert in bloom

The wind is torn 
the worlds at war
But the butterflies and me keep death defying

The dandelion seeds are born 
And all my favorite dreams are 
when I’m flying

I see the chrysalis going through changes
But every transformation comes in phases 

I’m a desert in bloom
I’m a desert in bloom

Let the pain be for a reason
There’s a time and there’s a season
And I want to see this through
I’m a desert in bloom

Yesterday’s tomb, tomorrow’s womb
The dark is long but the dawn is soon
The light that you seek is seeking you
Let the dead seed go and watch it grow brand new

I’m a desert in bloom
I’m a desert in bloom
Let the hard times make me wiser
With failure’s fertilizer 
For the flowers on my tomb
I’m a desert in bloom

What If We Dig a Hole That Swallows All Earth's Air,"The great day is finally upon us — the record-breaking hole-boring team is finishing their job today! Spectators have gathered from all parts of the continent just to look at the greatest borehole in the world, and even the Guinness World Records commission is officially dumbfounded. The hole is more than 1,000 miles in diameter and goes almost as deep as the Earth’s core — no one achieved this depth before! 

But wait, what’s going on? People all around suddenly begin fainting. More and more of the spectators fall unconscious on the ground, their faces white. Did the diggers hit some dangerous gas pocket? Oh no, we’re getting messages from all over the world that people start falling just where they stood! So this is the scenario you get if you dig a hole in the ground deep and wide enough to fit the whole atmosphere inside it. So how deep can you dig a hole? And what's the deepest human-made hole in the world?

Google chief denies political bias claims - BBC News,"Google chief Sundar Pichai has faced accusations of political bias from US politicians.

Mr Pichai was being quizzed by members of the House Judiciary Committee about the way his tech firm runs it business.

Google was accused of having ""programmed"" bias against conservative views into its algorithms.

Mr Pichai denied the accusation saying he had ""issues"" with studies that claimed to show the firm's search results excluded right-wing views.

He was asked by Republican committee member Zoe Lofgren why, when she googled the word ""idiot"" under images, a picture of President Donald Trump came up.

In response, Mr Pichai explained that keywords were matched against billions of page results and ranked for relevance, popularity and how other people are using the word.

Judeline - Introducing Judeline | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2024,"Introducing Judeline: Watch her DSCVR Artists to Watch 2024 performances here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPhdUsYPZU&list=PLf8adv46DGyvgPmTB3wMg7IlL9tUBS4-4&index=1

Staying true to your origins while embracing all sorts of new possibilities is an ongoing artist conundrum. That’s why we were so tickled to find a Judeline quote about sustaining  “Andelusian weight” to her recent cover of Shakira’s “La Tortura.” The Spanish singer boasts a sense of pride regarding her roots. As recent triumphs such as “2+1” and “CANIJO” stack up, the 20-year-old Cadiz native shows the competition how to incorporate a healthy respect for tradition while keeping things quite pop, quite catchy, quite modern. Just ask Rosalía. The superstar shared one of Judeline’s tracks early on, a co-sign that deeply enhanced the young singer’s profile. But Judeline is rightly wary of too much spotlight, and too much guidance as well. Moving from the town of Los Caños de Meca to Madrid when she was 17, the former Lara Fernández Castrelo has always had a self-trust guiding her vision. When she began making music on a professional scale, the opinions of industry mentors started flying. “It’s easy to be influenced (by others),” she has said, “but you have to be careful. Little by little I’m defining myself.” She often cites her respect for Spanish singers Laylow, Feid, and Kali Uchis, but doesn’t want to work in the shadow of any one artist. Increased cred has helped with this goal. Last year she was invited to work with Alizzz and his Disqualified project; this past September she had everyone at the Caja Mijas buzzing about her performance. She can sound fragile, like when she’s cooing through “TANGER.” But that signature whisper also has an inquisitive vigor; it feels like she’s taking chances in the bouncy pop of “ZAHARA.” All her strengths were put forward when she hit our studio for the ATW performance of “2+1” and “CANIJO.” She’s truly a force.

——————————————————————————————————

Ser fiel a los orígenes pero a la vez abrirse a todo tipo de posibilidades, es el eterno dilema de los artistas. Por eso nos fascina haber encontrado una cita de la misma Judeline hablando de no dejar de lado “el peso Andaluz” en su reciente cover de “La Tortura” de Shakira. La cantante española se jacta de orgullo alabando sus raíces. Mientras sus éxitos “2+1” y “CANIJO” amontonan views, la veinteañera gaditana da una lección de cómo conservar el respeto por las tradiciones mientras añade pinceladas pop, ritmos pegadizas y un sonido moderno. Pregúntenle a Rosalía. La superestrella ya compartió uno de los temas de Judeline, un sello de calidad al porvenir de la joven artista. Pero Judeline es acertadamente cautelosa en no ser demasiado viral, ni tampoco demasiado influenciable. Mudándose de su natal Los Caños de Meca a Madrid con tan solo 17 años, Lara Fernández Castrelo (este es su nombre original) siempre ha confiado en su visión y su instinto. Cuando empezó a hacer música profesionalmente, las opiniones entre los mentores de la industria fueron brillantes. “Es muy fácil dejarse influenciar (por otros)”, había dicho, “pero hay que estar pendiente de escucharse a uno mismo. Poco a poco me estoy definiendo”. Frecuentemente muestra su admiración por otros artistas como Laylow, Feid o Kali Uchis, pero sin querer trabajar a la sombra de ninguno. Su credibilidad sólo crece, conseguiendo este objetivo. El año pasado fue invitada a trabajar con Alizzz y su Disqualified project; el pasado septiembre exaltó la multitud en Cala Mijas. Puede sonar frágil, como en el susurro de “TANGER”. Pero ese bisbiseo tan propio tiene una energía cautivadora; que también se siente en su tema más popero “ZAHARA”. Todas sus cualidades salieron a relucir cuando pisó nuestro estudio para sus actuaciones ATW de “2+1” y “CANIJO”. Verdadero poderío.

Lyrics:
I’ve had a dollar to my name
I’ve had friends that walked away
And I’ve even lost myself a time or two
There were bridges crossed and burned
But through all the wreckage I have learned
There is one thing that I can never lose

If I got Jesus
I’ve got all that I could ever need
Take the world away from me
And I’ll be okay 
If I got Jesus
There’s a hope that’s living deep inside 
A joy that I could never hide
And a safe place to fall
If I got Jesus
I got it all

I’ve seen weakness turn to strength
I’ve seen failures met with grace
And it’s not from what I’ve done
It’s Christ in me
A miracle I can’t explain 
Oh He’s given me His name
I’m the richest man that I could ever be

If I got Jesus
I’ve got all that I could ever need
Take the world away from me
And I’ll be okay 
If I got Jesus
There’s a hope that’s living deep inside 
A joy that I could never hide
And a safe place to fall
If I got Jesus
I’ve got it all

Oh oh 
Someday that trumpet’s gonna sound
And the King of heaven will ride upon the clouds coming down
I’ll hit my knees, oh Lord then sings my soul
I’m going home

If I got Jesus
I’ve got all that I could ever need
Take the world away from me
And I’ll be okay 
If I got Jesus
There’s a hope that’s living deep inside 
A joy that I could never hide
And a safe place to fall
If I got Jesus
I got it all
If I got Jesus
I got it all

Lyrics
We’re dressed to the nines, we stress that we’re fine
Go out every night
We’re lost in the dark, we’re barely a spark
We’re both just pretending we’re something we’re not
 
I reposition my hands, my hair, my cheek so you might listen to me
I’ve been conditioned to win a piece of the war you started
 
What if we turned the light on and we just got honest
What if everybody said what they really wanted to say
Stop trying to hide the way I did before
I’ve got no filter anymore
I’ve got no filter anymore
 
So quick to critique, you’re painting a screen
Of how I should look, how to feel, what to think
But never really see me
 
I reposition my hands, my hair, my cheek so you might listen to me
I’ve been conditioned to win a piece of the war you started
 
What if we turned the light on and we just got honest
What if everybody said what they really wanted to say
Stop trying to hide the way I did before
I’ve got no filter anymore
I’ve got no filter anymore
 
I reposition my hands, my hair, my cheek so you might listen to me
I’m done competing with who I am and who you want me to be
 
What if we turned the light on and we just got honest
What if everybody said what they really wanted to say
Stop trying to hide the way I did before
I’ve got no filter anymore
I’ve got no filter anymore

6 Strange Einstein's Habits That Could Have Contribute To His Genius,"Some say that great minds think alike, and that’s up for debate, but they do seem to have one thing in common – they have some strange habits. Albert Einstein, one of the smartest people ever, had a lot of quirks! Did you know, for example, that he despised socks for some reason? He never wore them at all. He wrote once in a letter to his wife, Elsa, that he had to wear high boots all the time just to hide his bare feet. 

Also, Einstein had a strange routine linked to his daily naps. While he drifted into dreamland, he held a metal spoon in his hand and had a metal plate lying on the floor right underneath the spoon. When he fell asleep he would drop the spoon on the plate. But why would he do that? Let’s find out!

#Einstein #success #inspiration

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- The only reason Albert Einstein didn’t wear socks was that in his childhood, it took him just a day or two to wear out a hole in a new sock. His thoughts were so important for him that any issue – even annoying socks – wasn’t worth the distraction. 
- Another habit that Albert Einstein adopted in his childhood was building houses of cards. When our brain is busy with something mechanical, it sets free our ability of abstract thinking. The more concentration needed, the greater the possible effect will be!
- Despite his first reaction, Einstein was curious enough to change his mind about violin playing. Also, there’s no better rest for your brain than a change of activity. Tired of doing math? Play guitar! Tired of playing the guitar? Go for a walk, try out some photography. 
-  It’s not that Einstein was lazy or a sleepyhead – that’s for sure. But he was a passionate sleeper. We all know that a healthy night of sleep is good for your brain. But generally, 7 to 9 hours is enough. Still, it’s important to remember that we’re all different. For some of us, 6 hours are alright and others need all 10, like Einstein.
- His walks had nothing to do with benefiting his health. The thing is, while we walk, we’re not busy; our mind is left to itself. Plus, it’s partially concentrated on the sole process of walking.  That’s why a long enough walk can put you in a sort of trance. It’ll allow you to relax and think about things differently.

"Kim Jong Un wants Donald Trump back, elite defector tells BBC | BBC News","Donald Trump returning to the White House would be “a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity” for North Korea, according to Ri Il Kyu - one of the highest-ranking defectors.

Mr Ri escaped North Korea in 2016 and has since been face to face with Kim Jong Un on seven separate occasions.

He says that North Korea still views Mr Trump as someone it can negotiate with over its nuclear weapons programme, despite talks between him and Kim Jong Un breaking down in 2019.
 
In his first interview with an international broadcaster, Mr Ri provides a rare understanding of what one of the world’s most secretive and repressive states is hoping to achieve.

Lyrics:
What’s your impossible
Your “I need a miracle”
What’s got you barely hanging by a single thread
What looks so hopeless now 
What weighs down your heart with doubt 
You beg for a breakthrough but no sign of breakthrough yet

When you’ve cried and you’ve cried til your tears run dry
The answer won’t come and you don’t know why
And you wonder if you can bow your head even one more time 

Don’t stop praying
Don’t stop calling on Jesus name
Keep on pounding on heaven’s door
Let your knees wear out the floor
Don’t stop believing
‘Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father’s heard every single word you’re saying
So, don’t stop praying

He’s close to the brokenhearted
Saves those who are crushed in spirit
The Alpha and Omega knows how your story ends

When you’ve cried and you’ve cried til your tears run dry
The answer won’t come and you don’t know why
And you wonder if you can bow your head even one more time
Oh, do it one more time

And don’t stop praying
Don’t stop calling on Jesus name
Keep on pounding on heaven’s door
Let your knees wear out the floor
Don’t stop believing
‘Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father’s heard every single word you’re saying
So, don’t stop praying

(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
Oh
(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
Oh, don’t stop praying
(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
Oh (Oh)

Don’t stop praying for the prodigal
Don’t stop praying for the miracle
Hallelujah, hallelujah and amen
Don’t stop praying that addictions end
Don’t stop praying for deliverance
Hallelujah, hallelujah and amen 
Oh, don’t stop praying for the sickness healed 
Don’t stop praying for His power revealed 
Hallelujah, hallelujah and amen
No, don’t stop praying for the kingdom come
Don’t stop praying that his will be done
Hallelujah, hallelujah and amen 

Don’t stop praying
Don’t stop calling on Jesus name
Keep on pounding on heaven’s door
Let your knees wear out the floor
Don’t stop believing
‘Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father’s heard every single word you’re saying
So, don’t stop praying

(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
Oh, don’t stop praying 
(Don’t stop don’t stop praying)
Don’t you give up now (Oh)
No, don’t stop praying

Venezuela's Guaidó appeals to military 'at air force base' - BBC News,"Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has published a video which he says was recorded at an air force base.

The recording shows him surrounded by men in uniform calling for the military to back him in ""ending the usurpation"" of power by President Nicolás Maduro.

The military has so far supported Mr Maduro and refused to back Mr Guaidó.

In the video, Mr Guaidó says he has the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. The government says it has put down a small coup attempt.

The video, published on Mr Guaidó's Twitter account, shows him standing next to another opposition leader, Leopoldo López, who has been under house arrest after he was found guilty of inciting violence during anti-government protests in 2014.

Israel says Gaza ceasefire delayed until Hamas provides list of hostages | BBC News,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a ceasefire in Gaza has been delayed until Hamas releases a list of hostages.

A statement from his office says he instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) not to begin the ceasefire, which was scheduled to take effect at 8:30 local time (06:30 GMT).

Hamas says the delay is due to ""technical field reasons"".

The Israeli leader warned last night that the first phase of the deal to stop fighting in Gaza was “a temporary ceasefire”, and that Israel reserved the right to resume the war, with US backing, if it was to break down.

Mozambique: Health Care in a Warming World,"With more than 1,600 miles of coastline, Mozambique is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has started a new planetary health project in Nampula province, an area prone to extreme weather events that are causing climate-sensitive diseases that used to appear seasonally to become prevalent year-round.
 
“Today, malaria is basically present throughout the year, which is very different from what happened in the past when malaria was seen mostly in the rainy season,” said MSF health promotion supervisor Adamo Armando Palame. Changing weather patterns over the last decade have resulted in shorter but heavier rainy seasons, resulting in the creation of lots of small lakes in which mosquitoes breed throughout the year. The heavy rains also wash away crops and impact agricultural yields, affecting food production and people’s income. Read more at https://bit.ly/3FBXFq7

Bangkok Street Food - Kuay Teow Kua Gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่),"Eating Bangkok street food, you'll discover a number of different fried noodle dishes (Pad Thai is probably the most famous), and kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่) is one of my favorites. Get more details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/04/kuay-teow-kua-gai-nai-hong-bangkok/

Kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่) is a Thai fried noodle dish, that's one of the least common types available - it's not just available at any Bangkok Street food stall you stumble upon - you have to go to the right places - and I've had quite a few bad versions of the dish as well. Located around the Phlap Plha Chai area of Bangkok, just a short distance from Yaowarat Chinatown, is a little back alley, that's known very well by locals as the spot in Bangkok for kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่). There are about five different restaurants to choose from, each serves the same dish, with their own unique style and taste.

Probably the most famous Bangkok street food stall serving this dish is a restaurant known as Kuay Teow Kua Gai Nai Hong (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่นายฮ้ง). This place is located in a serious back alley, and let me tell you, this is some proper street food dining in Bangkok. The cook sits in the middle of the alley, frying up noodles like the master, and tables are set up on both sides of the alley.

But what is kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่)? It is a Thai fried noodle dish, made from fresh wide rice noodles, the same ones that are used for other Thai street food dishes like pad see ew and pad kee mao. The only other ingredients are chicken, pickled squid, an egg, and a light seasoning of salt and maybe some pepper - and that's really about all that goes into the dish. The reason it's so popular to eat and it tastes so incredibly delicious, is the way that it's made. At this awesome Bangkok street food stall, the chef used charcoal to heat up a wok that was full of oil. She basically waited until the oil was burning, and tossed in the chicken and noodles, and stir fried them in a puff of smoke. The result of cooking on high fire, gave the noodles and other ingredients its incredible char on the outside. The noodles were actually sticky, but at the same time they had the most beautiful crunch to them.

If you love to eat Thai style fried noodles, you're absolutely going to love kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่). It has such an amazing smoky flavor, and the texture of the ingredients taste so well together. After I finished my first bowl, I decided I wouldn't be satisfied without having another bowl. But just before ordering a second bowl, I noticed on the menu that they had another dish, that was almost the same, except with no noodles and just extra egg. Again she used quite a generous portion of oil, heated it to extreme temperature, fried some chicken, and then poured an egg mixture into the pan. About a minute later, I had the most amazing Bangkok street omelet that I've had a very very long time.

Kuay Teow Kua Gai Nai Hong (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่นายฮ้ง) is a very local Bangkok style restaurant to eat an authentic version of kuay teow kua gai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่). The food is a little on the salty and oily side, but wow is it extraordinarily tasty.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol arrested after dramatic hours-long standoff | BBC News,"South Korean authorities have arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces charges of insurrection following an unsuccessful attempt to impose martial law.
 
Yoon is now at the Corruption Investigation Office. He said he agreed to the interrogation ""even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed"".
 
Authorities served the warrant after an hours-long standoff with his security staff and supporters, which saw investigators using ladders and wirecutters to enter Yoon's residence.
 
This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a sitting president has been arrested.
 
Yoon had been holed up for weeks - investigators tried to arrest him earlier this month but failed.

Overnight, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index jumped by 10.23%, or 3,217 points in its biggest one day gain in points, after the previous day's plummet.

Focus has now shifted to US stock markets, which open in a few hours, after a couple of days of torrid trading.
 
The Nikkei's 12% slump at the start of the week weighed on global stock markets. Sharp share price drops in UK, Europe, and US followed.

NASA Honors First Two Americans in Orbit on This Week @ NASA,"The Kennedy Space Center hosted several events to celebrate 50 years of Americans in orbit. John Glenn, the first to achieve the goal, made his three-orbit flight in Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962. Three months later, fellow Mercury astronaut Scott Carpenter followed Glenn with his flight aboard Aurora 7 on May 24, 1962. Glenn and Carpenter spoke to employees and met with the media sharing stories about their adventures. Glenn also received a congratulatory message from the crew aboard The International Space Station during an in-flight call at the NASA Future Forum at the Ohio State University.

Good Neighbours - Introducing Good Neighbours | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025,"Introducing Good Neighbours | Vevo DSCVR Artists To Watch 2025

Oli and Scott of Good Neighbours are always welcome to new flat mates. That’s how the Brit duo behind posi anthems “Keep It Up” and “Home,” actually met. Both had found plenty of success as solo artists. Oli had opened for Sigrid; Scott made a name for himself in the London indie scene under the moniker kwassa (shoutout Vampire Weekend). But when they ended up living adjacent to each other, like every great relationship, they unlocked and elevated one another. United by their love of MGMT, Passion Pit, and A24 films, the duo harness the sounds of the Indie Golden Era to make coming-of-age earworms. The prime example is “Home,” which would sound right at home on an ’09 iPod Nano. It’s one the most-streamed debut singles of the year, grabbing more than 270 million streams and charting in a dozen countries. A self-titled EP, released in October, proved their euphoric well runs deep with tracks like “Daisies.” As for 2025, the focus is on finishing an album, “playing better and bigger shows, and just enjoying the ride.” Welcome to the good neighbourhood.

Lead Contamination Beyond Flint: Drinking Water and Children's Health,"On the whole, American drinking water is safe. However, more than a year after toxic lead levels forced a federal state of emergency in Flint, MI, 63 percent of Americans report that they worry a great deal about polluted drinking water. This statistic comes from a new Gallup poll indicating that water pollution ranks the highest of six environmental concerns among respondents. While pipes in Flint are expected to be replaced with the help of a $97 million settlement, there are other cities with histories of unsafe lead levels — or other toxins — in drinking water. These contaminants can threaten health, particularly among children. This Forum grappled with safekeeping American drinking water supplies. Does the drinking water infrastructure need replacement? How would such an effort look? Do public alert systems help? What about other potential lead exposure sources? What is the role of regulation in a time of proposed deep cuts to EPA funding? What does the public need to know? This timely discussion was held in advance of Earth Day.

Presented April 20, 2017, jointly with The Huffington Post.

A number of countries, including Thailand, Bulgaria and Norway, have all paused rollouts in recent days over safety fears. The suspensions followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine.

But the WHO has encouraged countries to keep their vaccination programmes in place.

We Deliver Free Medical Facility to the World .
''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

"If You See This On Your Car, Don't Touch It And Ask for Help!","How to Protect Yourself from Car Thieves. Criminals regularly invent new scam schemes to rid you of your car or belongings that you forgetfully leave in it. The only way to protect your car from being stolen and save yourself from thieve attacks is to stay alert and well-informed and follow some essential safety tips.

How to deal with a GPS tracker on your car 1:03
Criminals use magnetic GPS trackers they can even throw out of the window of their car that is passing by your vehicle. The trackers will lead robbers to your flat or house. In addition, they will be able to find out when you leave your car in a deserted place and get inside. If you locate a magnetic tracker attached to your car, remove it in a random place that is far from your home or work and is off the way to these locations. After you remove the tracker, take a photo of the device to provide some evidence to the police.

How to stay safe abroad 4:30
People tend to feel more relaxed on holiday that's why they just don't register the same threat they are well aware of in their home country. For example, in Spain, there have been numerous cases when criminals targeted drivers of foreign-registered cars. When abroad, always park your car in sight, if you leave your car, take all valuable belongings with you. Be extra cautious of those people who flag you down. 

""Smash-and-grab"" approach 5:30
Car robbers come up to your car when you're waiting at a traffic light or suffer in a traffic jam, smash the car window, and grab anything expensive they can see. While you can do nothing with waiting in the traffic, you can cover the windows of your car with a protective safety film.

How to ensure the safety of your car 6:25
Leave your doors open and your windows rolled down if you park your car in a ""bad"" neighborhood. If you want to make your vehicle unappealing to car robbers, make it as messy inside as possible. Don't leave anything (literally anything) in sight. Make sure that the measures you've taken to protect your car are visible.

SUMMARY
-If you see a GPS tracker on your car, be extremely cautious. Criminals use them to stalk you, pure and simple.
-When abroad, be extra cautious of those people who flag you down. Your valuables should be not only out of reach but also out of sight.
-Robbers need a fast getaway. If they have to bash your car window again and again, they will most likely get caught. So, do everything you can to make your windows as impact-absorbent as possible.
-Leave anything that has value (CD's, sports equipment, GPS, suitcases) in the trunk of your car. Park in well-lit areas. Under a street lamp, criminals feel uncomfortable and exposed. If you want to make your vehicle unappealing to car robbers, make it as messy inside as possible.

Scores of whales to be euthanised after mass stranding in Australia | BBC News,"Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.

A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.

They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.

Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.

Amazon Street Food in Belém - UNBELIEVABLE TACACÁ + 13 Lady’s Cooked Lunch at Market in Brazil!,"🎥Unseen SUPERFOOD in Amazon Jungle: https://youtu.be/iGU6dXuIcJE
🍌Banana Chips available now!! https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens

Thanks to Guilherme (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKjl-xepqcSTkJGR9pq_vQ) for taking us around Brazil. #Belém #BrazilianFood #streetfood

BELÉM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It’s all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cachaça - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cachaça, Brazil’s sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it’s serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There’s nothing like Amazon fruits and here’s the juices we tried: Cupuaçu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here’s where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Belém!

Tacacá Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacacá, I still can’t believe how good it is, and how it’s not loved all over the world! We also had Vatapá. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Rosário Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Rosário Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Belém, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Discrimination in America: African American Experiences,"How do African Americans experience discrimination in daily life? A new poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the Harvard T.H.

This Forum explored the poll results and their implications for a healthier, more equitable, and just society.

This poll is the first among a series of reports that surveyed additional groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, men, women, and LGBTQ adults, on their experiences with discrimination.

What Actually Happened to the Titanic Survivors,"In the early hours of April 15th, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic, the famous British passenger liner RMS Titanic sank to the ocean depths, leaving just 706 survivors. What ever became of them after this tragedy? Well, some of them went on to live long and incredible lives! 

For example, have you ever heard about “The Unsinkable Molly Brown?” She's one of the most popular and liked characters in the 1964 movie, and earlier Broadway musical, based on the great ship’s unlucky maiden voyage. But this woman wasn’t just thought up by some Hollywood screenwriter, she was a real passenger!

SUMMARY:
- “The Unsinkable Molly Brown” is one of the most popular and liked characters in the 1964 movie, and earlier Broadway musical, based on the great ship’s unlucky maiden voyage.
- But this woman wasn’t just thought up by some Hollywood screenwriter, she was a real passenger! 
- Speaking of incredible women, throughout her career working at sea, Miss Violet Constance Jessop survived not one but three shipwrecks, the Titanic included.
- The actress Dorothy Gibson, most famous for her role in the 1912 movie “Saved from the Titanic,” was actually one of the survivors of the catastrophe.
- Not long after Gibson arrived in New York aboard the Carpathia, her agent convinced her to star in a movie about the Titanic’s sinking. She wrote the script herself and wore the same clothes in the movie that she did on the night of the disaster!
- One of the most heartbreaking outcomes of the Titanic’s sinking was that it tore families apart. The Navratil brothers, Master Michel Marcel and Master Edmond Roger were just toddlers when they boarded the Titanic with their father. 
- Their mother eventually saw them in the newspaper, and the family reunited a month after the sinking.
- Eva Miriam Hart was only 7 years old when she boarded the Titanic with her parents. According to Eva, her mother couldn't sleep at all the whole time she was on board because she’d had a really bad premonition about the trip. 
- Joseph Bruce Ismay was Chairman of White Star Line, the company that operated the Titanic. He was on the ship that night, survived the sinking, and was rescued in Collapsible Lifeboat C.
- Professional tennis player Richard Norris Williams was on board the Titanic with his father. Given that the lifeboats, as many know, were reserved for women and children, these two guys were left to fend for themselves on a sinking ship.
- Perhaps it was purely coincidental or maybe something more, but the resulting wave washed Richard towards Collapsible Lifeboat A, so he climbed in.

What If a Train Engine is Replaced with a Jet Engine (and 17 Unbelievable Vehicles),"What are the most unusual modes of transportation? Maglevs, space shuttles, funiculars —seems like we’ve seen it all. But few people know there were — and still are! — types of transport that you could only imagine in your wildest dreams. How about jet-powered trains? Or bicycles with sewing machines installed in them?

Ever heard of dog sleds? In 1939, a certain Z. Wiggs, 80-year-old dog trainer, thought it was time for the dog sled to evolve and created his muttmobile. It looked like a love child of a car and a hamster wheel: the driver controlled the car, while a dog sitting in a huge wheel behind him walked or ran, generating energy. Cool idea, isn't it?

Palestinians return to ruins of north Gaza after Israeli withdrawal | BBC News,"Thousands of Palestinians have been returning to their homes in northern Gaza after Israeli forces withdrew from a key militarised zone that had cut the territory in half.  

Many of the returning people will find their homes reduced to rubble.  Around 700,000 civilians fled their neighbourhoods at the time of Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza.

The northern part of the Gaza Strip had been cut off from the south by the Netzarim Corridor.  The Israeli withdrawal from the strategically important road was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

Gospel Song

I could listen to my heart
I could listen to the world
I could listen to my problems
But what I think I need to hear
Nice and loud and crystal clear
Is about the who’s gonna solve them
 
Oh
I need something that can fill my soul
Oh
On a record or the radio
 
Ain’t nothing like a gospel song
Makes me want to sing it all day long
Something ‘bout that amazing grace sound of praise
Makes my troubles not seem so strong
Let me hear a heart set free
Holy Bible to a melody
Turn it up and then play it again, play it again, play it
On and on and on
Ain’t nothing like a gospel song
 
Let me stop and testify
I was dead and brought to life
By the power of my Savior
But if I’m being real with you
Sometimes I forget it’s true
I could use a reminder
 
Oh
I need something that can fill my soul
Oh
On a record or the radio
 
I will sing, I will sing the name of Jesus 
I will sing, I will sing of all he’s done
I will sing, I will sing the name of Jesus
I will sing, I will sing ‘til kingdom come

What Happens to Your Body When a Mosquito Bites You,"Mosquitos can ruin a nice picnic in the park, camping out with your friends, even your own humble abode! They’re innumerable, and they come in swarms just about anywhere you go. They are the single worst thing about summer! Why do they have to bite, and why does it itch like crazy?  It’s high time we got some answers! 

Mosquitos are ancient critters thought to have evolved between 50 and 100 million years ago. And they proved to be a highly adaptable species. Except for Antarctica, they live on all continents in a variety of climates. There are about 3,000 different species of mosquitos all around the world. Btw, did you know that not all mosquitos suck blood? Only females drink blood, while male specimen feed solely on nectar. The good news is, you can tell the difference between the two!

#mosquitos #insects #brightside

SUMMARY:
- You can tell the difference between the two! Male mosquitos are a bit smaller than females. And if you see one nearby with fancy-looking feathered antennae, don’t rush to smack it just yet – it’s a male and it won’t bite you no matter what.
- A mosquito’s lifespan is only about a month or two. Well, that’s for the females. The guys live a lot shorter: around 2 weeks. 
- You shouldn’t have any standing water near your house if you don’t want a mosquito invasion!
- Contrary to popular belief, mosquitos don’t search for their prey looking for lights. To be fair, there aren’t many species that prefer human blood at all. 
- They have a variety of methods, but they mostly use scent. More specifically, they’re sniffing for your body heat and the one thing every living breathing thing produces constantly: carbon dioxide, or CO2.
- Mosquitos can remember the scent of a particularly aggressive prey and avoid it completely for 24 hours. That means, if a mosquito tries to bite you and you decide to brush it off or swat at it, it’ll probably choose someone else to bite next!
- They stick not 1 but 6 needles in you! Some of those have razor-sharp teeth that cut through the skin.
- The mosquito injects its saliva immediately after it bites you. The saliva consists of more than 100 different components, most of which are these organic substances called enzymes. 
- There are also other components used like a local anesthesia.
- Females need blood to develop eggs. More specifically, she needs loads of protein and iron, which blood happens to be rich in.

Dermot Kennedy - Dermot Kennedy - Glory (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Dermot Kennedy - Glory an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music.

Some singers bring it from the heart, some from the gut. When Dermot Kennedy lays into a lyric, his voice unites both regions, and the result is utterly expressive. The Irish singer-songwriter, who learned his craft in the shadow of heroes such as Glen Hansard and David Grey (two other artists who know about wearing their heart on their sleeve) is becoming more and more expert at calibrating drama. As his 2013 EP 'Dancing Under Red Skies' indicated, his songs strive for the epic, and they often attain their goal. 2016's """"After Rain"""" resonated with lots of listeners - check those Spotify numbers - and his inspired production (tempered with hip-hop elements) on the 'Doves & Ravens' EP is giving his folk-pop essence a bit more muscle...and earning him lots of new fans as well. Passion is key to the young singer's approach. You'll see it immediately in our DSCVR performance of """"Glory."""" Share with anyone who is looking for the real deal.

Director: That Jam 
Producer: Nick Calafato

29 SITUATIONS EVERY GIRL CAN RELATE TO,"BAD LUCK COMPILATION

Check out funny situations that every girl can relate to. Some girls are really unlucky and we prepared a bad luck compilation that is really funny! Do you usually spill coffee in a car especially when a beautiful guy is looking at you? Wearing glasses is not a comfortable thing at all but the real failure is when you place your eyeglasses on a couch and your friend accidentally sits on them. Always remember that bad luck can turn into happiness! 
Another compilation of scenes is about two types of girls. Every girl differs from another and has a unique nature, habits, and appearance but it’s easy to distinguish two main types of girls. The first type prefers wearing comfortable clothes like jeans, t-shirts, and hoodie, she doesn’t like to wear makeup. Moreover, this type of girls prefer comfort even if it’s cold outside and wears a puffy jacket, scarf, and a hat but the second always looks fashionable no matter if it’s hot like in Sahara or cold like in the Arctic. As for the second type, this girl loves to look chic and sexy and is well groomed 24/7. She prefers wearing fancy dresses, high heels, and shorts and makes the best and glamorous selfies and perfect shots for Facebook. One more difference is the costumes for Halloween: the second type usually wears funny costumes, drink with friends and have fun. The second type prefers sexy costumes and makes selfies and perfect shots the whole evening. Always remember that you should completely love yourself and accept yourself as you are.

TIMESTAMPS:
00:09 Bad luck compilation
01:12 Kitchen failures
03:39 What kind of girl are you?
04:32 Do you prefer healthy food?

How to interpret an expression with function notation | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy,"Courses on Khan Academy are always 100% free. Start practicing—and saving your progress—now:  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:functions/x2f8bb11595b61c86:interpreting-function-notation/v/interpreting-function-notation-example-2


Sal interprets the expression P(5) minor P(9) where P models the number of people at the beach over time.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

"Asteroid Sample Return Mission Launches on This Week @NASA – September 9, 2016","On Sept. 8, NASA launched the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security - Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. OSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. mission to sample an asteroid, is scheduled to arrive at near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018. Mission plans call for the spacecraft to survey the asteroid, retrieve a small sample from its surface, and return the sample to Earth for study in 2023. Analysis of that sample is expected to reveal clues about the history of Bennu over the past 4.5 billion years, as well as clues about the evolution of our solar system.

We drove to Thingvellir National Park to a rift called Silfra which is a fissure between the North American and Eurasion tectonic plates. The water is nearly freezing, but we swam in it for an hour! Wearing drysuits for the first time was a fun experience and made the snorkel trip so much better. The water was unbelievably clear. This was definitely one of the best adventures we took in Iceland!!!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +CaseyNeistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)

Celeste - Strange - an exclusive live performance for Vevo DSCVR ARTISTS TO WATCH 2020, an annual series highlighting performers that are shaping the future of music.
 
Maybe we should thank the church. Celeste's unique voice was nurtured by daily participation in services with her mom while living in the UK’s Brighton as a child. And unique it certainly is, with a fiery temperament that can either soothe or incite. Some writers suggest a blend of Amy Winehouse and Billie Holiday in Celeste’s vocal approach, and they’re not far off base; as the 24-year-old Brit fits her phrases into one of her smokey songs, a certain kind of classicism is being brought into the present tense. The skills she uses to achieve this feat were nurtured along the way. There’s the influential spirit of those hymns she loved, and for awhile she enjoyed a performing arts school scholarship to bolster her talent. And paying attention to life opened her eyes even more. When Brighton became a bit claustrophobic, she was off to London to have her gifts further celebrated. A string of songs trickled out, an artistic approach was refined, and and audience began to grow. From “Chocolate” to “Father’s Son” to “Strange” an enticing confidence continues to blossom in her music. When you watch her take over our studio for the latter song and “Lately,” you’ll get a feel for the way she effortlessly unites both charm and power.

Nina Chuba - Wildberry Lillet (Live) | Vevo DSCVR,"Nina Chuba - Wildberry Lillet (Live). An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Nina Chuba is in the right place in Berlin, a city with a club scene that rewards artists crafting party-ready bangers. As if in competition with herself, every recent release from hip-pop singer-songwriter ratchets up the nightlife energy more than the last. “Molly Moon” blasted gurgling 808s and a fusion of German and English. “Tracksuit Velours” is an ode to the perfect outfit for those partying longer than 24 hours at once.  “Femminello” and ""Wildberry Lillet"" are further proof of Chuba's mood-capturing abilities. She  wrote the former during a stay at a Sicilian songwriting camp where she indulged in “good weather, good people, good food, good songs.” No need to sprechen Deutsch to feel those pleasures coming from these DSCVR performances - the citrus yellow and bluish berry hues of the studio lighting along with Chuba’s sparkling grin will instantly transport you to a sunny state of mind.

President Trump tells America he was “saved by God” to bring “golden age” of prosperity | BBC News,"Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 47th president of the United States, beginning his second term in the White House after a decisive comeback in November's election.

In his inauguration speech, Trump promised to restore the American dream while also warning of what he described as chaos and destruction left by the previous administration.

""The golden age of America begins right now,"" he declared. ""From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected."" It was a far cry from his speech eight years ago, when the Republican painted a dark picture of a wounded American industry and economy taken advantage of by foreign exploitation.

Trump said he would declare a national emergency at the southern border and deploy national troops for immigration enforcement, action he promised on the campaign trail.  And he said he would sign an executive order meant to ""immediately stop censorship and bring back free speech in America"".

Trump also promised dramatic action overseas. He said wanted the Panama Canal under US control, falsely claiming it is currently operated by China. Panama has sovereignty over the waterway.  ""We're taking it back,"" Trump said.

Trump also vowed to ""pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars"".  The promise was met with a smile from tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has long said he wants humans to colonise the planet.

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

What If Everyone on Earth Looked the Same,"Picture this: it’s a beautiful morning, and you woke up to the sound of birds chirping through your half-opened window. You look out the window see a few people walking by. But there’s a problem. They all look the same. With identical skin and hair color, when you look closer, even their face is the same. You are in a world filled with identical humans... 

It’s as if a factory produced humans in the same way dolls are manufactured – minus the package, of course. These identical creatures come into the world naturally, but they don’t just have a name. They also have a number. So, what would the world be like if it were possible? How would you identify all your friends and relatives?

Zach Braff (zachbraff/18.06.2017): ""Happy Father's Day from my family to yours"": By Instagram.com/FaceToFace/REPORTER/East News, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/picture/id/56724093/i/5/t/127
Animation is created by Bright Side.

SUMMARY:
- In the parallel universe #12, every person is born with the same face.
- To keep the world in order, the government came up with a numerical system that gave each person a number. 
- To make sure that nobody lost their unique identity, they had tiny microchips placed in their chests.
- When you become friends with someone, the chips connected through something like Bluetooth. 
- The world of social media in this parallel Universe is completely different from what we’re used to. The accounts aren’t based on photos but on intelligence. 
- If you all look like every other person, you have to use your achievements and intelligence to have it.
- You see, in this world, only your achievements and character could make you different, so people used that to their advantage.
-  Us humans like to label people who have a different appearance. And we usually pick on the negative. We categorize individuals on the way they look, and their weight.
- Creativity in that world is limited. It’s hard to imagine something different when you are exposed to the same stimuli. 
- People began changing their bodies and postures to help them stand out. 
- I began to realize that this perfect society wouldn’t last long. People were desperate about having a unique identity, so they were working hard to get it.  
- If everyone looked the same, it might solve a lot of problems, but it would also create new ones. The sciences would probably sky-rocket, but creativity could go either way.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel & Events,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97hG_gksW-A

Why This Country Is Becoming the Richest in the World,"Norway is on its way to becoming one of the richest countries in the world, thanks to its vast oil and gas reserves. The country has been smart about managing its wealth by investing profits from oil into a huge savings fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, which is now worth over a trillion dollars. Norway also has a strong welfare system, providing free healthcare and education to its citizens. Even though the country is rich in resources, it’s also a leader in renewable energy, working toward a greener future. The state encourages innovation, creating new jobs in tech and sustainable industries.

Dëathschleife! Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio vs Jaguar Project 8—Head2Head Preview Episode 112,"Watch this episode on Motor Trend: https://bit.ly/2YNDIVw
On this episode of Head 2 Head, Jethro Bovingdon and Jonny Lieberman set out to see if the mighty Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio has finally met a car it can’t beat. Ever since its first comparison test, the Ferrari-engined sport sedan has laid waste to the competition. For a very good reason, too: the 505hp Italian is the real deal. Enter Jaguar’s bonkers Project 8. There’s a run of the mill XW sedan lurking somewhere underneath, but you’d be hard-pressed to say where, as 80 percent of the Project 8’s hardware is new. Most importantly, there’s a 592hp supercharged V-8 lurking below all that custom carbon-fiber body work and a trick AWD system and fancy racing suspension, too.",Autos & Vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BPhZIxV9Y

Lyrics:
You think I’m pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I’m funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let the walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright, but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You’ll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let’s go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we’ll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I’m a living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can’t Sleep
Let’s run away
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel
And built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzlepiece
I’m complete

Let’s go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we’ll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I’m a living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can’t sleep
Let’s run away
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back

I’ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
tonight, tonight, tonight, Tonight

‘Cause you make me
Feel like I’m a living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can’t sleep
Let’s run away
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back

I’ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
tonight, tonight, tonight, Tonight

Cape Town - where eight people are murdered a day - BBC News,"Cape Town is a well-known tourist hotspot, but also one of the most divided and dangerous cities in the world.

It has seen an average of eight murders a day, for the first six months of this year.

In one weekend in July, 43 people were killed.
The South African Army has now been deployed to help stop the violence. In some cases, residents are forming vigilante groups.

The BBC's Vauldi Carelse and cameraman Christian Parkinson spent a weekend on the streets of the city with both the police and the army, as well as the families of those killed.

You Were Wrong About Spices: The Real Flavor Facts,"Spices are not just about making your food taste good – they are like culinary superheroes with legit health benefits. Take turmeric, for example – it's not just a pretty color; it's got anti-inflammatory superpowers. And cinnamon? It's not just for your morning coffee kick; it might actually help regulate blood sugar. So, next time you're sprinkling those spices, you're not just adding flavor; you're doing your body a solid. It's time to rethink our spice game – they're not just taste enhancers; they're flavor-packed health boosters! 🌶️🍲

Why Buses Open Doors on Railroad Tracks,"Before it became law, school buses didn’t have to open their doors at railroads. Sure, they stopped to check for an oncoming train. But when visibility is low, say, in fog or during a snowstorm, that method can prove dangerously ineffective. 

Everything changed in the 1930s, but the situation still wasn’t ideal. Originally, a student was assigned as a “lookout” during each ride. They’d get off the bus once it stopped and look both ways down the railroad crossing. This continued until it was decided that it was too big a responsibility put on these young volunteers’ shoulders.

🚍 The most fascinating bus facts 🚍 4:51

#buses #schoolbus #brightside

SUMMARY:
- It all comes down to safety and lessons learned. By opening the door AND their side window, a bus driver is better able to hear if a train is coming. 
- Besides coming to a full stop 5 to 15 feet before the crossing (plus opening the door and window), bus drivers must turn off anything that creates distracting sounds, including the radio and fans.
- White reflects the sun’s heat better, so it keeps the inside of the bus 10° cooler. 
- The dark tint of the windows blocks a lot of sunlight from getting in, and it retains interior heat in the winter!
- Most buses don’t have power steering. This system normally helps the driver use less force to turn the wheels. Buses don’t have it because there’s always the risk that it could fail. 
- So far, 8 have passed laws requiring school buses to have seatbelts. Occasionally, individual school districts have the freedom to decide whether to implement them.
- There are currently about 427,000 school buses in America alone! 
- If you’ve ever dreamed of owning your own big yellow bus, you can go to eBay now and purchase one for about $3,000. 
- An average school bus can reach a max of 65 mph (although local speed limit laws for them are usually much lower!).
- The largest bus in the world is the Neoplan Jumbocruiser. They stopped production in 1992, but the jumbo-sized coach didn’t disappoint!
- The first buses were pretty much horse-drawn farm wagons in the late 1800s. The carriage was labeled “Public School” and it transported children that lived far away. (Most kids still walked to school at that time.)
- According to the American School Bus Council, buses save an estimated $7.7 billion every year! 
- Buses also help our environment. If every child in a community rode the bus to school, it would save more than 2 billion gallons of fuel! 
-  One education report found that students who rode the bus were much less likely to miss school.
- There are perks to being a school bus driver! On field trips, they’re sometimes gifted free entrance to those destinations.

Lyrics:
Woke up this morning, I prayed for the bad 
‘Cause I came through the fire, thank God I survived
I done been in the jungle so long, it made me real strong
God gave me the heart of a lion
Gotta watch for these liars they’ll throw you in fire
Some people don't care if you dead or alive
I can see the animosity in their eyes, 
‘fore it get deadly, God take away my pride
Switch up my flows like I switch up my clothes
Thankin' the Lord that he made me, I'm chose
I grew up from the concrete like a rose
I grew up where it wasn’t sweet: à la mode
Jumped out the whip, let's go
We destined for more, we ballin' let’s run up the score
They smile at my face, don't know why
I pay it no mind, can't fool with these snakes on the road
God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it 
I don't wanna be labeled as counterfeit
I see evil is back on the prowl again
God I want you to come in my heart again
I've been lost if I'm bein' so honest
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay
I feel like NK, “City We Became”
That’s by Jemisen, we stuck in a race
Like rats in a pen, I gotta keep faith
This stress I ignored it for like ten years straight
I hope I'm not too late, I got no time to waste
I been down way too long, wanna see better days 
Man, why does it feel like I'm caught in a maze?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
I needed someone, tell me where were you at? 
You told me that you'd always be there
Don't know why you put them lies in my head 
I just got free, left all a mess
I fight for the best and they fight for the rest
Light shinin' like my ice in the sun 
Who said a child of God can't be blessed?

Woke up this morning, I prayed for the best
‘Cause I came through the fire, thank God I survived
Been in the jungle so long, it made me real strong
God gave me the heart of a lion
Watch for these liars that throw you in fire
Some people don't care if you dead or alive
I can see the animosity in their eyes, 
‘fore it get deadly, God take away my pride

God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it 
I don't wanna be labeled as counterfeit
I see evil is back on the prowl again
God I want you to come in my heart again
I've been lost if I'm bein' so honest
Yeah, yeah
God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it
God whatever you want, I want all of it 
I don't wanna be labeled as counterfeit
I see evil is back on the prowl again
God I want you to come in my heart again
I've been lost if I'm bein' so honest

Algebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a ""gatekeeper"" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

If your doormat is too slippery, you can add some cling film underneath it and stick it to the floor. The clingfilm will create enough friction to prevent the matt from sliding. 
You can use the lid from a tin container and hold it by the ring to actually cut your veggies. This will prevent you from having an accident while using a knife. 
You can repurpose a napkin holder into a kitchen cleaning sponge holder to keep your sink more organized. 
Don’t throw wine corks away. You can repurpose them into drawer handles for your furniture. 
I also show you how to recycle old items in your home and turn them into useful organizers. For example, you can use paper bags, cut them to the length you want and then fill them with what you need to organize. 
I show you how to polish your silver using some toothpaste and a sponge. Simply, slid a hole in your kitchen sponge and then fill it up with toothpaste. After that, dip it in some water and start polishing. Toothpaste has calcium carbonate and it’s used to remove scratches and little particles form our teeth, so it will work wonders on your silvers.

Geometry on Khan Academy: We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large--from math to architecture to biology to astronomy (and everything in between). Learning geometry is about more than just taking your medicine (""It's good for you!""), it's at the core of everything that exists--including you. Having said all that, some of the specific topics we'll cover include angles, intersecting lines, right triangles, perimeter, area, volume, circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, analytic geometry, and geometric constructions. Wow. That's a lot. To summarize: it's difficult to imagine any area of math that is more widely used than geometry.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Ethiopia human rights Commission: At least 600 killed in Tigray massacre - BBC News,"Ethiopia's human rights Commission says at least 600 civilians were killed in a massacre in the northern Tigray state earlier this month.

A spokesman for the UN humanitarian affairs agency, Saviano Abreu, said it had been blocked from sending staff or supplies.

The UN refugee agency says the number of people who've crossed into Sudan has climbed to 40,000.

The UN Security Council is due to hold its first meeting later on Tuesday to discuss the fighting in Tigray.

LYRICS:
One, two, three, four!
 
Have you ever worried all night til dusk start
Feels like the sun peeked through your blinds and say good morning
I swear this can’t be made up, but everyday that I wake up
Living in God’s favor, and heaven’s showing me what it’s made of
 
My angels put in work for me (let him work)
My angels put in work for me (let him work)
My angels put in work for me (let him work)
 
Heaven doesn’t work just in church honey
That’s why these things (oh let heaven work for you)
Keep working for me (let heaven work)
 
Bee bops
I’m just working, I’m Just working
You’ve got to trust in his word
 
Do you ever find yourself crippled by the thoughts of anxiety
You keep stressing, palms start sweating, or simply forget to breathe
But if you find it in his word, then it’s gonna work
If you can keep your faith up
And heaven’s showing me what it’s made of, yea

Lily Allen in Calais: 'I apologise on behalf of my country'- BBC News,"The Calais ‘jungle’ camp is due for demolition. The UK Home Secretary has vowed to speed up plans to resettle hundreds of vulnerable children from the camp after talks with France. Charities have been stepping up their pressure on the UK government - they say there are a thousand children in the camp unaccompanied - and demolition will mean children go missing. The singer Lily Allen has been to meet children living in the jungle with charity Help Refugees. Our reporter Catrin Nye went with her.

From an adventurous balloon ride above the clouds to a monster-filled metropolis, Academy Award®-winning director Pete Docter (“Monsters, Inc.,” “Up”) has taken audiences to unique and imaginative places. In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",Film & Animation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DTsdSdSne4
What is Stress?: Highlight from Managing Stress: Protecting Your Health,"Sustained over time, stress can undermine health in serious and sometimes deadly ways. In this Forum event, expert participants examined what we know about the effects of stress on health, including heart disease risk, and about the role social status plays in exacerbating or mitigating these effects. In addition, panelists explored ways in which positive well-being, mindfulness, exercise and nutrition contribute to a more resilient, healthier lifestyle. Presented in collaboration with The Huffington Post.

He calls for no-deal to be taken off the table, and says the Labour Party's proposal is the suitable alternative.

Mr Corbyn says the prime minister ""knows full well"" the damage a no-deal Brexit would do.

He adds that Labour's plan is a ""negotiated customs union, access to the market and protection of rights"".

He says the prime minister has run down the clock, ""but now the clock has run down on her"", noting that ""it is time for a general election.""

What Next Year Would Be If Air Became Unbreathable,"It has been several decades since gas masks have become a part of the face of each person on Earth. From birth to their last day, every inhabitant of our planet is forced to wear a gas mask. No one knows precisely what happened, but one day all the oxygen on the planet became toxic to the lungs. Somehow, the poisoned oxygen gets into the body through the eyes and ears, too, so you can't wear a mask covering only your nose and mouth. A gas mask with full head protection is required.

In the beginning, people couldn't get used to gas masks. Your skin is very irritated, itchy, you want to breathe deeply. And this is only after the first few hours of wearing a mask. Unfortunately, you have to wear your whole life. The worst thing is that there's no salvation anywhere. You can't take off your mask at home. In a small room. While you sleep or while you eat. The only place where you can is vacuum rooms, but inside them, without air, you won't last much longer... Okay, don't be scared. This isn't real. This is just our new what if video. So if you like unusual what if scenarios, you will probably like this one. What if you had to wear a gas mask for the rest of your life?

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

Most INSANE Doner Kebab in Istanbul! (and Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Rome)!,"►Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Check out my Istanbul travel guide: https://goo.gl/gRsk6W

Day 13: Istanbul to Rome on Turkish Airlines - On Day 13 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance, I first had the most insanely amazing doner kebab I’ve ever had, and then we went to the airport, enjoyed the Istanbul Turkish Airlines lounge, before flying with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Rome.

00:53 Tarihi Karadeniz Döner - My friend Tuba from http://istanbulfood.com/ says this place serves the best doner kebab in Istanbul, and she’s no joking around. The first thing you notice when you arrive to Tarihi Karadeniz Döner is the biggest round of doner that you’ll likely ever see in your life - it’s absolutely incredibly beautiful. Many people order their doner kebab for takeaway, but they have some seating upstairs where you can grab a seat and enjoy your doner kebab immediately after its shaved off. I ordered a plate of doner kebab meat, which was absolutely awesome. The meat was shaved perfectly, so it was slightly crispy, yet juicy and flavorful all the way through. Then I also ordered the iskender kebab (İskender kebap), another Turkish food I had been longing to eat. The doner kebab meat is sliced off, then combined with tomato sauce, sheep butter, and yogurt. Finally, to wash down the doner, I also had a cup of ayran. Total price - 46 TL ($15.45)

7:19 Taxi to Istanbul Atatürk Airport - After the amazing doner kebab at Tarihi Karadeniz Döner, we then checked out of our hotel and jumped in a taxi to the airport. Price - 57 TL ($19.14)

8:13 Turkish Airlines Lounge - I haven’t been to too many lounges, but the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul is one of the most amazing airline lounges in the world. There was so much good food and so many drinks and beverage options. I was honestly pretty full after devouring all that doner kebab, but I did have a chance to try Turkish manti and then I went in for some salad.

12:05 Turkish Airlines Flight from Istanbul to Rome - We then caught our flight on Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Rome. Turkish Airlines is an amazing airline with great service, and I love how there’s a chef on board. For lunch I had the kebab and it was pretty good.

16:45 Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport - The flight from Istanbul to Rome didn’t take too long, and we arrive to Rome!

17:16 Bus to Termini Station - 5.90 EUR ($6.59) per person - To get from the airport to the center of Rome we took the bus, which dropped us off at Termini station. From Termini Station we took the Metro to Spagna station.

18:13 Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora - During out time in Rome, we stayed at Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora, located in a great location.

Disclaimer and Thank You: 
Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-the-world) for sponsoring my business class flights. 
Thank you to Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora for sponsoring my stay in Rome.

I personally paid for all food and attractions in this video, and I decided what to do and where to eat.

11 Illegal Things You Do Every Day,"There are some strict laws that many of us have no idea about. Here’s a list of 11 illegal things that you're doing pretty much every day.

You might not even realize it, but there are so many things you probably do on a day-to-day basis that are totally illegal. There are some laws that many of us have no idea about, while others know about them but don’t believe they’ll ever get caught. Bright Side has decided to open your eyes to some of the illegal stuff that you're doing pretty much every day.

TIMESTAMPS
Downloading torrents 0:31
Connecting to public Wi-Fi 1:27
Selling on eBay without declaring your income 2:26
Using a fake name online 3:16
Streaming TV shows 4:12
Eating before paying in the store 5:05
Using copyrighted content 5:50
Texting while driving 6:50
Recording Skype conversations 8:03
Sharing passwords 8:48
Using social media when you’re underage 9:44

SUMMARY
- You can’t legally watch movies without paying for them! And this rule also goes for every single Torrent file. Simply speaking, if the item is copyrighted, and you're not the owner of it, then downloading it for free is 100% against the law. 
- If we're talking about public Wi-Fi, you have to have the provider's permission and follow the terms of service to use it legally. 
- If you sell on eBay but don’t declare your earnings yourself, eBay will submit Form 1099 and report your income to the IRS. 
- Faking your name or ID can send you to prison for 5 to 20 years! Using a fake name is considered “hacking” because you didn't correctly authorize yourself as a computer owner. 
- An easy way to find out if you're watching content legally is to see whether or not there are commercials during the video. If there aren’t any, it's more than likely that your blissful little TV-show-binge-watching party of one is breaking the law.
- According to the law, you must pay for everything before you take it from the store, and your “testing” falls into this category as well.
- Most images are subject to copyright, and it is, in fact, illegal to use them anywhere. When it comes to using copyrighted content, you have to know the rules of something called “fair use”. 
- Even if you're an experienced driver and have lightning-fast thumbs, it's still better to pull over to type that text message or simply wait until you get to where you’re going before you write and send it. In the USA, texting while driving is strictly prohibited in 41 states. 
- According to the law, you can't record any conversation without the other person's consent. In some states the same principle applies to phone calls as well: it's illegal to record them without both parties knowing about it. 
- Sharing your Netflix password, for example, is officially illegal. Having a user's permission isn’t enough if you want to share a password; to do that legally, you must have the permission of the site owner as well!
- You’re not supposed to have WhatsApp until you’re 16! Kids these days probably consider this unfair and find ways to sneak around this rule. So it’s not surprising that according to statistics, more than half of children use social media by the age of 10!

Highest earning YouTubers of 2021 revealed - BBC News,"Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old American better known as MrBeast, was YouTube's highest-earning content creator in 2021, according to Forbes.

His elaborate stunts have generated more than 10 billion views on the platform and earned him $54m (£39m).

He has overtaken 10-year-old toy reviewer Ryan Kaji, who has topped the annual list for the past two years.

Together, the 10 best-paid YouTubers made a combined $300m (£218m) in 2021, the US magazine estimated.

Jake Paul is in second place, his first appearance in the top 10 since 2018, and his brother Logan also returns after being absent since 2017.

Minecraft player Nathan Graham, known as Unspeakable, makes the list for the first time in fifth place.

22 World's Largest Things Ever Existed,"The world is full of all things huge and tiny, but do you know which of all these things are the largest of their kind? Nature creates everything and everyone in all shapes and sizes, which is why our world appears a lot more interesting. But there are mind-boggling human-made things around us! For example, the Rubik's cube that has 6,153 movable parts. 

So, yes, some things are big, really big. London buses big. Pyramids big! But others are simply stupendous! So what are the world's biggest things? Coffee pots that can fill 12,000 cups of coffee, gummy bears that equal 1,400 regular sized candies, cranes capable of lifting 500 elephants – at a time!  These are only a few things from our special list of the world's largest objects!

The Ethiopian government has set aside nearly £130m to deal with the crisis but the UN says a further £330m is needed.

''WHO WE ARE ?WE ARE MSF DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS  '' 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2019, over 35,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[2] Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[3]

Médecins Sans Frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[4] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[5] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[6] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[7] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[8] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.

Hundreds attend vigil for Texas school shooting victims – BBC News,"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil in Uvalde, Texas, after 19 children and two teachers were killed in a mass shooting at a primary school. 

The children who died were aged between seven and 10. Some of them had just received awards for great schoolwork.

The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say.

Many have called for stricter gun buying laws, while others are sceptical that they would stop mass shootings.

What If Sharks And Other Sea Creatures Moved To The Skies?,"Imagine this – sea animals taking to the skies like they own the place! It'd be like a whole new world up there. Picture dolphins doing somersaults through the clouds and whales breaching above the waves. And don't even get me started on flying squids – talk about an aerial acrobatics show! But hey, it's not all fun and games – flying sharks might give you second thoughts about hitting the beach. Still, gotta admit, seeing our underwater buddies spread their wings would be pretty darn cool! 🐬✈️

Patients suffer at home as Covid chokes hospitals  - BBC News,"India is suffering critical shortages of medical equipment and oxygen amid a devastating surge in Covid-19 cases. 

 With the death toll steadily increasing, families are being forced to find their own oxygen and to wait to cremate their loved ones.  Many have turned to the black market, where prices of essential medicines, oxygen cylinders and concentrators have skyrocketed. 

 Most hospitals in the capital Delhi are full and many of them are refusing new admissions due to the uncertainty over oxygen supply.

Supreme Court: Second day of legal prorogation battle - BBC News,"The legal battle over the suspension of Parliament has finished for a second day at the Supreme Court.

The government's lawyer, Sir James Eadie QC, said it was not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" over prorogation as it was a political matter.

But Aidan O'Neill QC, on behalf of campaigners against the move, said it was used ""for an improper purpose"".

Boris Johnson prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks.

The prime minister said it would allow him to hold a Queen's Speech on 14 October to outline his new policies for the coming year.

But critics say his intention was to silence MPs and stop them scrutinising his plans in the run-up to the Brexit deadline on 31 October.

"Tiny Creature Spent 24,000 Years Frozen and Survived","Scientists bring us more and more unusual discoveries every day. Lately they were able to revive a tiny creature that remained frozen for thousands of years.  Its name is bdelloid rotifer and it remained frozen in the Siberian permafrost until recently. But scientists managed to bring it back to life. Does it mean that any organism can spend time in cryptobiosis and then get to live again?

How Joe Biden's $2tn infrastructure plan ranks in US history - BBC News,"US President Joe Biden has set out a a $2tn (£1.4tn) plan that would mark the largest federal investment in infrastructure ""in a generation"".

With the warmth of June sunrise, Angelica Vila’s “More In The Morning” arrived on New York radio airwaves as the perfect soundtrack for a summertime hang. The Bronx native’s smooth vocals and fiery confidence, paired with rollicking guitar licks launched her debut record on the fast track. Her follow up, “All I Do 4 U,” showcases her pipes on the yearning number.
